Abstract = {Despite research interest in testing the effects of literacy-infused
   science interventions in different contexts, research exploring the
   relationship, if any, between academic language and conceptual
   understanding is scant. What little research exists does not include
   English language learners (ELLs) and/or economically disadvantaged (ED)
   student samples students most at risk academically. This study
   quantitatively determined if there exists a relationship, and if so, how
   strong of a relationship, between ELL and ED students' academic language
   and conceptual understanding based on science notebook scores used in a
   larger science and literacy-infused intervention with a sample of
   culturally diverse students. The study also considered strengths of
   relationships between language and concept science notebook scores
   within student language status groups (ELL, former ELL, and English
   speaking). Correlational analyses noted positive, large, and significant
   correlations between students' language and concept scores overall, with
   the largest correlations for science notebook entries using more
   academic language. Large correlations also existed for ELL student
   entries at the end of the school year. Implications of the findings for
   future research and practice in science classrooms including literacy
   interventions, such as science notebooks, with populations of culturally
   diverse students are discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of strategic
   problem solving with peer instruction on college students' performance
   in physics. The students enrolled in 2 sections of a physics course were
   studied; 1 section was the treatment group and the other section was the
   comparison group. Students in the treatment group received peer
   instruction with systematic problem-solving strategies whereas students
   in the comparison group received only peer instruction. Data were
   collected on physics achievement, problem-solving strategies, homework
   problems, and students' opinions about the instruction. Results
   indicated that the treatment group students' homework and achievement
   test performances as well as their visualizing, solving, and checking
   habits improved relative to the comparison group students, which did not
   change noticeably. Treatment group students also changed their
   perspective on solving a problem and found the method helpful to connect
   the quantitative solution with concepts. These results revealed that the
   method could be implemented with little effort so as to assess and

Abstract = {In two dimensions (2D), representations associated with slopes are seen
   in numerous forms before representations associated with derivatives are
   presented. These include the slope between two points and the constant
   slope of a linear function of a single variable. In almost all
   multivariable calculus textbooks, however, the first discussion of
   slopes in three dimensions (3D) is seen with the introduction of partial
   derivatives. The nature of the discussions indicates that authors seem
   to assume that students are able to naturally extend the concept of a 2D
   slope to 3D and correspondingly it is not necessary to explicitly
   present slopes in 3D. This article presents results comparing students
   that do not explicitly discuss slopes in 3D with students that
   explicitly discuss slopes in 3D as a precursor to discussing derivatives
   in 3D. The results indicate that students may, in fact, have significant
   difficulty extending the concept of a 2D slope to a 3D slope. And that
   the explicit presentation of slopes in 3D as a precursor to the
   presentation of derivatives in 3D may significantly improve student
   comprehension of topics of differentiation in multivariable calculus.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to discover the contribution of students'
   interest in school biology, as well as their self-efficacy and attitudes
   towards different science subjects and mathematics when explaining
   students' orientation towards biology-related careers at upper-secondary
   school. The data of 321 K-11 students (49 \% women) were analyzed. Human
   biology and gene technology was the most interesting topics of biology
   among the students. The students' self-efficacy belief was highest in
   geography and lowest in mathematics. Male students had higher
   self-efficacy in mathematics and science subjects, but in biology, no
   gender difference was found. Self-efficacy in biology and geography
   intercorrelated, as did self-efficacy in mathematics, physics, and
   chemistry. Regression analysis revealed that interest and self-efficacy
   in biology and positive attitudes to biology as school subjects
   explained girls' orientation towards a biology-related career, as did
   low self-efficacy in physics and geography. For boys, only interest in
   biology, positive attitudes to biology as a school subject, and
   self-efficacy in biology explained their biology-related career
   orientation. The students' attitudes and self-efficacy beliefs in
   science subjects should be taken into account in secondary school
   biology education, because gender stereotypes and low self-efficacy
   beliefs may affect students' future career plans.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to: (a) understand practicing teachers' knowledge of
   model functions and modeling processes, (b) compare the similarities and
   differences between the knowledge of science and non-science major
   teachers, and (c) explore the possible reasons for the similarities and
   differences between the knowledge of these 2 groups. A 4-point Likert
   scale questionnaire was developed and used to measure the knowledge of
   187 practicing elementary school teachers (94 science majors and 93
   non-science majors) on model functions and modeling processes. The
   author selected 10 target teachers to conduct think-aloud interview and
   to explore their ranking. One month after completing the questionnaire,
   28 volunteer teachers were selected for a follow-up interview to better
   understand the reasons for their responses. The results show that these
   teachers tend to agree or strongly agree with the items about model
   functions and modeling processes. The only significant difference
   between science and non-science majors was for the item ``generating new
   ideas.{''} Qualitative analyses of the follow-up interviews and
   think-aloud results showed that teacher education and professional
   development did not focus on understanding and using models.
   Science-major teachers tended to formulate their responses with
   reference to specific models, while the non-science major teachers'
   responses contained acquiescence bias. Finally, implications for science
   education are discussed.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated (a) whether the perceived cognitive load
   was different when geometry problems with various levels of
   configuration comprehension were solved and (b) whether eye movements in
   comprehending geometry problems showed sources of cognitive loads. In
   the first investigation, three characteristics of geometry
   configurations involving the number of informational elements, the
   number of element interactivities and the level of mental operations
   were assumed to account for the increasing difficulty. A sample of 311
   9th grade students solved five geometry problems that required knowledge
   of similar triangles in a computer-supported environment. In the second
   experiment, 63 participants solved the same problems and eye movements
   were recorded. The results indicated that (1) the five problems differed
   in pass rate and in self-reported cognitive load; (2) because the
   successful solvers were very swift in pattern recognition and visual
   integration, their fixation did not clearly show valuable information;
   (3) more attention and more time (shown by the heat maps, dwell time and
   fixation counts) were given to read the more difficult configurations
   than to the intermediate or easier configurations; and (4) in addition
   to number of elements and element interactivities, the level of mental
   operations accounts for the major cognitive load sources of
   configuration comprehension. The results derived some implications for
   design principles of geometry diagrams in secondary school mathematics
   textbooks.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effect of the translation of traditional
   scientific vocabulary into plain English on student achievement in
   college science instruction. The study took place in the context of an
   introductory microbiology course. Data were collected from course
   sections instructed with traditional microbiology vocabulary as well as
   sections instructed with plain-English equivalent terms. Both treatment
   groups followed the same inquiry-based curriculum. Data collected
   included written and practical exam scores as well as pre and
   post-course surveys on subject knowledge and impressions of biology,
   science, and the course. Students subjected to plain-English instruction
   performed significantly better on written exams that assessed
   higher-order abilities to apply and analyze knowledge from the course.
   They gained similar amounts of lower-order knowledge during the course
   when compared to peers instructed with standard vocabulary. Results
   supported the hypothesis that improved achievement in the plain-English
   treatment was caused by students' ability to utilize extant neural
   networks to ground new learning.},

Abstract = {Environmental free-choice learning is a strategy that has been shown to
   have positive short-term impacts upon participants' attitudes and
   understanding of desired educational outcomes. However, longitudinal
   studies in this area are rare due to difficulties inherent in data
   collection and vast differences in participants in these kinds of
   educational experiences. This study examined the effectiveness of
   participation in the Skunk River Navy, a free-choice environmental
   education experience, 1 - 4 years afterward to determine longitudinal
   effects of the experience on participants' attitudes toward waterways
   and content knowledge. Importantly, participants were compared to
   non-participants who were also biology majors in the same program,
   completed the same coursework, and who likely shared similar
   dispositions, interest in biology, and are of similar demographic
   backgrounds. Results indicate that attitudes toward waterways and
   content knowledge were higher among participants, but that content
   knowledge remains lower than desired by program developers. Therefore,
   when reducing the impact of selection and variance within the study
   population, longitudinal positive effects can be seen from free-choice
   learning experiences when they are coupled with formal classroom
   experiences that address similar concepts.},

Abstract = {This study diagnosed the understanding about energy and
   biological-context energy concepts held by 90 first-year South African
   university biology students. In particular, students' explanations of
   energy in a biological context, how energy is involved in different
   biological situations and whether energy is present and what types of
   energy are involved in diagrams depicting biological phenomena were
   investigated. The pencil-and-paper diagnostic test, specifically
   designed for this study, was used to elicit students' understanding
   using test items involving biological phenomena. The results showed that
   many students had problems in understanding energy and energy-related
   concepts in the following areas: First, the majority of the students
   provided definitions of energy rather than the explanations they were
   asked to provide, and the definition could have been rote-learned.
   Second, although nearly all students knew the energy conservation
   principle (energy cannot be created or destroyed), many of them were
   unable to apply this concept to biological contexts. Third, many
   students erroneously claimed that the energy for metabolism and life
   processes is made available during photosynthesis in plants, during
   digestion in animals or that this energy comes directly from the sun.
   Fourth, about two thirds of the students erroneously indicated that
   there is no energy involved/present in inanimate objects such as a
   statue. The implications for the teaching and learning of energy and its
   related concepts and recommendations for further research are discussed.},

Abstract = {We report on the work of 3 schools which set out to make a difference
   for their previously low-attaining students. Through naturalistic
   enquiry over 3 years, we built a picture of their practices. Against a
   national trend, students reported positive attitudes to mathematics and,
   in 2 out of 3 schools, showed improvement in attainment, so we probe
   more deeply into the teaching. The lessons broadly conformed to an
   approach combining inclusive participation with complex and coherent
   development of mathematical ideas. To understand how the teachers
   orchestrated this, we developed lesson analysis techniques that focus on
   how thinking, repertoire and understanding are scaffolded by teachers
   through sequences of microtasks.},

Abstract = {We report on a case study that took place in a southwestern culturally
   and linguistically diverse urban high school science classroom during a
   grade recovery summer session. The introduction of a technology-infused
   unit on epidemiology engaged students in a multi-contextual exploration
   of the spread of diseases. The analysis of the resultant classroom
   discourse centers on connections made and identities expressed by the
   students (as students, social beings, avatars, and scientists), with
   particular attention to how these students use language to bridge worlds
   (the participatory simulation world, the classroom world, the `real'
   world (outside the classroom), and the laboratory (science) world). The
   results indicate that including a participatory technology tool
   supported students' learning journey. Specifically, students built on a
   shared virtual experience in ways that helped them to draw and expand on
   prior experiences well beyond the classroom in the service of developing
   science understanding.},

Abstract = {Instruments for evaluating the implementation of inquiry science in K-12
   classrooms are necessary if evaluators and researchers are to know the
   extent to which programs are implemented as intended and the extent to
   which inquiry science teaching accounts for student learning. For
   evaluators and researchers to be confident about the quality of these
   instruments, information about their development and
   validation-particularly about teacher self-report instruments-must be
   available. In this article, we present the Inquiry Science
   Implementation Scale, describe the instrument's development and the
   results of analyses of the validity and reliability of data collected
   with it, and discuss the possible uses of the instrument.},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {A survey instrument was developed and administered to 1,222 K-12
   mathematics and science teachers to measure their beliefs about and use
   of inquiry in the classroom. Four variables (grade level taught, content
   area taught, level of support received, and self-efficacy for teaching
   inquiry) were significantly correlated to two dependent variables,
   percentage of time that students are engaged in inquiry during a typical
   lesson and the perceived ideal percentage of instructional time that
   should be devoted to inquiry. Specifically, elementary school teachers
   reported using inquiry-based practices more than either middle-school or
   high-school teachers; similarly, elementary-school teachers believed
   such practices should be used more often. All groups, however, reported
   believing in an ideal percentage of time devoted to inquiry instruction
   that was significantly greater than their reported percentage of time
   actually spent on inquiry instruction. A disordinal effect was found
   between grade level taught and content area taught; at the elementary
   level, science teachers reported both an ideal and actual percentage of
   time on inquiry higher than those reported by the math teachers, while
   at the high school level math teachers reported both an ideal and actual
   percentage of time on inquiry higher than those reported by the science
   teachers. No correlations were found between typical and ideal
   percentage of time devoted to inquiry and subject matter content
   knowledge training, gender, years of teaching experience, or maximum
   degree earned.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Month = {2024 FEB 21},
Abstract = {Learning science requires students to conceptualize complex scientific
   concepts, discover scientific facts, and share ideas with others. In
   this process, scientific vocabulary and language of science help
   students develop their understanding of science. Given the interlink
   between language and conceptual development, the current study aimed to
   improve seventh-grade students' scientific vocabulary and communicative
   interactions using teaching materials designed for the ``cell and
   divisions{''} subject. Through an embedded mixed research design, the
   study was conducted with 31 (21 girls, 10 boys) students (aged 13-14
   years) drawn from a middle school in the city of Trabzon, Turkiye. A
   scientific vocabulary test, observation form, and video recordings were
   used to collect data. The findings showed significant improvements in
   students' scientific vocabulary and communicative interactions. Future
   studies should examine the effect of students' scientific vocabulary on
   communicative development.},

Title = {The Inclusion of Nature of Science in South African Life Sciences and
   Physical Sciences School Curricula},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Curriculum reform worldwide has often reflected changing perspectives on
   the teaching and learning of science. Such perspectives underline the
   notion that not only the teaching of science content knowledge is
   relevant but also the aims and methods scientists use to further their
   knowledge and the social context in which science is applied. We call
   this the `cognitive-epistemic' and `social institutional aspects' of
   science. They form the hard core of the nature of science (NOS) concept
   for curriculum reform. In South Africa, after years of Apartheid, a key
   focus of school science curriculum reform is for importance to be given
   to NOS due to the potential benefits of learning and understanding of
   NOS for students. This study analyses cognitive-epistemic and
   social-institutional categories of NOS in the South African Life
   Sciences and Physical Sciences school curricula. A critical finding for
   both Life Sciences and Physical Sciences curricula was the imbalance in
   the NOS categories. In the curricula, there is less presence of the
   social-institutional categories compared to the cognitive-epistemic
   categories. In general, there was poor interconnectedness amongst NOS
   categories, with the strongest interconnectedness revealed for the
   cognitive-epistemic categories `scientific practices' and `methods and
   methodological rules'. Implications for the design of future curricula
   and recommendations for future research are discussed.},

Title = {Prospective Teachers' Reflections on the Inclusion of Mathematical
   Modelling During the Transition Period Between the Face-to-Face and
   Virtual Teaching Contexts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Research in mathematics education highlights the importance of including
   modelling for the teaching of this subject. In 2020, this trend
   coexisted with a grave contingency situation caused by the COVID-19
   pandemic but which, despite its negative aspects, provided a realistic
   and authentic context for modelling. Given this situation, it is
   relevant to study which aspects of the teaching and learning process
   prospective teachers related to mathematical modelling in their
   reflections on its inclusion during the transition period between the
   face-to-face and virtual teaching contexts. To this end, we used the
   didactic suitability criteria construct, proposed by the onto-semiotic
   approach, as a theoretical reference. This is qualitative research of a
   naturalistic type, since we did not interfere in the Master's Programme
   in Mathematics Teacher Education studied. We conducted a content
   analysis on 122 master's degree final projects written during the
   2019-2020 course and implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
   highlight the following results: (a) about 40\% of the prospective
   teachers stated that they implemented modelling in their didactic units
   and reflected on its inclusion; (b) in their reflections, the
   prospective teachers positively assessed the inclusion of modelling
   mainly based on the epistemic, affective and ecological suitability
   criteria; and (c) 60\% of the prospective teachers did not implement
   modelling, and we rule out that it was due to a lack of knowledge about
   this process or of a favourable context for modelling, but because they
   prioritised other aspects of the mathematical teaching and learning
   process, given the grave contingency situation.},

Abstract = {Teachers lack effective curriculum-based instruments to assess their
   students' scientific competence that would provide information for
   modifying their inquiry instruction. The main purpose of this study was
   to develop and validate a Curriculum-Based Scientific Competence (CBSC)
   test to assess students' scientific competence in a 1-semester Grade 9
   curriculum. The initial 51-item CBSC test was administered to 318 Grade
   10 students from 4 schools. The Rasch partial credit model was used to
   analyse the quality of the CBSC test. The final 44-item CBSC test
   demonstrated satisfactory item fit, threshold, and test reliability.
   Further, a 23-item PISA test was used to measure criterion validity.
   Results indicated that the CBSC test was valid for assessing students'
   scientific competencies and can distinguish the effect of inquiry
   instruction from that of traditional instruction. A CBSC test would
   provide teachers the summative assessment of scientific competency for
   examining the effect of inquiry-based teaching. The model of development
   and validation of the CBSC test through the cooperation of teachers and
   researchers for each semester of a science programme is recommended.},

Abstract = {The most famous equation in physics, E = mc(2), is rarely introduced in
   middle school physics curricula. Recent research has shown that teaching
   Einsteinian concepts at the middle school level is feasible and
   beneficial. This paper analyses an Einsteinian energy teaching module
   for Year 8 students (13-14 years old), which encompasses the two
   fundamental energy formulas in modern physics, E = mc(2) and E = hf. In
   the context of activity-based learning, the Einsteinian energy module
   relates to all the forms of energy in traditional school curricula. This
   study uses a design-based research approach within the Model of
   Educational Reconstruction framework. Modern experiments, historical
   events, and educational research helped us identify relevant Einsteinian
   energy concepts, activities, and assessments. The study included 22
   students who participated in nine in-class Einsteinian energy lessons.
   Analysing results in the post-test showed a 31\% mean increase from the
   pre-test, a clear and significant positive change in students'
   conceptual understanding. The results demonstrated students' ability to
   deal with very large and small constants of proportionality and physical
   concepts involved in the module.},

Abstract = {Research into didactics of calculus has maintained a long-standing
   interest in students' grasp of the relations between definite integrals
   and areas. This study comes to contribute to this line of research by
   unpacking how students use the concept of area to find definite
   integrals. Specifically, we focus on mathematical situations where the
   integral functions are represented graphically and change signs between
   the limits of integration. We conceptualize these situations through the
   lens of Fischbein's theories of mental models and contemporary modelling
   literature. This lens is applied to authentic data corpus collected in a
   large first-year mathematics course-video-recordings of solutions that
   students submitted as part of their coursework and students' responses
   in multiple-choice final exams. The analysis revealed two modelling
   paths that students' solutions followed: one based on areas that the
   function enclosed, and one based on the integrals of the assigned
   functions. While the key role of areas in the first path could be
   expected, area-based reasoning in the second path is noteworthy. In the
   exams, just above one-fifth of students' responses were consistent with
   adding the positive measures of the enclosed areas. We situate these
   findings in the calculus literature to draw educators' attention to
   silent challenges that are inherent in the integral-area relations.},

Abstract = {The literature has amply shown that primary and secondary school
   students have difficulties in understanding rational number size. Many
   of these difficulties are explained by the natural number bias or the
   use of other incorrect reasoning such as gap thinking. However, in many
   studies, these types of reasoning have been inferred from comparing
   students' accuracies in multiple-choice items. Evidence that supports
   that these incorrect ways of reasoning are indeed underlying is scarce.
   In the present work, we carried out interviews with 52 seventh grade
   students. The objective was to validate the existence of students'
   incorrect ways of thinking about fraction size that were previously
   inferred from patterns of correct and incorrect answers to
   multiple-choice items, by looking at students' verbalizations, and
   examine whether these ways of thinking are resistant to change.
   Students' verbalizations support the existence of the different
   incorrect ways of thinking inferred from previous studies in fraction
   size. Furthermore, the high levels of confidence in their incorrect
   reasoning and the fact that they were reluctant to change their answer
   when they were confronted with other reasoning suggest that these ways
   of thinking may be resistant to change.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between
   emotions and development of scientific understanding by examining (1)
   how students perform in scientific sensemaking in the context of a
   three-cycle predict-observe-explain (POE) activity, (2) what kind of
   trajectories of situational epistemic emotions students show when making
   sense of the phenomenon, and (3) how students' performance in
   sensemaking is related to their emotional trajectories. Data from 109
   participant students were collected in six upper secondary physics
   classes. Students' performance in sensemaking was evaluated based on
   their answers on POE items and categorised through qualitative content
   analysis. Situational epistemic emotions (surprise, curiosity,
   confusion, and boredom) were measured using a four-point Likert scale
   after each POE cycle. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify
   groups of students with distinctive emotional trajectories. The
   relationship between the performance in POE activity and emotional
   trajectories was explored by a chi-square test. The results indicate
   that students' inability to make relevant observations is significantly
   related to experienced boredom. Furthermore, students who perform better
   in making sense of the phenomenon are more likely to experience
   surprise, curiosity, and confusion. This implies that engaging students
   to be curious when they observe and test predictions is an important
   mission for curriculum designers and teachers in practice. The findings
   underline the importance of epistemic emotions in educational settings
   and the complexity of the interplay between cognitive and affective
   factors in learning situations.},

Abstract = {Mental brackets constitute an idiosyncratic use of brackets sometimes
   used to evaluate arithmetic expressions and are closely connected with
   students' structure sense. The relevant literature describes the use of
   mental brackets focusing on primary school students and in the context
   of arithmetic. Using 181 high school students' solutions to seven tasks,
   this paper attempts to broaden the scope of mental brackets. It
   investigates high school students' mental brackets use and their
   presence in different mathematical domains. The findings show that high
   school students use mental brackets in the context of arithmetic while
   evaluating arithmetic expressions, and in the context of algebra, mainly
   when substituting numerical values in the variables. Moreover, the
   analysis provides further insights into the use of mental brackets.
   Sometimes they are applied to the whole expression (global mental
   brackets) and other times just to parts of it (local mental brackets).},

Title = {History of Science Reading Materials as Everyday Homework to Improve
   Middle School Students' Epistemological Beliefs about Science},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The history of science (HOS) has played an important role in science
   curricula for teaching about science. However, historical information in
   science textbooks is often de-contextualized, coupled with limited class
   time and teaching barriers, and thus fails to help students understand
   the dynamic process of scientific development. This research effort was
   then directed to design nontextbook, supplemental reading materials that
   include scientific historical vignettes and guiding questions to elicit
   views about nature of science (NOS). The homework notebook was designed
   as a carrier to provide students after-school learning opportunities
   with the HOS-NOS approach. In the large-scale implementation study, 18
   middle school homeroom teachers voluntarily adopted the designed
   HOS-based notebook for the regular purpose of homework recording and
   teacher-parent communication over a semester. They were interviewed
   about homework policies. Their students' scientific epistemological
   beliefs and individual interests in science and reading were assessed at
   the beginning and end of the semester to evaluate the effectiveness of
   the notebook. Quantitative results indicated that these 7th and 8th
   grade students had significant improvements in epistemic understandings
   of the source and the (un)certainty of scientific knowledge after using
   this notebook. Students' individual interest in science and reading was
   interrelated with their epistemic views about the evolving nature of
   science and justification methods in science. Further explorations on
   the quality of students' reflective writings in the notebook suggested
   that students' reading experiences were affected by the homework
   policies and writing requirements their homeroom teachers adopted. This
   research provides implications on the design of reading materials for
   improving students' scientific literacy.},

Abstract = {Using a cluster randomized trial, we investigated the effects of
   mathematics professional development on student achievement in
   elementary schools. Pairs of schools were matched on prior mathematics;
   percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch and
   percentage of limited English proficient students were randomly assigned
   to two groups. One received professional development on mathematics that
   focuses on diagnosing student thinking and the other received
   professional development on formative assessment. Student-level
   achievement data (pretest and posttest performance on a standardized
   test of mathematics) were nested within grades and schools and analyzed
   using mixed-effects multi-level linear modeling. The results indicate
   students in schools that were provided the mathematics professional
   development had greater mathematics achievement than students in schools
   in a control condition. The effect held across grade levels.},

Abstract = {In the rush to implement STEM programmes in economically disadvantaged
   school districts, there is a pressing need to develop a stronger sense
   of what might be considered effective and appropriate STEM practices for
   diverse students. The aim of this study was to characterise the
   experience of implementing an integrated STEM Project-Based Learning
   (PBL) programme in an Australian secondary school located within a
   diverse, socio-economically disadvantaged community. To identify
   enablers and constraints in delivering STEM PBL in this context, the
   study utilised qualitative data from interviews with school teachers and
   leaders, school planning documents and an extended series of classroom
   observations. Key findings point towards the importance of building a
   school culture that supports innovative pedagogy; the need to
   purposefully scaffold the capabilities of teachers and students to
   engage with active learning; and the potential value of
   multi-dimensional assessment allowing students to demonstrate STEM
   proficiency through novel forms of evidence.},

Abstract = {This study examined preservice mathematics teachers' selective attention
   and knowledge-based reasoning as they viewed a statistics lesson video.
   Analysis for this study was based on preservice teachers' written
   explanations for noteworthy moments they identified when watching the
   video. Findings indicated that, with regard to the preservice teachers'
   selective attention, they attended more to the teacher's pedagogy in the
   video than to students and students' statistical thinking. Analysis of
   the preservice teachers' knowledge-based reasoning revealed that they
   were more likely to use an interpretive stance than a descriptive or an
   evaluate stance to reason about what they observed. The preservice
   teachers, however, were less likely to draw on their statistical
   knowledge needed for teaching to reason about students' statistical
   thinking. Rather, the preservice teachers' noticing was informed by
   their general pedagogical knowledge or knowledge that was unrelated to
   statistical thinking. The current study suggests that professional
   knowledge for teaching in a particular domain should be incorporated
   into the examination of teacher noticing in order to better understand
   the ways in which teachers notice.},

Abstract = {The Community of Practice framework has been used theoretically and
   empirically to describe the diverse ways people learn from one another
   through social interaction in a variety of specific contexts. To date,
   most research of this genre has favored investigating the community and
   domain constructs of the theory over the authentic practice construct.
   Those interested in recognizing and supporting science learning in
   non-school contexts across a lifespan are then limited in efforts to
   delineate how communities engage in domain-specific practice. This is
   especially relevant in the study of online environments which afford
   more democratic forms of participation. With the goal of adding to both
   theoretical and practical knowledge, this study explored practices that
   members enacted on a community-based website specific to the domain of
   paleontology. We used a multiple case study approach to provide
   comparative and contrasting narratives concerning the development of
   practice within an online, scientific community. Methods consisted of
   downloading data from the website, including members' self-described
   attributes within member profiles, followed by their contributions to
   three of the website's features: the forums, activity feed, and
   messages. An analytical framework which typified members based on their
   self-described attributes was applied, then members' contributions were
   coded using an empirically based Communities of Practice framework. For
   one of the first times, we identified practice within an online,
   scientific community through comparing the contributions of three
   community members, finding that practice consisted of providing social
   support to other community members and having domain-based
   conversations.},

Abstract = {Understanding the development of mathematics self-efficacy has important
   implications. Based on Bandura's four sources of self-efficacy, most
   previous studies mainly examined whether the sources predicted or
   correlated with mathematics self-efficacy, which might have
   oversimplified the underlying mechanism of self-efficacy development.
   This study conducted an in-depth investigation into the sources of
   mathematics self-efficacy of Chinese junior high school students. A
   mixed-method approach was adopted, which incorporated semi-structured
   interview with the ``Q-sorting{''} procedure. Twelve Chinese students (6
   boys and 6 girls, mean age 13.2 years) were purposely selected based on
   gender and their mathematics self-efficacy levels. Findings showed that
   students with either high or low self-efficacy not only experienced
   different degrees of exposure to the sources of self-efficacy but also
   held diverse viewpoints about the effects of each source on their
   mathematics self-efficacy. Girls recalled receiving more social
   persuasion and experiencing more anxiety than boys in mathematics
   learning. Yet, girls' perceptions of the influence of each source were
   not significantly different from boys'. In contrast to previous studies
   conducted in western contexts, this study demonstrates Chinese students'
   different viewpoints about the influence of effort, competition and face
   issue on their mathematics self-efficacy. Findings of this study shed
   light on the complex mechanism underlying the development of
   self-efficacy in mathematics learning.},

Abstract = {In this research, we investigate the concerns regarding a national
   mathematics curricular reform of a cohort of student teachers over the
   course of their 2-year postgraduate initial teacher education (ITE)
   programme. The concerns of 41 student teachers from four third-level
   institutions in Ireland were initially recorded at the commencement of
   their ITE programme. A qualitative study examining the evolution of
   these concerns for 12 student teachers was undertaken over three
   different stages of the 2-year programme. Qualitative responses were
   generated and analysed according to their stages of concerns. Findings
   suggest that, at the commencement of their ITE programme, student
   teachers displayed few informational concerns yet they possessed several
   incorrect assumptions regarding the intention of the reform. Over time,
   these concerns evolved towards their capabilities to implement the
   curriculum in classrooms and consequences of the reform on student
   learning. At the end of their ITE programme, many expressed concerns
   about implementing reform practices when they become newly qualified
   teachers.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we will examine the mathematical knowledge that
   prospective mathematics teachers draw upon when graphing function graphs
   and curves, with a special focus on the occurrence of asymptotes. Three
   tasks which involved a graph of a rational and exponential function and
   a hyperbola as a conic section were designed and administered to
   students. We performed this study within the framework of
   Anthropological Theory of the Didactic to examine the relationship of
   prospective mathematics teachers' available knowledge with the knowledge
   to be taught in upper secondary schools and scholarly knowledge relevant
   for teaching. By studying prospective mathematics teachers' knowledge,
   we aim to understand the feasibility of our proposed reference
   epistemological model for graphing functions and curves in the upper
   secondary school. Our findings reveal students' shortcomings with
   respect to the choice of the appropriate graphing praxeology for given
   tasks. Students' graphing strategies relied mostly on plotting points
   obtained by evaluating a formula, which is a dominant approach in the
   textbooks we analysed. Plotting points did not lead students to examine
   asymptotic behaviour, along with the observed monotonicity of a
   function. Their graphing strategies were found to be predominantly
   dependent on the particular setting in which the task was presented.
   Additionally, in our study, the idea of an asymptote as a tangent line
   at infinity in the geometric setting was questioned.},

Abstract = {The issue of early algebraic thinking is of great importance for the
   school life of young students. In this paper, the Father Woodland, a
   puzzle-like environment, is presented aiming to facilitate the use of
   algebraic thinking in early schooling. Seventy grade 3 students
   participated and their work was examined within Radford's (2011, 2014)
   framework for algebraic thinking. The findings show that the students
   were able to refer to the unknowns of the problems, to use a broad range
   of (not necessarily alphanumeric) symbolization and act upon the
   indeterminate quantities as if they were known numbers.},

Abstract = {We recognise that though teachers may participate in various forms of
   professional development (PD) programmes, learning that they may have
   gained in the PD may not always lead to corresponding perceivable
   changes in their classroom teaching. We offer a theoretical
   re-orientation towards this issue by introducing a construct we term
   concretisation. Concretisations are resources developed in PD settings
   which can be converted into tangible tools for classroom use. In
   theorising such resources, we contribute in informing the design process
   of teacher professional development for better impact into actual
   classroom practice. We purport principles of design which render
   concretisations effective. Subsequently, we test these principles by
   presenting a specific case of teaching mathematical problem solving.},

Abstract = {To what degree can multilingual students profit from bilingual teaching
   approaches, even when they lack experience in the academic or technical
   register in their home languages? This study explores this research
   question in a mixed methods design for a German/Turkish bilingual
   intervention aimed at fostering conceptual understanding of fractions
   (five sessions of 90min each). The sample consisted of German/Turkish
   bilingual students (n=128) in Grade 7 in German schools without prior
   formal mathematics education in Turkish. In a randomized control trial,
   the bilingual intervention was compared to the corresponding monolingual
   intervention and a control group. A repeated analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) showed that students in both interventions had significantly
   higher learning gains than in the control group, and in fact profited
   equally from both interventions, although some time and effort was
   required for overcoming initial barriers in the home language and
   especially in the academic register. A qualitative analysis of the
   videotaped bilingual learning processes revealed insights into specific
   obstacles and chances of connecting both languages in order to foster
   conceptual understanding. The students with some formal language
   proficiency in Turkish seemed to profit even more from the bilingual
   intervention, but a rigid technical register was not necessary.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present the results of the administration of a
   questionnaire designed to evaluate the understanding that civil
   engineering students have of the antiderivative. The questionnaire was
   simultaneously administered to samples of Mexican and Colombian
   students. For the analysis of the answers, we used some theoretical and
   methodological notions provided by the theoretical model known as
   Onto-Semiotic Approach (OSA) to mathematical cognition and instruction.
   The results revealed the meanings of the antiderivative that are more
   predominantly used by civil engineering students. Also, the comparison
   between the mathematical activity of Mexican and Colombian students
   provides information that allows concluding that the meanings mobilized
   could be shared among their communities and are not particular of their
   classroom or university.},

Title = {Knowledge-Integration Processes and Learning Outcomes Associated with a
   Self-Diagnosis Activity: the Case of 5th-Graders Studying Simple
   Fractions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {929-948},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {I examined how well a self-diagnosis activity engages students in
   knowledge-integration processes, and its impact on students'
   mathematical achievements. The self-diagnosis activity requires students
   to self-diagnose their solutions to problems that they have solved on
   their own-namely, to identify where they went wrong and to explain the
   nature of their own errors-and self-score them, aided by a rubric
   demonstrating how to solve each problem step by step. I also examined
   knowledge-integration processes and the impact on students' achievements
   in a traditional activity in which teachers solve, together with their
   students, problems that students have solved on their own. The two
   activities can provide students with opportunities to reflect on their
   own errors, which is assumed to promote learning. Two 5th-grade classes
   studying simple fractions with the same teacher participated. A
   pre-test/intervention/post-test design was employed. In the
   intervention, one class was assigned to the self-diagnosis activity and
   the other to the traditional activity. Results suggested that at least
   for a teacher who is not competent in managing argumentative class
   discussions, the self-diagnosis activity is more effective than the
   traditional activity in engaging students in knowledge-integration
   processes and enhancing their achievements. I account for these results
   and suggest possible directions for future research.},

Title = {Validation of an Instrument for Measuring Students' Understanding of

Abstract = {So far, not enough effort has been invested in developing reliable,
   valid, and engaging assessments in school science, especially assessment
   of interdisciplinary science based on the new Next Generation Science
   Standards (NGSS). Furthermore, previous tools rely mostly on
   multiple-choice items and evaluation of student outcome is linked only
   to their raw scores in standardized tests. In addition, educational
   research on student science achievement always limits in certain
   grade/subject according to application of raw scores. This study
   provides a way to design, validate, and further improve an instrument to
   assess student understanding in interdisciplinary science across grade
   and time. Meanwhile, student learning growth is investigated. The data
   are collected from elementary/middle school student survey from an
   Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Partnership (ISEP) in
   Northeastern part of the USA. The results show a generally good quality
   of instrument through various aspects of empirical evidence, such as
   dimensionality, model-data-fit, and validity. Finally, student learning
   growth in understanding interdisciplinary science shows a sharp increase
   between elementary and middle school. The study sheds light on
   developing more reliable and valid instruments in assessing student
   science understanding based on the new standards and it also provides
   suggestions of implementation in both educational research and practice.},

Abstract = {This case study explores young children's understanding and application
   of the concept of volume through the practices of engineering design in
   a STEM activity. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics. However, engineering stands out as a challenging area to
   implement. In addition, most early engineering education research
   centers on curriculum and instruction rather than students'
   understanding and application of models and content knowledge to a
   design project (Johri and Olds, Journal of Engineering Education,
   100(1):151-185, 2011). For this study, we created a play-based STEM
   activity which helps students understand and apply the concept of volume
   in creating clay boats through the practices of engineering design.
   Three students voluntarily participated in this study. Data sources
   included interviews, photocopies of boats, and observation field notes
   which were analyzed using a comprehensive cross-case analysis. Findings
   indicate that the common pattern is rather intuitive when students
   define engineering problems using different criteria. Also, students'
   solutions to engineering problems are associated with their experiential
   ideas of reality. How students express their understanding of volume is
   correlated to the way of their structuring volume. Lastly, students
   understand the concept of volume gradually while going through the
   practices of engineering design. Implications are discussed in terms of
   how engineering education contributes to students' understanding of
   volume.},

Abstract = {Beliefs and problem solving are connected and have been studied in
   different contexts. One of the common results of previous research is
   that students tend to prefer algorithmic approaches to mathematical
   tasks. This study explores Swedish upper secondary school students'
   beliefs and reasoning when solving non-routine tasks. The results
   regarding the beliefs indicated by the students were found deductively
   and include expectations, motivational beliefs and security. When it
   comes to reasoning, a variety of approaches were found. Even though the
   tasks were designed to demand more than imitation of algorithms,
   students used this method and failed to solve the task.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the covariational reasoning abilities of
   prospective middle school mathematics teachers in a task about dynamic
   functional events involving two simultaneously changing quantities in an
   individual process and also in a peer interaction process. The focus was
   the ways in which prospective teachers' covariational reasoning
   abilities re-emerge in the peer interaction process in excess of their
   covariational reasoning. The data sources were taken from the individual
   written responses of prospective teachers, transcripts of individual
   comments, and transcripts of conversations in pairs. The data were
   analyzed for prospective teachers in terms of the cognitive and
   interactive aspects of individual behavior and also interaction. The
   findings revealed that prospective teachers at different levels working
   in pairs benefited from the process in terms of developing an awareness
   of their own individual and also a pair's understanding of covarying
   quantities. Furthermore, the prospective teachers had opportunities to
   develop their knowledge on the connection between variables, rate of
   change, and slope. The prospective teachers' work in pairs provided
   salient explanations for their reasoning about the task superior to
   their individual responses.},

Abstract = {Math anxiety impedes performance in simple arithmetic tasks. Anxiety
   constrains working memory capacity and particularly the attentional
   functions of the central executive. The experiment reported here
   explored how interactivity mitigated the impact of math anxiety on the
   performance of elementary school students with simple additions. It
   manipulated two independent variables. The first was the length of the
   additions-involving either 7 or 11 number tokens (the value of the
   tokens ranged from 1 to 20). The other was the level of interactivity:
   in the low interactivity condition participants could not touch or point
   to the number tokens that configured the sums, and in a high
   interactivity condition participants could manipulate the tokens as they
   saw fit in deriving their answer. The length of the addition had an
   impact on accuracy, with longer sums leading to poorer performance.
   However, overall, performance in the high interactivity condition was
   superior, in terms of accuracy, absolute calculation error and
   efficiency, than performance in the low interactivity condition.
   Mathematics anxiety significantly predicted performance in the low
   interactivity condition, but not in the high interactivity condition.
   These results suggest that working memory resources are augmented
   through interactivity with the physical problem presentation, defusing
   the impact of anxiety on performance.},

Abstract = {Many journal articles detail recommendations to naturally integrate
   literacy instruction into content-area classes, particularly science,
   claiming that such instructional practices will support both literacy
   and content-knowledge acquisition. This begs the question, are the
   literacy strategies recommended for content-area instruction founded in
   established educational theories? The purpose of the current study is to
   examine the implicit and explicit theories driving science disciplinary
   literacy instruction. Theories assist in organizing and advancing
   research in a systematic manner. Information on the status of theory is
   essential to both practitioners (who are implementing strategies) and
   researchers (who are making recommendations for classroom instruction).
   Our study revealed that in science literacy, vocabulary instructional
   practices are frequently supported with Schema and Dual-Coding theories.
   Articles also frequently used theories grounded in social dynamics,
   including social constructionism and sociocultural perspective, to
   support literacy instruction. However, recommendations for other aspects
   of instructional practices in science literacy are generally not
   well-grounded in major reading theories.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of research regarding approaches to the
   origin of life featured in science textbooks produced by an Evangelical
   publisher. The research nature was qualitative with document analysis
   and an interpretive framework based on Epistemological Pluralism.
   Overall, the results indicate that there are four perspectives on the
   origin of life in textbooks under study. These perspectives do not
   distinguish scientific knowledge from religious knowledge but present a
   hybrid of scientific and religious knowledge. There are scientific
   inaccuracies in the perspectives, which emphasize biblical arguments
   over scientific arguments. Data analysis and conclusions take into
   account the central argument of Epistemological Pluralism about the
   importance of demarcation of science in relation to other knowledge
   systems and its consequences for learning science.},

Title = {STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF EQUILIBRIUM AND STABILITY: THE CASE OF

Abstract = {Engineering students in control courses have been observed to lack an
   understanding of equilibrium and stability, both of which are crucial
   concepts in this discipline. The introduction of these concepts is
   generally based on the study of classical examples from Newtonian
   mechanics supplemented with a control system. Equilibrium and stability
   are approached in different ways at the various stages of a typical
   engineering syllabus: at the beginning, they are mostly dealt with a
   static point of view, for example in mechanics, and are subsequently
   handled through dynamic analysis in control courses. In general, there
   is a little clarification of the differences between these concepts or
   the ways in which they are linked. We believe that this leads to much
   confusion and incomprehension among engineering students. Several
   studies have shown that students encounter difficulties when presented
   with simple familiar or academic static equilibrium cases in mechanics.
   Our study investigates students' conceptions and misconceptions about
   equilibrium and stability through a series of questions about several
   innovative non-static situations. It reveals that the understanding of
   these notions is shaken when the systems being studied are placed in
   inertial or non-inertial moving reference frames. The students in our
   study were particularly uncertain about the existence of unstable
   equilibrium positions and had difficulty in differentiating between the
   two concepts. The results suggest that students use a velocity-based
   approach to explain such situations. A poor grasp of the above
   fundamental concepts may result from previous learning experiences. More
   specifically, certain difficulties seem to be directly linked to a lack
   of understanding of these concepts, while others are related to
   misconceptions arising from everyday experiences and the inappropriate
   use of physical examples in primary school.},

Abstract = {Decreasing student interest and achievement during the transition from
   elementary to secondary school is an international problem, especially
   in science education. The question of what factors influence this
   decline has been a widely discussed topic. This study focuses on
   investigating the relationship of elementary school teachers' content
   knowledge (CK) in physics upon the student outcomes of interest and
   achievement. Data were collected from K-4 elementary school teachers (N
   = 58) and their students (N = 1,326). Besides questionnaire surveys of
   teachers and students, one science lesson on the topic ``states of
   matter and phase transitions{''} of each classroom was videotaped for
   assessing teaching quality. Analyses from a triangulation of data could
   not identify an impact of teachers' CK upon students' interest. However,
   the sequencing of learning processes within a lesson was found to be a
   positive predictor for students' achievement, although only minimal time
   was spent on reflective phases during the lessons.},

Abstract = {The concepts of social and sociomathematical norms have proved to be
   useful in guiding the participation of students in mathematical
   discussions and developing the quality of their contributions when
   inquiry-based, collaborative approaches are applied in studying
   mathematics. The first author conducted a teaching experiment with her
   17-year-old upper secondary students. Before teaching the concepts of
   calculus, she asked the students to answer some questions and solve
   problems in small groups. The aim was that the students would construct
   important aspects of the basic concepts by themselves whilst
   investigating and discussing mathematics. In this paper, we report some
   findings from the related ethnographic teacher research by describing
   three sociomathematical norms that were negotiated in the interactions
   of two small groups. Aspects new to the literature were the norm of
   creative investigating and the way the appreciation of symbolic
   representation prohibited the process of meaning construction.
   Furthermore, the sociomathematical norm of justifications being based on
   the properties of mathematical objects was established prior to the
   social norm of justifying.},

Abstract = {Classroom observation research and research on teacher expertise are
   similar in their reliance on observational data with high-inference
   procedure to assess the quality of instruction. Expertise research
   usually uses low-inference measures like eye tracking to identify
   qualitative difference between expert and novice behaviors and
   cognition. In this study, we used mobile eye-tracking technology to
   create a low inference quality indicator for the comparison of
   experienced and student teachers. The distribution of visual fixations
   on students was measured using Gini coefficients based on the
   observation of van den Bogert, van Bruggen, Kostons, and Jochems
   (Teacher and Teacher Education, 37, 208-216, 2014) that expert teachers
   show better classroom monitoring. Results confirm that student teachers
   have a higher Gini coefficient than experienced teachers indicating
   weaker classroom monitoring. However, the Gini coefficient did not
   correlate in the predicted way with trained observer coding of video
   footage of the same classrooms using the Classroom Assessment Scoring
   System (CLASS) (Pianta, Hamre, Haynes, Mintz, \& La Paro, 2007) although
   the mean differences in behavioral management were higher for the
   experienced teachers as expected. The CLASS dimension Quality of
   Feedback was significantly related to the Gini coefficient as an
   interaction with expertise: Only for novice teachers that a high quality
   of feedback was negatively associated with monitoring of the classroom.},

Abstract = {In this study, our basic contention was that it is essential for
   researchers to answer the question, ``Where does cognitive conflict
   really arise from?{''} with more precision than has heretofore been
   attempted. First, we examined how the term ``cognitive conflict{''} has
   been treated in the existing literature and try to pinpoint some
   difficulties, related to inexplicitness or imprecision. Second, we
   investigated the students' resources that cause cognitive conflict in
   learning gravitational potential energy. Finally, we illustrated the
   structure of creating cognitive conflict by using a framework of
   knowledge and belief, and we explained how students locate their
   resources, interact with those resources, and so create cognitive
   conflict. We also discuss how identifying the structure of creating
   cognitive conflict helps us understand and address the issue of
   students' cognitive conflicts.},

Abstract = {Achievement in mathematics is inextricably linked to future career
   opportunities, and therefore, understanding those factors that influence
   achievement is important. This study sought to examine the relationships
   among attitude towards mathematics, ability and mathematical
   achievement. This examination was also supported by a focus on gender
   effects. By drawing on a sample of Australian secondary school students,
   it was demonstrated through the results of a multivariate analysis of
   variance that females were more likely to hold positive attitudes
   towards mathematics. In addition, the predictive capacity of prior
   achievement and attitudes towards mathematics on a nationally recognised
   secondary school mathematics examination was shown to be large (R-2 =
   0.692). However, when these predictors were controlled, the influence of
   gender was non-significant. Moreover, a structural equation model was
   developed from the same measures and subsequent testing indicated that
   the model offered a reasonable fit of the data. The positing and testing
   of this model signifies growth in the Australian research literature by
   showing the contribution that ability (as measured by standardised test
   results in numeracy and literacy) and attitude towards mathematics play
   in explaining mathematical achievement in secondary school. The
   implications of these results for teachers, parents and other
   researchers are then considered.},

Title = {CHILDREN'S GESTURES AND THE EMBODIED KNOWLEDGE OF GEOMETRY},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {There is mounting research evidence that contests the metaphysical
   perspective of knowing as mental process detached from the physical
   world. Yet education, especially in its teaching and learning practices,
   continues to treat knowledge as something that is necessarily and solely
   expressed in ideal verbal form. This study is part of a funded project
   that investigates the role of the body in knowing and learning
   mathematics. Based on a 3-week (15 1-h lessons) video study of 1-s grade
   mathematics classroom (N = 24), we identify 4 claims: (a) gestures
   support children's thinking and knowing, (b) gestures co-emerge with
   peers' gestures in interactive situations, (c) gestures cope with the
   abstractness of concepts, and (d) children's bodies exhibit geometrical
   knowledge. We conclude that children think and learn through their
   bodies. Our study suggests to educators that conventional images of
   knowledge as being static and abstract in nature need to be rethought so
   that it not only takes into account verbal and written languages and
   text but also recognizes the necessary ways in which children's
   knowledge is embodied in and expressed through their bodies.},

Abstract = {This study examined the differential impacts of an inquiry-based
   instruction on conceptual changes across levels of prior knowledge and
   reading ability. The instrument emphasized four simultaneously important
   components: conceptual knowledge, reading ability, attitude toward
   science, and learning environment. Although the learning patterns and
   effect size analyses indicated that students from all subgroups
   demonstrated substantial gains on weather concepts, students from the
   low prior conceptual knowledge group demonstrated greater gains in
   conceptual knowledge than subgroups with more prior knowledge; and these
   gains remained stable 3 weeks after the instruction ceased. However,
   students from the low language proficiency group showed the least gains
   in conceptual knowledge. Students' prior knowledge and reading ability
   were found to be positively and significantly associated to conceptual
   development. Recent perspectives on the role of language in science
   education and suggestions that support learning during instruction are
   briefly described.},

Title = {INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN ANALOGY ACTIVITY IN IMPROVING
   STUDENTS' CONCEPTUAL CHANGE FOR SOLUTION CHEMISTRY CONCEPTS},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {651-676},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper reports on an investigation on the use of an analogy activity
   and seeks to provide evidence of whether the activity enables students
   to change alternative conceptions towards views more in accord with
   scientific views for aspects of solution chemistry. We were also
   interested in how robust any change was and whether these changes in
   conceptual thinking became embedded in the students' long-term memory.
   The study has its theoretical basis in an interpretive paradigm, and
   used multiple methods to probe the issues in depth. Data collection
   consisted of two concept test items, one-on-one interviews, and student
   self-assessment. The sample consisted of 44 Grade 9 students selected
   from two intact classes (22 each), from Trabzon, Turkey. The interviews
   were conducted with six students selected because of evidence as to
   their significant conceptual change in solution chemistry. The research
   findings revealed statistically significant differences in pre-test and
   post-test scores, and pre-test and delayed post-test scores (p < 0.05),
   but no differences between post-test and delayed test scores (p > 0.05).
   This suggests that the analogy activity is helpful in enhancing
   students' conceptual understanding of solution chemistry, and that these
   changes may be stored in the students' long-term memory.},

Abstract = {The present work refers to a study of 10-12-year-old students' ideas on
   the self- or hetero-luminosity of the Moon. To check the validity of
   students' reasoning on this question, we also examined their ideas on
   the lunar phases and how we see hetero-luminous objects. Students
   supported their ideas on the self- or hetero-luminosity of the Moon by
   using naive explanatory reasoning, based on alternative ideas about
   various astronomical phenomena. On the other hand, an analysis of the
   students' answers showed that there are qualitative differences between
   the two groups. For students to understand that the Moon is illuminated
   by the Sun, comprehension of the relative movements, relative sizes and
   distances of the Sun-Earth-Moon system is necessary.},

Title = {Low-Attaining Secondary School Mathematics Students' Perspectives on
   Recommended Teaching Strategies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 12},
Abstract = {Recent research syntheses have identified several potentially
   high-leverage teaching strategies for improving low-attaining secondary
   school students' learning of mathematics. These strategies include the
   structured use of representations and manipulatives and an emphasis on
   derived facts and estimation. This paper reports on 70 semi-structured
   interviews conducted with low-attaining students in Years 9-10 (ages
   13-15) in England. The interviews addressed the students' perceptions of
   learning mathematics and the teaching strategies that they experienced
   and believed were most helpful. Many students reported rarely using
   number lines, not spontaneously estimating answers and being unfamiliar
   with derived facts. During the interviews, with minimal direction,
   students often showed that they were well able to make use of these
   strategies; however, they did not report making spontaneous use of them
   independently. We conclude that many of the most well-evidenced and
   recommended strategies to support low-attaining students in mathematics
   appear to be unfamiliar and unvalued, and we discuss how this might be
   addressed.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated mathematics teacher's noticing of
   students' thinking in the context of mathematical modeling activities
   (MEAs) related to statistics. One middle-school mathematics teacher
   participated in the study, which adopted a case study design. Data were
   collected through interviews with the teacher based on video recordings
   of students' group work, the written works of the students, and the
   researchers' observations and field notes. As students evolved from
   first-draft solutions to more powerful, sharable ways of thinking about
   the modeling activity, the teacher focused on student thinking related
   to four distinct aspects of the overall modeling activities:
   understanding the problem, manipulation, interpretation, and
   verification. She mostly focused on procedural aspects of students'
   thinking during the manipulation step. Her attention and interpretation
   of the manipulation step focused on the students' (a) identification of
   the solution (how students reach the solution), (b) reasons why they
   selected these solutions (explanations and justifications of the
   solutions), and (c) features of the solutions they used. The teacher
   also noticed how the students' performances depended on the structure of
   the activity (whether a data set was given). She pointed out that MEAs
   support students' engagement, conceptual understanding, skills related
   to statistics, and ability to use data processing concepts in their
   daily lives.},

Title = {Exploring high school students' disciplinary science identities and

Abstract = {The notion of science identity has been widely discussed in the field of
   science education in recent years. Many research studies have focused on
   students' science identity in a general sense in spite of the fact that
   students are usually exposed to discipline-specific science courses in
   high school. We argue that it is more appropriate to explore high school
   students' disciplinary identities in natural sciences (i.e. physics,
   chemistry and biology). A quantitative approach was used to investigate
   high school students' disciplinary identities among three science
   subjects and explore the effects of these identities on students'
   intentions to major in college science programs. An instrument
   addressing three disciplinary identities was administered to 510
   students from 10 science classes in seven high schools in Guangzhou, the
   capital of Guangdong, China. The major findings indicate that high
   school students had the lowest identity in physics among the three
   disciplines. Moreover, physics identity was found to be a significant
   indicator that had the strongest effect on students' intentions to
   choose science-related college programs, while biology identity was a
   non-significant indicator with the weakest effect on intended selection
   of a college science program. The results of this study have practical
   implications for enhancing high school students' science identities.},

Abstract = {This study investigated student and classroom level variables related to
   student science achievement by using the Trends in International
   Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015 dataset. Multilevel modeling
   was applied in this secondary analysis to examine how science
   self-concept, school relatedness, and science teaching quality predicted
   student science achievement at both the student and classroom levels.
   Data from a total of 14,291 grade 8 students in the USA were included in
   the study. Results showed that after accounting for gender and SES
   (control variables), self-concept was a statistically significant,
   positive predictor of science achievement at the student level. At the
   classroom level, classroom-mean self-concept and sense of relatedness
   were both statistically significant, positive predictors of science
   achievement. Students' perceived teaching quality was not a
   statistically significant predictor at either the student or classroom
   level. Implications of these results for science teaching and learning
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Students' socioeconomic status (SES) is not only directly related to
   mathematics achievement but also indirectly related to mathematics
   achievement through their unequal opportunity to learn (OTL). Despite a
   plethora of studies about how mathematics achievement is associated with
   SES and OTL, few systematic studies have examined the differential role
   SES plays in the relationship between curriculum-based mathematics
   performance and application-based mathematics literacy. To bridge the
   gap in the literature, this study aims at addressing the relationship
   between curriculum-based mathematics and application-based mathematics
   while considering the OTL associated with students at the two different
   assessment time points. Using the unique data set from the Russian
   Federation in which a subset of the 2011 Trends in International
   Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) student sample also took the
   Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) assessment 1 year
   later, we found that lower SES students had difficulties in transferring
   their curriculum-based mathematics knowledge and skills to mathematics
   literacy, which plays an important role in the present society's
   high-complexity demands. These results suggest that students with a
   lower SES need to receive greater attention and focus on their
   mathematics learning so as to improve their capacity to interpret and
   evaluate real-world problems mathematically and to make better decisions
   using this competency.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the written answers and explanations by 26 Brazilian
   high-school students who attempted to solve double and multiple
   proportionality problems using the cross-product algorithm. We focused
   on students' awareness of the scalar and functional relations among the
   quantities described in verbal problems, an aspect that has been part of
   their school instruction. Our results show that, in their written work,
   the students included data tables or pairs of values, usually with their
   referents and connected by arrows indicating the scalar or the
   functional relations described in the problems. In most cases, during
   individual interviews, they explained their solutions in terms of these
   relations. Our findings suggest that students' understanding of
   proportion relationships between quantities in verbal problems
   constitutes a basis for their understanding and correct use of
   algorithms.},

Abstract = {With an increased emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM) education, educators have often adopted engineering
   projects for integrating interdisciplinary knowledge through engineering
   design process. However, there is scant research that has empirically
   documented the relationships among students' understanding of the
   knowledge and their characteristics on the design product. This study
   uses structural equation modeling to examine the influence of students'
   scientific knowledge, design process, and critical thinking on their
   design product of the engineering project. A theoretical model was
   constructed to identify the factors that affected the design product.
   Study data were collected from 613 high school students, aged 16-17
   years, regarding their scientific knowledge, design processes, and
   critical thinking. The results showed that design process played a
   mediating role in the effects of knowledge and critical thinking on the
   final design product. Students who could deduce, explain, and evaluate
   had an increased ability to apply scientific knowledge during the design
   process. These results indicate that scientific knowledge has an effect
   on the process and products of engineering projects completed by high
   school students. This study also suggested that the science and
   technology education community should consider offering high school
   students learning opportunities to promote their cognitive skills and
   facilitate connections between knowledge and practice.},

Abstract = {This study has two aims. The first one is to reveal the science teacher
   candidates' misconceptions about the density by using a four-tier
   diagnostic test, and the second one is to determine to what extent
   science teacher candidates have scientific knowledge, lack of knowledge,
   and misconceptions about the density. In order to achieve these aims, a
   four-tier density diagnostic test was developed with the KR-20
   reliability coefficient of 0.753 based on the correct answers, and the
   KR-20 reliability coefficient of 0.528 based on the misconceptions. To
   determine the misconceptions about the density with the developed test,
   data were collected from a total of 470 science teacher candidates from
   seven different universities in Turkey. With the developed four-tier
   diagnostic test, 48 different misconceptions were revealed. The results
   of the research showed that about one fourth of science teacher
   candidates had a misconception about the density and that the ratio of
   six of the resulting misconceptions was over 10\%. It may be suggested
   that this study conducted on science teacher candidates should also be
   conducted on middle and high school students and experimental studies
   should be carried out to eliminate the misconceptions that emerged in
   this study.},

   Praxeological Analysis of Symmetry and Transformations in Geometry},

Abstract = {This study is aimed at comparing the content in mathematics textbooks
   from Japan and England, focusing on symmetry and transformations at the
   lower secondary level. We adopted the concept of praxeology, a main
   construct of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD). Using the
   ATD framework, our approach regarded textbooks as an empirical source
   which can reveal knowledge to be taught in the didactic transposition
   process. The praxeological analysis results indicated that symmetry and
   transformations in the Japanese textbooks were strongly influenced by
   the teaching of geometric proofs, while transformations in the textbooks
   from England had many connections to other contexts or contents across
   domains. These findings suggested the ways in which the knowledge of
   symmetry and transformations is differently situated in the two
   countries' textbooks in terms of different praxeological organisations.
   We further discussed our findings for elaborating the theoretical and
   methodological aspects of this study, which can potentially contribute
   to future research on textbooks in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {This design research investigated the mathematical practices that eight
   graders (14-year-old students) developed when learning about prisms,
   cylinders, and their surface areas. An inquiry-based learning
   environment was created for students to engage in argumentation. The
   instruction was enriched by use of a dynamic geometry software, namely
   GeoGebra, to assist students in visualizing and reasoning about 3D
   shapes. Rasmussen and Stephan's three-phase method (2008) was used to
   organize the collected data, which in turn were analyzed using
   Krummheuer's model of argumentation (2015). The results indicated the
   emergence of three mathematical practices and several taken-as-shared
   ideas: (1) defining prisms, (2) computing the surface area of a prism,
   and (3) computing the surface area of a cylinder. The study's results
   revealed that students' understanding improved when learning concepts
   simultaneously with argumentation and dynamic geometry software.},

Title = {What Major ``Socio-Scientific Topics{''} Should the Science Curriculum
   Focused on? A Delphi Study of the Expert Community in China},

Abstract = {Science and technology play an important role in the development of
   human society. Thus, science education should reflect the trend of
   social development and prepare students to think about and make wise
   decisions on major social topics related to science. As an aspect of the
   societal dimension of science, socio-scientific topics (SSTs) have a
   great influence on social development. In order to prepare students to
   participate in modern social life effectively, shape the society in a
   sustainable way, and become responsible citizens in the future, what
   major SSTs should science curriculum relevant to students and the
   society focus on? In this study, the famous forecasting method, the
   Delphi method, was used to explore the above-mentioned question.
   Thirty-three experts who came from Chinese universities and scientific
   research institutes were invited to make effective decisions based on
   the backgrounds of social development and students' all-round
   development demands during a three-stage Delphi process. The results
   showed that six level-one SSTs that referred to the generalized and
   superior socio-scientific fields and thirty corresponding level-two SSTs
   that referred to their specific and inferior topics achieved consensus
   and should be emphasized in the science curriculum. The six level-one
   SSTs are ``environmental issues,{''} ``safety and health,{''}
   ``resources and energy,{''} ``ecological system,{''}
   ``biotechnology,{''} and ``new materials.{''} It is believed that the
   conclusion is helpful to promote the development of students' key
   competencies and can provide advice and enlightenment for science
   curriculum reform all over the world.},

Abstract = {Spatial abilities-required in both academic and everyday information
   processing-are recommended as an important target for explicit
   instruction in the K-12 curriculum. However, most school curricula do
   not address this spatial issue, probably because spatial ability is a
   general rather than domain-specific skill and also due to debate
   regarding individuals' ability to transfer general skills to novel
   tasks. In particular, little is known about elementary school children's
   object structure perspective-taking (OSPT) ability. We developed an
   age-appropriate OSPT assessment tool and examined differences in OSPT
   ability between 1st and 4th graders who did or did not receive OSPT
   training; children's OSPT ability in relation to 3 object types:
   detailed everyday objects, contour only, and abstract geometrical target
   objects; the ability to identify a view seen by an observer and the
   ability to determine the vantage point from which a given view is seen;
   and problem-solving involving far transfer and difficult items.
   Problem-solving strategies and relations between these young children's
   OSPT performance and their mathematic achievements were examined to
   further investigate the possible contribution of spatial ability to STEM
   learning. Our findings are promising in that a relatively short training
   effected significantly children's OSPT ability-a general intellectual
   skill-calling for the development and introduction of OSPT-relevant K-12
   curriculum, possibly using our training program as a model. Such
   curriculum is relevant in particular for girls, of whom OSPT showed
   significant correlation with mathematic scores for contoured and
   geometric objects. Fourth graders performed better than 1st graders, but
   the latter improved more.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to compare the college enrollment and STEM
   college major choice rates of graduates of a STEM-focused charter school
   system to those of students who graduated from traditional public
   schools in the state of Texas and the USA for low-income,
   first-generation, and underrepresented groups. In addition, the factors
   students perceived as important in their STEM career selection were
   examined. Participants were Harmony Public Schools (HPS) alumni who
   graduated between year 2002 and 2016. Data were collected through annual
   and additional surveys via e-mails and Facebook. Data were analyzed
   descriptively to answer the research questions. It was found that HPS
   had significantly higher college enrollment rates in all minority groups
   including female, African American, Hispanic, and low-SES when compared
   to public school students in the state of Texas and the USA. The second
   research question revealed that HPS graduates' STEM major choice rates
   were significantly higher than their counterparts in the state of Texas
   and the USA in all subgroups including female and students of color.
   Students' self-interest, teachers, and parents were found to be the top
   three factors that students thought affected their major choice.},

   with verbal problems related to the generalisation of a functional
   relationship. Drawing from the functional approach to early algebra and
   set in Spain, the study expands on earlier research conducted on primary
   school students' use of letters in algebraic contexts. Their initial
   reactions to the use of letters to represent indeterminate quantities
   and how those reactions changed in the course of three sessions are
   described. Analyses of the students' written answers together with their
   participation in group discussions yield qualitative data on how
   students associate the idea of variability with indeterminate quantities
   and use letters, numbers or both to represent that notion.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the findings of a group of teacher candidates with
   undergraduate degrees in a STEM discipline who were followed through an
   intensive 1-year preparation program and their 1st year of teaching. We
   report on the affordances and challenges participants' discipline
   knowledge presented to developing pedagogical content knowledge during
   their student teaching experience and their 1st year of teaching. The
   participants were interviewed at 3 different times: the start of their
   teacher preparation program, the end of a year-long clinical teaching
   experience, and the end of their 1st year of teaching. Their mentor
   teachers were interviewed at the end of the participants' year of
   student teaching. Each semi-structured interview included questions
   regarding the participants' discipline backgrounds and transition to
   teaching. The interviews were coded and analyzed to identify emergent
   themes. We found that having mathematics or science discipline knowledge
   allowed for several affordances: participants could focus on teaching,
   readily provide alternative explanations, and incorporate additional
   resources into lessons. A challenge of their discipline knowledge,
   possibly exacerbated by biased views of their disciplines, was making
   content accessible to students. We consider these findings in light of a
   framework we have developed for mathematics and science teacher
   pedagogical content knowledge. We suggest teacher preparation programs
   for teacher candidates with mathematics and science undergraduate
   degrees need not only devote specialized attention to connecting that
   content knowledge to teaching but also engage these prospective teachers
   in situations that purposefully make evident to them the need to attend
   to student thinking.},

Abstract = {Teachers' ways of using curriculum materials create not only meaningful
   learning opportunities for students but also opportunities for teachers
   to learn and change their teaching practices; however, not enough
   research has investigated precisely how. This study investigates how
   teachers' implementation of innovative curriculum materials specifically
   designed to support formative assessment practices provides learning
   opportunities for teachers to become more responsive to student
   mathematical thinking. 2 teachers' regular lessons as well as those
   delivered using the innovative curriculum materials were observed; each
   teacher was observed over the course of 1 academic year. The analysis of
   the 2 teachers' cases demonstrates how their different curriculum
   adaptation strategies led to different learning opportunities for each
   of them. Although teachers' enactment of innovative curriculum materials
   in class naturally creates opportunities for them to learn about the
   mathematical content as well as their students' mathematical thinking,
   these findings discuss precisely how to promote teacher learning and
   improvement of teaching practices using formative assessment strategies
   guided by curriculum materials. The implications in relation to
   supporting teachers' instructional improvement while implementing
   reform-oriented curriculum materials, and to designing curriculum
   materials facilitating teacher learning, are also discussed.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the role of students' classroom learning
   environment perceptions and teacher effectiveness in 7th grade students'
   self-regulation in science classes. Students' self-regulation was
   examined in terms of self-efficacy, achievement goals, and metacognitive
   strategy use which constitute important components of self-regulation.
   The relations of students' perceived classroom learning environment
   (i.e. student cohesiveness, teacher support, involvement, investigation,
   task orientation, cooperation, and equity) and teacher effectiveness
   (i.e. teachers' beliefs, characteristics, and occupational well-being)
   to students' self-regulation were tested by conducting separate HLM
   analyses considering the nested structure of the data. To select a
   nationally representative sample, two-stage random sampling approach was
   used. Data were collected from 372 science teachers and their 8198
   seventh grade students in Turkey. Results indicated that perceived
   classroom learning environment variables were good predictors of
   students' self-regulation in learning science. Among the learning
   environment variables, the task orientation appeared to be the most
   powerful predictor. Additionally, teacher variables were found to have
   direct relations with students' self-regulation and moderate the
   relationships between learning environment and self-regulation
   variables.},

Abstract = {This study explored the design and implementation of the Cover-up and
   Un-cover games, two manipulative-based fraction games, in 14 fifth-grade
   classrooms. We examined how the fraction concepts were integrated into
   the game design and explored the nature of teacher-student interactions
   during games using lesson videos. Our examination showed that
   interactions focused on game progress, rules, and turn taking with
   little exploration of strategies or the underlying mathematics. To
   compare the quality of teacher-student interactions during games with
   interaction quality during other instructional activities, we coded 5
   videotaped lessons from each of the 14 classrooms. Statistical results
   from a dependent t test indicated that teacher-student interactions were
   of statistically significant lower quality during games than during
   non-game segments with similar instructional purpose. Teachers might
   benefit from additional curriculum support and training to implement
   games as rich mathematical learning opportunities.},

Abstract = {This study explored the processes in which adult readers integrate
   text-figure information when reading geometric descriptions. Because
   geometry conveys rich spatial information, we investigated the reading
   scanpaths as text- or figure-directed and the given-new effects. Eye
   movement data from 65 college student participants showed that
   approximately 1\% inspected the figure-first, while the other displayed
   the text-first which included 86\% displayed the text-directed. Although
   the descriptions that violated the given-new ordering did not affect the
   accuracy of the test, they did increase reaction time, figure-fixation
   duration, and the number of saccades from text to figure. The transition
   paths showed that the participants shifted their fixations to the figure
   to refer to corresponding elements when they encountered new geometric
   elements in the text. The descriptions that violated the given-new
   ordering influenced the reading processes and efficiency. These findings
   indicate that although the readers spent 40\% fixation duration on
   figure, their reading pattern was text-directed, and the word ordering
   of description affects integration of geometric text and figure.},

Abstract = {In this exploratory study, we developed a portrait of the challenges and
   strategic responses of secondary mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) in
   Chinese universities. The MTEs reported encountering more challenges
   when teaching pedagogical courses and supervising student teachers than
   when teaching college mathematics courses and teaching mathematical
   problem-solving courses. This finding reflects a key difference between
   the content, goals, and teaching demands of these 2 elements of
   mathematics teacher education programs (acting in the role of an MTE
   versus the role of a mathematics teacher). In this study, we also
   analyzed the strategies that MTEs use to deal with the challenges that
   arise in their work and the suggestions they have for the training of
   future MTEs.},

Abstract = {Little research in the field of Mathematics Education is directed
   towards emotions of students beyond their emotions in problem-solving.
   In particular, the daily emotions of students in a mathematics class
   have been sparsely studied in the field of mathematics education. In
   order to fill this gap, this qualitative research aims to identify high
   school students' emotional experiences in the mathematics classroom and
   identify the appraisal structures that support such emotional
   experiences. Focus group interviews were carried out until theoretical
   saturation of the data was achieved (N = 53 in nine focus groups
   interviews). Data analysis is based on the theory of cognitive structure
   of emotions, which specifies eliciting situations for each emotion and
   the variables that affect intensity. The emotional experiences in this
   structure are as follows: satisfaction, disappointment, hope, fear, joy,
   distress, boredom, interest, pride, reproach, self-reproach, like and
   dislike. These results show that the emotional experiences of students
   are based on their appraisals of events, objects and agents in terms of
   a structure of goals.},

Title = {Relationships Between Student Perception of Teacher-Student Relations
   and PISA Results in Mathematics and Science},

Abstract = {Teacher-student relations have a significant correlation with student
   motivation, academic performance and discipline. For example, the
   meta-analysis by Hattie (2009) revealed an effect size of d = 0.72 for
   the effect of relations on achievement, and the meta-analysis by Finn,
   Schrodt, Witt, Elledge, Jernberg \& Larson (Communication Education,
   58(4), 516-537, 2009) showed a correlation of 0.55 between the perceived
   care by teachers and student achievement. These were established by
   comparing students, but comparisons of schools or countries with high or
   low levels of teacher-student relations are missing. The present paper
   analyses the correlation between teacher-student relations and Programme
   for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 results in science and
   mathematics on three levels: student, school and country level. The
   study shows a weak positive relationship (correlations up to 0.16) at
   the student level, and a positive relationship (up to 0.34) at school
   level. The multilevel analysis revealed a negative relationship between
   teacher-student relations and PISA results (r = -.51) at the country
   level. To understand the negative relationship, also known as an
   ecological fallacy, the countries were grouped into geographical regions
   in which the relationship was insignificant and the positive effect of
   teacher-student relations was found by comparing with some neighboring
   countries. Implications for practice and further studies are proposed on
   the basis of these findings.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we offer illustrations of a mathematics teacher's
   difficulties with content knowledge when trying to find connections
   between school mathematics and science; we do so by describing the
   development of this teacher's thinking and learning in her pursuit of
   connections between the concepts of slope of a line and density of
   matter. The paper is based on a sub-study that is part of a larger
   Colombian project, PROMESA (Creating Science and Mathematics Connected
   Learning Experiences that Open Opportunities for the Promotion of
   Algebraic Reasoning), which incorporated a Professional Learning
   Programme (PLP) seeking to integrate school science and mathematics
   teachers into working teams, in order to create science and mathematics
   connected learning experiences that considered the promotion of
   algebraic reasoning. The `challenging questions' that emerged for this
   teacher, during the workshops of the induction stage of the PLP, became
   the driving force for her continued engagement in learning mathematics
   content in a connected way, as opposed to the compartmentalised
   content-item thinking that she had experienced as a school student. We
   provide illustrations of first steps in the development of a teacher's
   mathematical understanding, which can support growth of mathematical
   knowledge for teaching.},

Abstract = {An ultimate goal of higher education is to prepare our future workers
   with needed knowledge and skills. This includes cultivating students to
   become proficient reasoners who can utilize proper scientific reasoning
   to devise causal inferences from observations. Conventionally, students
   with more years of higher education are expected to have a greater level
   of scientific reasoning. Also expected traditionally is that studying
   science and engineering or attending top-rated universities can better
   promote students' scientific reasoning than studying other majors or
   attending lower ranked institutions. In this study, we used Lawson's
   Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (LCTSR) with 1,637 Chinese
   students in different years of study, different fields, and different
   university tiers. It was found that regardless of which major or
   university students entered, their scientific reasoning measured by the
   LCTSR showed little variation across the entire 4 years of undergraduate
   education. Simply put, there was little association between
   tertiary-level learning and scientific reasoning. This study calls our
   attention to the status quo of higher education and motivates
   researchers across the globe to look into this issue in their own
   nations.},

Abstract = {This study focused on teachers' transfer of a variety of teaching
   methods from a teaching module on nanotechnology, which is an example of
   a topic outside the science curriculum, to teaching topics that are part
   of the chemistry curriculum. Nanotechnology is outside the science
   curriculum, but it was used in this study as a means to carry out a
   change in the way chemistry teachers teach. The participants in the
   study included nine high school in-service chemistry teachers. Three
   research tools were used: (1) semistructured interviews that were
   conducted with the teachers, after they had finished teaching their
   nanotechnology module, and follow-up semistructured interviews that were
   conducted 2 years after the teachers had taught the nanotechnology
   module , and teachers' assessment and evaluation of their own teaching
   method, determining how the nanotechnology modules influenced the
   students who learned according to this program. The data collection
   process continued for 5 years. Most of the teachers indicated that they
   continued teaching the nanotechnology module that they designed and all
   of them stated that they integrated the unique teaching methods into
   their teaching of chemistry. High efficacy beliefs were built based on
   the self-evaluation process that was part of the teachers' professional
   development program. Teaching self-efficacy beliefs and organization
   efficacy beliefs was found to contribute to teachers' sustainable
   changes. The findings in the current research are only limited to the
   topic of nanotechnology; however, we believe that similar results can be
   obtained for any modern scientific topic that is outside the high school
   science curriculum. We suggest that more research should be done to
   determine whether the same findings emerge by using the same approach
   but on another topic.},

Abstract = {Problem solving is often challenging for students because they do not
   understand the problem-solving process (PSP). This study presents a
   three-stage, context-based, problem-solving, learning activity that
   involves watching detective films, constructing a context-simulation
   activity, and introducing a project design to enable students to
   construct a complete PSP. This study was conducted among 103
   eighth-grade students over a period of 14 weeks. The descriptive
   statistics and structural equation model were used to analyze the
   students' PSP performance. Results indicate that context simulation is
   beneficial for cultivating students' abilities to establish and analyze
   questions and then select and develop solutions. In addition, the
   project design cultivated the students' ability to evaluate results and
   apply feedback. Findings from this study demonstrate that context-based
   learning may effectively enable students to establish a complete PSP.},

Title = {PERSISTENCE OF THE INTUITIVE CONCEPTION THAT HEAVIER OBJECTS SINK MORE:
   A REACTION TIME STUDY WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INTERFERENCE},

Abstract = {Recent research efforts have argued for the persistence of some of
   students' frequent scientific misconceptions, even after correct answers
   are produced. Some of these studies, based on the analysis of reaction
   times, have recorded latencies for counter-intuitive or incongruent
   stimuli compared to intuitive or congruent ones. The proposed
   interpretations were that prior knowledge survives learning and still
   coexists with new closer-to-scientific knowledge, producing conflicts
   that delay correct answers. But these conclusions are based on the
   assumption that stimuli from different conditions only differ in the
   presence/absence of interfering misconceptions, which is sometimes, in
   our opinion, a rather fragile claim. Thus, we have designed a task in
   which it is possible to test different levels of interference and not
   only its effects in contrast to another condition. Then, we have used it
   to see if different intensities of interference produce different levels
   of conflict. The task tested the persistence of the misconception that
   ``heavy objects sink more than lighter ones{''}. One hundred
   twenty-eight 14- to 15-year-olds were asked to tell which of the 2 balls
   presented (3 different materials and 3 different sizes) would ``sink
   more{''} than the other. Analysis verified the presence of latencies and
   negative priming. For the most part, results show that the intensity of
   interference does produce corresponding latencies, which suggests
   greater conflict and therefore supports the hypothesis of persistence
   and coexistence of conceptions, even after correct answers are produced,
   and beyond other plausible effects due to the used stimuli.
   Prescriptions for theory and teaching are proposed.},

Abstract = {In line with a current global trend, junior secondary science education
   in Bangladesh aims to provide science education for all students to
   enable them to use their science learning in everyday life. This aim is
   consistent with the call for scientific literacy, which argues for
   engaging students with science in everyday life. This paper illustrates
   Bangladeshi science teachers' perspectives of scientific literacy along
   with their views on teaching practices. Participating teachers held a
   range of perspectives of scientific literacy, including some naive
   perspectives. The paper also reports that whilst teachers' verbalised
   practices in relation to their emphasis on engaging students with
   science in everyday life follows the emphases as required in teaching
   for promoting scientific literacy, their assessment practices may not be
   useful to promote it. The discussion explores the meaning of these
   findings and provides implications for school science educational
   practice in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {This article considers the impact of scaffolding on pre-service science
   teachers' constitution of identities as teachers of inquiry. This
   scaffolding has consisted of 2 major components, a unit on current
   electricity which encompasses the inquiry continuum and an open inquiry
   which is situated in context of classroom practice. Our analysis
   indicates 2 major themes. The first is the importance of scaffolding
   inquiry as a strategy for engaging in the discourses, experiences, and
   emotions that are foundational to the constitution of identity from the
   post-structural perspective. The second theme is that the opportunity to
   conduct an open inquiry, while concurrently considering its pedagogical
   implications, provides our pre-service teachers with an appreciation of
   the value of inquiry.},

Abstract = {Teaching `out-of-field' occurs when teachers teach a subject for which
   they are not qualified. The issues around this increasingly common
   practice are not widely researched and are under-theorised. A
   qualitative pilot study using teacher interviews in 3 rural schools
   examined meanings, support mechanisms and teacher identities associated
   with out-of-field teaching. A thematic analysis isolated factors
   influencing whether teachers self-assessed their practice and identities
   as out-of-field. The `boundary between fields' model was developed to
   emphasise support mechanisms, contextual factors and personal resources
   that influenced the nature of teachers' negotiation of subject
   boundaries and its impact on professional identity. These findings
   provide insight for policy makers, school leaders and teacher educators
   into the conditions required for such teaching to be considered learning
   opportunities.},

Abstract = {Whereas there are some studies presenting the effects of argumentation
   on science knowledge development, there is still a need for research
   discovering the interrelationship between knowledge and argumentation.
   The purpose of this research was to investigate a possible relationship
   between students' engagement in argumentation and their conceptual
   knowledge. A case study design was carried out for this research. The
   participants of the study were tenth graders studying in an urban
   all-girls school. There were 5 argumentations promoted in different
   contexts which were embedded through the dynamics chapter, for a 10-week
   period. Some of the conclusions drawn from the study are as follows:
   First, students' quantity and quality of arguments improve through time
   as they get more involved with argumentation. Second, students'
   knowledge does not improve instantly when they are involved with
   argumentation activities, that is, knowledge development in an
   argumentation process takes time. Third, students' prior knowledge
   affects their participation in argumentation. Last, there are some
   patterns that indicate the relationship between argumentation and
   knowledge. However, students' arguments and their knowledge do not
   develop at the same time.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted with 330 Form 4 (grade 10) students (aged 15 -
   16 years) who were involved in a course of instruction on electrolysis
   concepts. The main purposes of this study were (1) to assess high school
   chemistry students' understanding of 19 major principles of electrolysis
   using a recently developed 2-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instrument,
   the Electrolysis Diagnostic Instrument (EDI), and (2) to assess
   students' confidence levels in displaying their knowledge and
   understanding of these electrolysis concepts. Analysis of students'
   responses to the EDI showed that they displayed very limited
   understanding of the electrolytic processes involving molten compounds
   and aqueous solutions of compounds, with a mean score of 6.82 (out of a
   possible maximum of 17). Students were found to possess content
   knowledge about several electrolysis processes but did not provide
   suitable explanations for the changes that had occurred, with less than
   45 \% of students displaying scientifically acceptable understandings
   about electrolysis. In addition, students displayed limited confidence
   about making the correct selections for the items; yet, in 16 of the 17
   items, the percentage of students who were confident that they had
   selected the correct answer to an item was higher than the actual
   percentage of students who correctly answered the corresponding item.
   The findings suggest several implications for classroom instruction on
   the electrolysis topic that need to be addressed in order to facilitate
   better understanding by students of electrolysis concepts.},

Abstract = {The research study this article is based on aims to implement research
   knowledge to teaching, that is, the concept of critical aspects and
   dimensions of variation used in the variation theory. To do this, the
   researchers worked with willing teachers to explore how to make
   mathematics teaching more effective. This paper illustrates how teachers
   make use of a learning theory, the variation theory, as well as their
   own professional expertise and collaboration to help students improve
   their mathematical understanding of subtraction as well as their
   learning of it. The students' tests, examinations of students'
   mathematical work, the teachers' lessons plan and reports of the
   instructions for lessons form the data base for the article. The
   analysis indicates that one of the critical aspects in the process of
   implementation of the variation theory in the teachers' practice was to
   identify the critical aspects in students' learning. Another critical
   aspect in the implementation of the variation theory was to open up
   dimensions of variation in the identified critical aspects of the
   students. By giving teachers the possibility to develop the ability to
   identify critical aspects in students' learning, dimensions of variation
   are opened up in these aspects, and by applying this knowledge in the
   daily teaching, they have the possibility to improve students' learning.
   The findings suggest that developing an understanding of the students'
   critical aspects can be a productive basis in helping teachers make
   fundamental changes in their instructions and improve students'
   learning.},

Abstract = {This study reports on the process of developing a test to assess
   students' reading comprehension of scientific materials and on the
   statistical results of the verification study. A combination of classic
   test theory and item response theory approaches was used to analyze the
   assessment data from a verification study. Data analysis indicates the
   test has satisfactory validity and reliability. The Reading
   Comprehension of Science Test (RCST) components have a wide range of
   difficulty, which suggests that the RCST is appropriate for a relatively
   large percentage of students. Based on the accepted relationships among
   science, language, and literacy, integrated literacy-science
   instructions are highly recommended.},

Abstract = {The importance of motivation in learning has been widely recognized.
   However, due to its multidimensional and complex nature, it appears
   difficult to synthesize research findings on motivation across studies.
   Heated debates about the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
   on learning and their interaction have been going on since the terms
   started to be used. Moreover, cultural difference acts as another
   crucial factor in the field. Using the Trends in International
   Mathematics and Science Studies 2003 eighth grade mathematics data, this
   study scrutinized the relationship between pleasure-oriented
   (intrinsic-related) and productivity-oriented (extrinsic-related)
   motivation and how they collectively affect students' academic
   performance in East Asian education systems compared with those from
   Australia, England, The Netherlands, and the USA. The study found that
   both types of motivation contributed to East Asian students' mathematics
   achievement in an additive fashion, whereas extrinsic-related motivation
   appeared to have a detrimental effect on their Western counterparts'
   learning. Possible reasons were explored from a cultural perspective.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between family factors and
   students' scientific literacy performance in Hong Kong, which has
   excelled in science performance in previous international studies. Data
   were obtained from the 2006 Programme for International Student
   Assessment. Multilevel analysis was used to examine the relationship
   between parental involvement and investment and students' scientific
   literacy performance. It was found that students' scientific literacy
   performance, which was measured by their science achievement and
   self-efficacy towards science, were significantly associated with
   certain types of parental investment and involvement even after
   controlling background factors of both students and schools. Parental
   investment in cultural resources and parental involvement in terms of
   organising science learning enrichment activities at an early age were
   found to be significantly associated with students' scientific literacy
   performance. Activities that could be provided at an early age (e. g.
   watching TV programmes about science, reading books on scientific
   discovery, watching, reading or listening to science fictions) were
   found to be highly effective activities for promoting children's science
   achievement and self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {This study investigated a gap that may have existed between students'
   expectations and perceptions of the 2007 Pre-Entry Science Program
   (PESP) cohort at the National University of Lesotho and factors that
   might have influenced these expectations and perceptions. Questionnaires
   and semi-structured interviews were used for data collection and
   administered to students participating in PESP. The gaps between
   expectations and perceptions that existed were measured using Cohen's
   effect size. A large effect size was found for the ability of presenters
   to give students a good grasp of concepts within the subject area.
   Factors that seem to have influenced the students' expectations and
   perceptions were identified as students' background knowledge, previous
   experience, informal communication, and individual needs. Suggestions
   made to narrow the gap include knowing students' expectations at the
   beginning of the program and then making a conscious effort to meet
   them.},

Abstract = {This study explores the impact of `Scientific Communication' (SC) skills
   instruction on students' performances in scientific literacy assessment
   tasks. We present a general model for skills instruction, characterized
   by explicit and spiral instruction, integration into content learning,
   practice in several scientific topics, and application of performance
   tasks. The model was applied through an instructional program that
   focuses on the following learning skills: information retrieval,
   scientific reading and writing, listening and observing, data
   representation, and knowledge presentation. Throughout the 7th-8th
   grades, 160 students learned the whole program or one of its components:
   structured instruction (SI) of SC skills, or performance tasks (PT). A
   comparison group of 42 students did not receive instruction of SC
   skills. Students' performances were assessed through a questionnaire and
   a complex task that measured students' scientific content knowledge, SC
   skills, and the quality of the final products. Results indicated that
   students who learned the whole program or one of its components achieved
   higher scores in all categories than the comparison group students. High
   achievers can benefit from just one component of the program: either
   structured instruction (SI) or learning from practice (PT). However,
   they can hardly acquire SC skills spontaneously. Low and average
   achievers require both components of the SC program to improve their
   performances. Results show that without planned intervention, the
   spontaneous attainment of SC skills occurs only to a limited extent.
   Systematic teaching of skills can make a significant difference. The
   explicit instruction of skills integrated into scientific topics, the
   opportunities to implement the skills in different contexts, the role of
   performance tasks as `assessment for learning'-all these features are
   important and necessary for improving students' scientific literacy. Our
   general model of skills instruction can be applied to the instruction of
   other high-order skills. Its application can lead to the realization of
   the central goal of science education: literate students possessing
   scientific knowledge.},

Title = {IDENTIFYING SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT
   STATISTICAL CORRELATION, AND THEIR POSSIBLE CAUSES: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY
   USING CONCEPT MAPPING WITH INTERVIEWS},

Abstract = {Correlation is an essential concept in statistics; however, students may
   hold misconceptions about correlation, even after receiving instruction.
   This study aimed to elucidate (1) the misconceptions held by senior high
   school students about correlation, using the tool of concept mapping
   along with interviewing, (2) the possible causes of these
   misconceptions, and (3) the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations
   of the adopted concept mapping using an interviewing technique for
   identifying student misconceptions. Twenty-five grade-12 students who
   had received tuition on correlation were the subjects of this study.
   Concept mapping through interviewing was used to collect and analyze
   data in order to identify the subjects' misconceptions, and their
   possible causes. The major study results are as follows. (1) Seven
   misconceptions about correlation were detected. Of these seven
   misconceptions, five were newly discovered by this study, while the
   other two are similar to those found by previous studies. Each of the
   seven misconceptions was held by 20-68\% of the subjects, showing their
   prevalence and significance. (2) Four major factors related to the
   development of misconceptions about correlation were identified:
   learning materials, language, daily-life experiences, and existing
   mathematical concepts. (3) The concept mapping through the interviewing
   technique adopted in this study was effective in detecting
   misconceptions about statistics, especially in revealing new
   misconceptions, and it was also helpful in exploring their possible
   causes. However, tremendous effort and the time consumed are the major
   limitations of this technique. (4) The paper concluded by providing some
   recommendations for researchers and educators.},

Abstract = {The concept of dimension, one of the most fundamental ideas in
   mathematics, is firmly rooted in the basis of the school geometry in
   such a way that mathematics teachers rarely feel the need to mention
   anything about it. However, the concept of dimension is far from being
   fully understood by students, even at the college level. In this paper,
   we examine whether the Cartesian x-y plane is responsible for students
   difficulty in estimating the value of the dimension of an object, or is
   it only students misconceptions about dimension that lead them to a
   false estimation of the value of the dimension of various objects. A
   second question discussed in this paper examines whether the system of
   coordinates acts as an epistemological obstacle or whether it has only a
   didactical character.},

Abstract = {The intervention programmes have a direct influence on teachers'
   knowledge of teaching different topics. This paper focuses on how Grade
   8 natural science teachers' knowledge developed during an intervention
   programme. Eight schools were selected to participate, and 25 Grade 8
   Natural Sciences teachers from Gauteng province participated. Data were
   collected during the intervention sessions, and participants completed a
   written TSPCK test and content representation tool. Quantitative data
   were analysed using the Rasch analysis model, and qualitative data were
   analysed using content analysis of TSPCK episodes using the TSPCK
   rubric. The episode was a response segment, where TSPCK components were
   used to transform the topic content. The findings showed that teachers'
   pedagogical content knowledge improved significantly in different
   components of TSPCK. The teachers' PCK development was revealed through
   extensive use of knowledge of representation including demonstrations
   using diagrams aimed at transforming the concept in planning. Besides,
   during the intervention, teachers were able to collaborate, have
   explicit discussions on specific topics, and provide explanations on the
   use of the five TSPCK components. The study implies that the development
   of PCK in fundamental topics in a discipline can be implemented through
   a TSPCK-based intervention.},

Abstract = {In this study, we aim to investigate the types of questions that
   Taiwanese mathematics teachers pose and in which instructional
   situations they do so during mathematics lessons at the secondary school
   level. The classroom teaching of six experienced mathematics teachers
   was analyzed. Quantitative analysis showed that the mathematics teachers
   tend to give lectures rather than ask questions. When the mathematics
   teachers posed questions, only about one-fifth of the questions require
   students to provide high-cognitive responses. We also observed that the
   mathematics teachers differed in the number and type of questions they
   asked in different instructional situations. A cross-examination of the
   types of questions and the lesson structures revealed that two-thirds of
   the mathematics teachers asked high-cognitive questions when practicing
   or reviewing the content with the students. The qualitative analysis
   further identified three instructional purposes for high-cognitive
   questions: connecting the meaning of mathematical concepts, stimulating
   multiple solutions to a problem, and exploring mathematical
   relationships across different problem contexts. The results imply that
   mathematics teaching at the secondary school level in Taiwan is more
   teacher-centered, and the mathematics teachers do not often ask
   questions during classroom teaching. However, the teachers tend to ask
   high-cognitive questions for assessment purposes to ensure that the
   students have understood the concepts and can proceed to advanced
   mathematics.},

   about regulative or metacognitive behaviors that are essential to
   understanding this process. In this study, we investigate metacognitive
   behavior in problem posing. We aim at (1) identifying
   problem-posing-specific metacognitive behaviors and (2) applying these
   identified metacognitive behaviors to illustrate differences in
   problem-posing processes. For these aims, we identified
   problem-posing-specific metacognitive behaviors of planning, monitoring
   \& control, and evaluating in task-based interviews with primary and
   secondary pre-service teachers. As a proof of concept, the identified
   behaviors are applied on two selected transcript fragments to illustrate
   how a problem-posing-specific framework of metacognitive behavior
   reveals differences in problem-posing processes.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to explore the effect of using dynamic
   mathematics software in a distance education environment on students'
   understanding of trigonometric functions. The sample of the study
   consists of 45 first-year students enrolled in two associate degree
   programs of a state university. In the research, the lessons in the
   experimental group were carried out in a distance education environment
   where synchronous and asynchronous education methods were integrated
   with the GeoGebra program, which is a dynamic mathematics software, and
   in the control group, in the traditional distance education environment
   without using the GeoGebra program. Both quantitative and qualitative
   approaches were used to analyze the data. The data were obtained from
   pre-test, post-test, and online interviews with students. The results
   revealed that the post-test scores of the students who used the dynamic
   mathematics software in the distance education process were
   significantly higher than the scores of the control group students. In
   addition, as a result of the online interviews, it was determined that
   the experimental group achieved a higher level of understanding in
   comparison to the control group.},

Abstract = {This qualitative within-individual case design study involved six
   adolescents (age 10-14 years) engaging in a think-aloud observational
   protocol to read two texts on climate change from contrasting
   viewpoints. The participants completed a prior knowledge assessment and
   survey of technology used to assess potential mediating factors. Survey
   and observational data are presented as participant profiles. Results
   illustrated the effect of participants' background knowledge, emotional
   elicitation of text features, cognitive dissonance argument analysis due
   to the contrasting multimodal texts, and impact of visual images on
   participants' comprehension. Our data analyses revealed that there is an
   interconnected and nuanced relationship amongst many text and individual
   factors when adolescents engage in critical reading of SSI multimodal
   texts. This research provides direction for future science education
   research that support learners in critical reading of complex
   socioscientific topics as presented in multimodal texts with adolescent
   learners.},

Abstract = {The relevance of STEM education has been promoted both in Australia and
   internationally, arising from increasing concerns with the shortages of
   a highly skilled workforce and economic pressures to increase national
   competitiveness. Against this backdrop of the global push to embed STEM
   in schools, this paper explores how Australian schools and teachers
   responded to this agenda. Employing the notion of relevance, this paper
   conducted a qualitative case study in an Australian secondary school to
   address the question: how the broad vision of STEM as a reform agenda
   was interpreted by teachers and framed in their school. The findings
   show that focusing on the relevance of STEM points to the potential
   utility and applicability of STEM when it is integrated into formal
   schooling, including the ways that STEM can be relevant for students,
   the curriculum, teaching practices, and the broader STEM context. STEM
   is made relevant because of these connections and the meanings that
   arise through that connecting. Moreover, the study illustrates that the
   teachers' perceptions of the relevance of STEM education was informed by
   their backgrounds, experiences, and roles in school. Thus, even within
   one school, there can be different perspectives on how STEM can be made
   useful and applicable. Understanding these perspectives can be the first
   step towards the development of a shared vision required to facilitate
   school change.},

Title = {Professional Growth of Physics Teacher-Leaders in a Professional
   Learning Communities Program: the Context of Inquiry-Based Laboratories},

Abstract = {This study presents 3 case studies that examine the processes involved
   in the professional growth of physics teacher-leaders (TLs) in a
   national network of professional learning communities (PLCs). This
   program has been operating since 2012, using a ``Fan Model{''} where the
   TLs participate in a PLC (TL-PLC) led by a team from the Weizmann
   Institute of Science, while they simultaneously teach in high school and
   lead nationwide regional PLCs of physics teachers. The context of the
   study was inquiry-based laboratories, which are aimed at integrating
   aspects of authentic research into the high-school physics laboratory.
   The Interconnected Model of Professional Growth (Clarke and
   Hollingsworth, Teaching and Teacher Education, 18:947-967, 2002) was
   extended, adjusted to physics TLs, and used to study the processes
   involved in the growth of the 3 case studies within different aspects of
   their practice. Changes in their knowledge, attitudes, and practice, as
   well as the factors that motivated, contributed to, or inhibited their
   professional growth, were studied over the course of 3 years. Individual
   growth pathways were found in each case, as well as similar patterns for
   all 3. The TL-PLC served as an interactive and supportive learning
   environment, and the mechanisms of ``Enactment{''} and ``Reflection{''}
   promoted changes in the TLs' knowledge, attitudes, and practice.
   Addressing challenges such as students' difficulties as well as PLC
   teachers' motivation and attitudes enhanced the TLs' growth as teachers
   and as PLC leaders. The findings suggest that PLC programs can serve as
   an effective framework for the professional growth of TLs, as well as
   for promoting reform initiatives in science education.},

Abstract = {Nurturing autonomous learners is a fundamental instructional goal, aimed
   at honing students' problem-solving skills for use in later educational
   and career experiences. The study explores the results of a yearlong
   program providing professional learning to mathematics student teachers
   with the aim of nurturing mathematically talented students (MTS) as
   autonomous learners in heterogeneous classes, using generic questions.
   Taking one program participant (Effy) as a case study, the research
   examined changes in her stated goals, questioning approach and
   reflection in the context of nurturing students' autonomous learning
   while problem solving (with a focus on asking generic questions).
   Applying a qualitative paradigm, I analyzed Effy's reflective reports,
   her videotaped excerpts of her teaching situations, her assignments, and
   her initial questionnaire. Findings suggest that she moved from using
   small-step teaching towards asking generic questions through a
   four-stage process of change: exposure, modification, incubation, and
   accommodation. Changes were detected in her stated goals, instructional
   approach, and reflection on action. The study provides empirical support
   for the notion that teachers can be taught to use generic questions with
   the aim of promoting autonomous learners.},

Abstract = {This study examined the relationships among cultural values, goal
   orientations, and mathematics achievement in mainland China. Structural
   equation models were used to analyze data on 350 Grade 5 students. The
   results showed that mathematics achievement was positively related to
   family-support and mastery goal orientations and negatively related to
   performance-avoidance goal orientation; that family recognition through
   achievement positively predicted mastery, performance-approach,
   performance-avoidance, and family-support goal orientations; that
   conformity to norms was positively linked to mastery,
   performance-approach, and family-support goal orientations; and that
   collectivism had a positive association with the adoption of
   family-support goal orientation, whereas emotional self-control
   positively predicted performance-avoidance goal orientation. Results of
   bootstrap analysis further confirmed the mediation role of goal
   orientation in the relationships between cultural values and mathematics
   achievement with positive indirect paths via family-support and mastery
   orientations but negative indirect paths via performance-avoidance
   orientation. Possible explanations of the results are discussed.},

Abstract = {This scholarship utilized self-study methodology to examine the first
   author's experience as a non-formal educator and non-formal teacher
   educator within the context of making and tinkering with elementary-aged
   students and university students. Through analysis of multiple forms of
   data, tensions arose and took shape through my interactions with both
   sets of students as we navigated and negotiated our roles and actions
   within two activity systems-a formal learning environment (i.e.
   university course) and a non-formal learning environment (i.e. the
   makerspace). These tensions included (a) the framing and implementation
   of the making task, (b) my authority and power as the making
   ``expert{''} and teacher educator, and (c) undergraduate students' lack
   of competence and knowledge in making and science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The push and pull or tug-of-war of
   my personal existence within and between the 2 activity systems are
   highlighted within these tensions as my ways of being were bounded and
   constrained by formal schooling practices and structures. The tensions
   should challenge teacher educators to consider the role of non-formal
   educators in shaping how we work with students of all ages. This
   involves developing and maintaining shared practices, knowledges, and
   discourses (i.e. third space), and an understanding of how postmodern
   perspectives may uncover our notions of ``education.{''}},

Abstract = {Motivated by often passingly brief textbook discussions of industrial
   capacitors, this study examines how students make sense of textbook
   descriptions to create an industrial rolled-up capacitor. A total of 37
   junior-year students at a top high school in Beijing, China,
   participated in the study. The participants followed their textbook
   guidance and used the parallel-plate structure as a prototype to make a
   rolled-up capacitor. To better understand their reasoning, we randomly
   selected 6 students for interviews: 2 from each of the higher-, middle-,
   and lower-achieving groups according to their course grades. Each
   interviewee was asked to recreate a capacitor, draw electric field lines
   for the (charged) capacitor, and compare its capacitance to that of a
   parallel-plate structure. Student work showed that the participants took
   textbook descriptions at face value without considering critical issues
   such as short circuit. Students' reasoning of electric field and
   capacitance revealed that they confused electric field with magnetic
   field and held classic, nonnormative ideas that liken capacitance to the
   volume of a body. These results notwithstanding, two middle- and
   lower-achieving students attempted to make of the rolled-up capacitor
   and demonstrated a design mindset in their reasoning. Ironically, those
   traditionally considered as higher-achieving students showed no
   advantage in this task.},

Abstract = {This study explored associations among children's prior attitudes, prior
   mathematics knowledge, and frequency of digital game use, with
   children's perceptions of game affordances, and transfer to out-of-game
   performance when interacting with digital math games, with respect to
   gender. Participants were 187 children (ages 8-12). An SEM mediation
   path analysis using MPLUS software showed significant direct effects for
   all pathways for all children, and significant indirect effects on all
   pathways for male children and five of six pathways for female children.
   More favorable attitudes, prior math knowledge, and perception of the
   helping affordances were associated with increased posttest performance,
   while increased frequency of digital game use and stronger perception of
   the hindering affordances was associated with decreased posttest
   performance. The model showed stronger connections for male children
   between frequency of digital game use, prior mathematics knowledge, and
   hindering affordances to the posttest, while female children showed
   stronger connections between attitude and perception of helping
   affordances to the posttest.},

Abstract = {Mathematical achievement is affected by many psychosocial variables.
   Motivation and problem-solving, for instance, are important correlates.
   Although psychosocial variables are susceptible to cultural influences,
   most of the prior studies are based on samples obtained from Western
   populations. This highlights the need for cross-cultural investigations
   into this topic. In light of this, the present study aims to explore
   students' mathematics achievement and its relation to motivation and
   problem-solving styles (approach-avoidance) via cross-cultural
   comparisons. The sample is composed of Taiwanese and American students
   derived from the Program for International Student Assessment 2012
   dataset. The latent class analysis is utilized to explore the unobserved
   tendencies. Results show that to both research groups, similar latent
   subtypes are identified within research variables, suggesting that in
   spite of cultural differences, Taiwanese and Americans exhibit similar
   subtypes of motivation so as problem-solving styles (habits) in relation
   to mathematical learning or everyday challenges. Data further indicate
   that while two countries do not substantively differ on the percentages
   of students having intrinsic or combined motivations (intrinsic and
   extrinsic), more Americans are classified as having an
   extrinsic-oriented motivation and more Taiwanese are classified as
   having no motivation. Possible cultural factors associated with this
   phenomenon are discussed in the article. Interestingly, the
   correspondence analysis maps further reveal that, although two research
   variables both are important correlates, one's everyday problem-solving
   habits seem to be central to mathematical achievement comparing to
   learning motivations. This phenomenon is observed in both Taiwanese and
   American groups; its significance is worthy of further investigations.},

Title = {Mental Arithmetic and Interactivity: the Effect of Manipulating External
   Number Representations on Older Children's Mental Arithmetic Success},

Abstract = {Manipulative artefacts are considered useful scaffolds of arithmetic
   during early years education, but their use is considered less important
   as children get older. Yet adult arithmetic performance often recruits
   artefacts to improve accuracy and efficiency, and so the same benefits
   should accrue to children beyond early years. We propose that
   interacting with manipulatives supports working memory by extending the
   mental workspace. This is a hitherto poorly explored aspect of the
   pedagogical benefits of manipulatives. Forty-three children aged between
   7 and 9 years old were invited to assess whether interacting with
   artefacts supported arithmetic when under a working memory load.
   Interactivity and load were manipulated in a 2 x 2 repeated measures
   design. Children calculated the total of seven digits either with hands
   down-low interactivity-or moving numbered tokens-high interactivity.
   Additionally, in half the conditions, the children performed a second
   task designed to tax working memory. The children were also assessed
   across a battery of measures examining individual differences. As
   expected, performance was considerably worse under load. More sums were
   answered correctly in high-interactivity conditions regardless of
   working memory load. In the high-interactivity condition with a load,
   there were significant correlations between performance and both
   numeracy and fluid intelligence suggesting that even for more numerate
   children manipulatives confer benefits. The expression of arithmetic
   skills depends on the nature of the external resources offered by the
   environment. This dynamic agent-environment transaction highlights the
   pedagogical importance of external resources when assessing children's
   arithmetic abilities.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the effects of educational games, while
   teaching the unit of matter and heat, utilized on students and the
   remarks of the students on the process. The research model called mixed
   method, in which both quantitative and qualitative research methods are
   used together, had been applied. The research group consisted of
   students of two classes studying at the 6th grade of a state school
   located in Gulluce Village of Tuzluca County in Igdir province in the
   east of Turkey in 2015-2016 academic year. ``Matter and Heat Unit
   Achievement Test{''} and semi-structured interview form were utilized as
   data-collecting instruments in the study. According to the results, it
   was determined that there was a significant difference towards the
   experimental group. It is thought that this was a result of the effects
   of educational games on the teaching process. It was also inferred that
   educational games made the learning environment entertaining, different,
   and amusing.},

Abstract = {This study examined and compared the intended mathematics curricula
   according to topic coverage, focus, coherence, and learning progression
   in grades 1-12 within China and the province of Ontario, Canada. The
   findings show that the overall topics in the two curricula are similar:
   Chinese curriculum covers 78 topicsout of 79 while the Ontario
   curriculum covers 76. The two curricula also share a similar general
   sequence such as topics for transfer stages from numbers to functions by
   starting with constant mathematics, then variable mathematics, and
   finally functions. However, the detailed topic design of the 2 curricula
   differs markedly. The Chinese curriculum includes few topics in each
   year, a short duration or span of each topic, and a fast-paced topic
   progression. The Ontario curriculum, in contrast, includes more topics
   each year, longer duration of many topics, and a small pace of topic
   progression in grades 1-8 and a fast pace of topic progression in grades
   9-12. Because of different curriculum designs in grades 1-12, the
   intended curriculum may influence students' cognitive structures of
   mathematics, learning behavior and thinking, learning efficiency and
   achievement, and teachers' professional development. This calls for more
   refined and advanced research on the defined list of topics, topic
   organization, and terms to study curriculum in order to increase student
   learning opportunities.},

Abstract = {In this article, we report on sixth-grade students' responses to a set
   of problem activities that required the application of mathematics,
   science, and engineering knowledge in designing and constructing a paper
   bridge that could withstand an optimal load. Increasing students'
   application and awareness of their disciplinary learning and how they
   are applying this in an integrated STEM activity remains a challenge for
   educators. In addressing this issue, we included a focus on knowledge
   reflection and knowledge scaffolding through thought-provoking student
   workbooks. Among the findings are students' capabilities in planning,
   designing, reflecting, constructing, and redesigning. Students' planning
   indicated that they could justify their proposed bridge type/s, which
   often included a combination of types, by referring to their STEM
   understandings. At the same time, students remained cognizant of the
   problem boundaries. Students' design sketches indicated an awareness of
   the problem constraints, an understanding of basic engineering
   principles, and an application of mathematics and science knowledge.
   Students' reflections on their actions helped them to improve their
   bridge constructions. Suggestions are presented for knowledge
   scaffolding to facilitate the flexible and innovative application of
   STEM learning to new problem situations.},

Abstract = {In this design-based research project, we investigated how and to what
   extent participating in architectural building and problem solving via a
   simulation game-based learning platform (called E-Rebuild) would
   facilitate mathematical practices of middle-school students in the
   informal learning setting. This study encompasses 2 iterative design
   experiments in which 20 middle graders completed E-Rebuild-based
   learning tasks as part of an after school program and a summer math
   camp. Data were collected via screen- and webcam-recorded participation
   actions and reactions, mathematical problem-solving test, and
   interviewing. Enriching prior research on math and science learning
   through making, this study informs how and under what contexts
   mathematical practices and disposition emerge during the making-centered
   learning processes.},

Abstract = {Research on teacher noticing in the field of mathematics education
   research has increased in the last decade; however, only a few studies
   have investigated the social and cultural impact on teachers' noticing.
   This paper describes results of an international comparative study on
   (in-service) mathematics teachers' professional noticing in China and
   Germany, representing Eastern and Western cultures. In this study, 203
   teachers in China and 118 teachers in Germany participated in a
   video-based assessment of their professional noticing, i.e. perception,
   interpretation, and decision-making competencies. Item response theory
   (IRT) and differential item functioning (DIF) were employed for data
   analysis. Findings of the study revealed that German teachers performed
   significantly better than Chinese teachers on noticing aspects related
   to general pedagogy; in contrast, Chinese teachers outperformed their
   German counterparts on noticing aspects connected to mathematics
   instruction. Further DIF detection analysis found that German
   mathematics teachers demonstrated particular strengths in perception as
   a sub-facet of noticing; in contrast, Chinese teachers tended to
   demonstrate strength in analyzing and decision making as other
   sub-facets of noticing. These findings suggest that societal and
   cultural factors, such as different philosophical paradigms, traditions
   of teacher education, and teaching and mathematics curriculum traditions
   are main influencing factors on teachers' professional noticing.},

Abstract = {Tertiary transition in mathematics appears to be an insurmountable
   struggle for many students, including for high achievers in secondary
   school. The high dropout rates in many Western Countries represent a big
   issue from an individual and social point of view. It appears
   particularly significant to analyse this phenomenon in the context of
   the degree course in Mathematics, studying students' cognitive and
   affective reactions to the (often unexpected and severe) difficulties
   encountered in the tertiary transition. With this aim, we developed a
   narrative study in a specific context in Italythat involves excellent
   students from secondary schoolto investigate how successful and dropout
   students describe their experience in transition. Implications for the
   educational practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated how high school credit recovery students
   worked in small groups and used computer-based scaffolds to conduct
   scientific inquiry in a problem-based learning unit centered on water
   quality. We examined how students searched for and evaluated information
   from different sources, and used evidence to support their claims. Data
   sources included screen recordings, interviews, scaffold trace data, and
   scaffold entry quality ratings. Findings indicate that many students
   struggled to use the scaffolding and did not fully respond to scaffold
   prompts. Collaboration within small groups was often inhibited by
   frequent absences, struggles using the scaffolding, desires to complete
   tasks quickly rather than thoroughly, and an expectation that the group
   leader address the questions. However, many groups followed the
   scientific inquiry process prompted by the scaffolding, and support for
   collaboration within the scaffolds led students to negotiate the meaning
   of water quality data, and this in turn led students to see water
   quality as a complex, rather than a binary, construct.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the student and
   teacher-level predictors of Turkish middle school students' engagement
   in science classes. Students' engagement was examined in terms of
   agentic, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. The
   participants of the study were 134 Turkish science teachers and their
   3394 grade 7 students. Separate multilevel models were specified for
   each dimension of students' science engagement. Results of the HLM
   analyses indicated that dimensions of students' science engagement were
   significantly predicted mostly by the student-level variables including
   science self-efficacy, mastery approach and avoidance goals, and
   performance approach goals. Teacher-level variables were influential
   only on the cognitive and emotional engagement. There were also
   cross-level interactions in predicting science engagement. Results were
   discussed in the light of related literature.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to develop a scale for measuring
   content knowledge (CK) and pedagogy content knowledge (PCK) of
   in-service elementary teachers on mathematical fractions. Another aim of
   this study was to consider whether CK and PCK are separate from each
   other, or are in a single body. Therefore, a scale containing 22 items
   about mathematics fractions was designed and administered to 256
   elementary teachers. Exploratory factor analysis indicated four factors
   that three of which are included in PCK, that is, instruction, task, and
   student, whereas CK had just one factor. Also to evaluate fitness of
   model, confirmatory factor analysis was used. The results revealed that
   CK and PCK are separate and correlated, and the scale has suitable
   validity and reliability to measure CK and PCK of in-service elementary
   teachers on mathematics fractions.},

Abstract = {This article reports on an analysis of the process in which knowledge to
   be taught was transposed into knowledge actually taught, concerning a
   task including proportional relationships in an algebra setting in a
   grade 6 classroom. We identified affordances and constraints of the task
   by describing the mathematical praxeology of the two different types of
   knowledge exposed, in the task as such and in the activity of the
   classroom. Through the teacher's explicit process of reasoning,
   modeling, revising, solving, and repeatedly explaining the task, we
   found that the transposition of knowledge was seriously affected by the
   contextualization of the task. Modeling word problems about everyday
   situations has its limitations and can, as in this case, make the
   problem unsolvable unless it is accepted as a ``textbook task{''}
   disguised as real but adjusted to the norms of school mathematics. Such
   constraints may obscure mathematical ideas afforded by the task. We
   conclude that learning opportunities embedded in a task do not
   necessarily surface when a task is treated in a classroom setting.},

Abstract = {This study investigates one issue related to reading mathematical texts
   by presenting a two-dimensional framework for assessing reading
   comprehension of geometric construction texts. The two dimensions of the
   framework were formulated by modifying categories of reading literacy
   and drawing on key elements of geometric construction texts. Three
   categories of reading mathematical texts were recognized and then
   cross-tabulated with three key elements of geometric construction texts
   to create a nine-category assessment framework, which was used to design
   an instrument. After reporting on the validation of the instrument, we
   conclude by discussing the implications of the framework for assessing
   students' reading to learn mathematics and for improving the learning of
   geometric constructions by reading.},

Abstract = {Lebanese educators claim that middle and secondary school students
   exhibit poor understanding of genetics due to misconceptions and
   difficulties that hinder progression in conceptual understanding of
   major genetics concepts and phenomena across different grade levels.
   They attributed these problems to Lebanon's ill-structured genetics
   curriculum which needs a thorough revision in light of curricular reform
   models that take into account student misconceptions, cognitive
   abilities, and past experiences. Despite these claims, no empirical
   tests were done. Consequently, this study aimed to investigate G7-12
   Lebanese students' misconceptions and difficulties in genetics in an
   attempt to design a curriculum that would enhance student understanding
   of genetics. Using quantitative and qualitative data collection methods,
   we obtained an in-depth understanding of the nature of the
   misconceptions and difficulties encountered by students in grades 7-12,
   determined the level of students' genetics literacy, and explored the
   progression of their level of conceptual understanding of major genetics
   concepts across grade levels. A questionnaire was administered to 729
   students (G7-12) in 6 schools and was followed by semi-structured
   interviews with 62 students to validate the questionnaire results, gain
   further understanding of students' misconceptions, and assess their
   level of genetics literacy. Findings showed that patterns of
   inheritance, the deterministic nature of genes, and the nature of
   genetic information were found to be among the most difficult concepts
   learned. Students also showed inadequate understanding of many basic
   genetics concepts which persist across grade levels. Furthermore,
   results indicated that students across all grade levels exhibited a low
   level of genetics literacy. Implications for practice and research are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Chemical representations serve as a communication tool not only in
   exchanges between scientists but also in chemistry lessons. The goals of
   the present study were to measure the extent of student teachers'
   knowledge about chemical representations, focusing on chemical formulae
   and structures in particular, and to explore which factors related to
   the education in school and university contribute to inter-individual
   differences. Using a quantitative cross-sectional design, 322 students
   from 12 German universities in different stages of their university
   education were tested with the Chemical Representations Inventory (CRI,
   Taskin, Bernholt, \& Parchmann, 2015). In addition, a short
   questionnaire was administered containing demographic data and possible
   factors that could have an effect on students' success in solving the
   items of the inventory. The data was analyzed by using Rasch modeling.
   The results show that student teachers' knowledge about chemical
   representations is quite low, with an average of students' total
   achievement of 50 \% in the corresponding inventory on chemical
   representations. A multivariate linear model revealed that passing
   exam(s) in organic chemistry at university, the grade of school leaving
   certificate, gender as well as studying chemistry in upper secondary
   school on basic and advanced levels are significant predictors of
   student teachers' knowledge. In total, these predictors are able to
   explain 30.3 \% of the variance in the test results. The dominance of
   school-related variables in the regression analysis indicates that
   school education seems to be still important after several years of
   studying and is not equalized by education at university.},

Abstract = {Statistics is an increasingly important component of the mathematics
   curriculum. StatSmart was a project intended to influence middle-years
   students' learning outcomes in statistics through the provision of
   appropriate professional learning opportunities and technology to
   teachers. Participating students in grade 5/6 to grade 9 undertook three
   tests, a pre-test, a post-test and a longitudinal retention test over a
   period of 2 years. Their teachers completed a survey that included items
   measuring pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for teaching statistics.
   Despite the development of valid instruments to measure both student and
   teacher content knowledge and teachers' PCK, linking teachers' knowledge
   directly to students' learning outcomes has proved elusive. Multilevel
   modelling of results from 789 students for whom there were 3 completed
   tests and measures from their teachers indicated that students' outcomes
   were influenced positively by their initial teacher's PCK. Extended
   participation of teachers in the project also appeared to reduce
   negative effects of changing teachers.},

Abstract = {This classroom observation study explored how science teachers (N = 22)
   teach for creativity in grades 5-10 in Oman. We designed an observation
   form with 4 main categories that targeted the instructional practices
   related to teaching for creativity{''} questioning strategy, teacher's
   responses to students' ideas, classroom activities to support
   creativity, and whole-lesson methods that foster creativity. An
   open-ended survey was also designed to explore participants'
   justifications for their instructional decisions and practices. The
   findings indicate that the overall level of teaching for creativity was
   low and that participants' performance was the highest for teacher's
   responses to students' ideas category and the lowest for classroom
   activities to support creativity category. We observed that a
   teacher-centered approach with instructional practices geared toward
   preparing students for examinations was dominant and that these science
   teachers were bound to the textbook, following cookbook-style
   activities. Participants believed that they did not have enough time to
   cover the content and teach for creativity and that they were not
   prepared to teach for creativity. Based on these findings, we recommend
   that programs be developed to prepare science teachers to teach for
   creativity.},

Abstract = {The main propose of this study was to examine possible gender
   differences in how junior high school students integrate printed texts
   and diagrams while solving science problems. We proposed the response
   style hypothesis and the spatial working memory hypothesis to explain
   possible gender differences in the integration process. Eye-tracking
   technique was used to explore these hypotheses. The results of eye
   movement indices support the response style hypothesis. Compared to male
   students, female students spent more time and displayed more fixations
   in solving science problems. The female students took more time to read
   the print texts and compare the information between print-based texts
   and visual-based diagrams more frequently during the problem-solving
   process than the male students. However, no gender differences were
   found in the accuracy of their responses to the science problems or
   their performances in the spatial working memory task. Implications for
   psychological theory and educational practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study examines how students' opportunities to engage in
   argumentative activity are shaped by the teacher, the class, and the
   mathematical topic. It compares the argumentative activity between two
   classes taught by the same teacher using the same textbook and across
   two beginning algebra topics-investigating algebraic expressions and
   equivalence of algebraic expressions. The study comprises two case
   studies in which each teacher taught two 7th grade classes. Analysis of
   classroom videotapes revealed that the opportunities to engage in
   argumentative activity with the topic investigating algebraic
   expressions were similar in each teacher's two classes. By contrast,
   substantial differences were found between one teacher's classes with
   regard to the opportunities to engage in argumentative activity with the
   topic equivalence of algebraic expressions. The discussion highlights
   how the interplay between the characteristics of the mathematical topic,
   the characteristics of the class, and the characteristics of the teacher
   contributed to the shaping of students' opportunities to engage in
   argumentative activity.},

Title = {VALIDATING PROPOSED LEARNING PROGRESSIONS ON FORCE AND MOTION USING THE
   FORCE CONCEPT INVENTORY: FINDINGS FROM SINGAPORE SECONDARY SCHOOLS},

Abstract = {This study examines the validity of 2 proposed learning progressions on
   the force concept when tested using items from the Force Concept
   Inventory (FCI). This is the first study to compare students'
   performance with respect to learning progressions both for force and
   motion and for Newton's third law in parallel. It is also among the
   first studies on learning progressions within an East Asian context.
   Data come from 174 Singaporean secondary students who completed the FCI
   during regular school time. FCI questions are coded as ordered multiple
   choice items based on the respective learning progressions, and
   responses are analyzed using a rating scale Rasch measurement model.
   Results show that FCI items have moderate data-model fit and demonstrate
   the expected pattern of difficulty among levels of the learning
   progressions. However, scale reliability and fit for the thresholds
   between levels showed limitations. The students' ability estimates for
   Newton's third law were higher than for force and motion, contrary to
   expectation about the relationship between the 2 aspects of force. The
   paper discusses the connection of these results with the curriculum and
   implications for learning progressions for the force concept. Directions
   for future research on instruments for use with learning progressions
   are also discussed.},

Abstract = {This article describes the results of a study that investigated the
   experiences of a group of high school anatomy and physiology teachers
   who participated in a cadaver dissection laboratory workshop organized
   through a university-school partnership. Teacher feedback was collected
   before, during, and after the workshop through pre-arrival surveys,
   open-ended written responses to questions during the experience, focus
   group interviews with teachers, and follow-up surveys and meetings. Two
   evaluation specialists also attended and engaged in participant
   observation during the dissection experience. Using an interpretive
   qualitative approach, data were analyzed and coded for emergent themes.
   These findings are presented along with first-person narrative
   description of the experience from teachers' perspectives. This article
   contextualizes this initiative relative to hands-on learning of anatomy
   and physiology, secondary science teacher professional development, and
   instructional improvement. Results of this study support the positive
   impact of such experiences on instructor content understanding and
   outcomes for classroom practice. Specific changes to teacher behavior
   and dissection instruction following the workshop and ongoing
   professional development efforts are reported.},

Abstract = {We investigated students' understanding of proportional, inverse
   proportional, and affine functions and the way this understanding is
   affected by various external representations. In a first study, we focus
   on students' ability to model textual descriptions of situations with
   different kinds of representations of proportional, inverse
   proportional, and affine functions. Results highlight that students tend
   to confuse these models and that the representational mode has an impact
   on this confusion: Correct reasoning about a situation with 1
   mathematical model can be facilitated in a particular representation,
   while the same representation is misleading for situations with another
   model. In a second study, we investigate students' ability to link
   representations of proportional, inverse proportional, and affine
   functions to other representations of the same functions. Results
   indicate that students make most errors for decreasing functions. The
   number and nature of the errors also strongly depend on the kind of
   representational connection to be made. Both studies provide evidence
   for the strong impact of representations in students' thinking about
   these different types of functions.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the quality, evolution, and
   position of university students' argumentation about organic agriculture
   over a 4-week argument-critique-argument e-learning experience embedded
   in a first year university biology course. The participants (N = 43)
   were classified into three groups based on their epistemological views.
   Data collected from individual arguments, group deliberations, and
   individual critiques were coded and analyzed to establish the quality
   and evolution of argumentation. Results indicated significant
   improvement in the quality of their justifications between the first and
   second arguments. Post-hoc comparison of epistemological groups
   indicated that the more constructivist-oriented students had a greater
   significant evolution of their justifications than the more
   empiricist-oriented students, but there was no significant main effect
   for epistemological orientation. Qualitative analysis of the intervening
   critiques indicated that some students incorporated or used other
   students' arguments or counter-arguments to change their position or to
   enhance the justification of their original position on organic
   agriculture, while others appeared to be locked into a confirmation-bias
   stance and search for evidence that supported their original position
   and disregarded contradictory evidence.},

Abstract = {There is increasing evidence of a gap between curricular requirements
   and what students actually want to know. One of the factors influencing
   what is taught in the classroom is teachers' attitudes towards
   integrating their students' interests. This study investigated what
   prompts high-school teachers who prepare students for national
   matriculation examination to adjust the curriculum to match their
   students' interests. In the first stage of the study, 350 students'
   biology questions that are not covered by the Israeli biology curriculum
   were presented to 15 experienced biology teachers. These teachers
   provided 19 reasons why they would or would not address these questions
   in their teaching. In stage 2, these 19 reasons were presented to
   another 175 high-school teachers from different disciplines. These
   teachers were asked to rank the importance of each reason in deciding
   whether to include or exclude topics raised by the student which are not
   required by the curriculum. Based on these answers, the 19 reasons were
   classified into four groups: civic literacy, curricular compatibility,
   topic suitability, and curricular limitations. The findings show that
   demographic factors such as gender, experience, and sector, as well as
   the subject taught by the teacher, all influence decisions. Thus, many
   teachers are aware of the interest gap, but the solutions and the
   attention given to this problem vary.},

Abstract = {Science as inquiry and mathematics as problem solving are conjoined
   fraternal twins attached by their similarities but with distinct
   differences. Inquiry and problem solving are promoted in contemporary
   science and mathematics education reforms as a critical attribute of the
   nature of disciplines, teaching methods, and learning outcomes involving
   understandings, attitudes, and processes. The investigative and
   quantitative processes involved in scientific inquiry include seeking
   problems, identifying researchable questions, proposing hypotheses,
   designing fair tests, collecting and interpreting data as evidence for
   claims, constructing evidence-based arguments, and communicating
   knowledge claims. Within this empirical context, science and mathematics
   come together to solve problems with evidence, construct knowledge
   claims, communicate claims, and persuade others that the claims are
   valid and useful. This study examined the intersection of inquiry and
   problem solving and the use of mathematics in 26 extracurricular open
   science inquiries. The category and the appropriateness of the
   mathematical procedures revealed these students used measurement,
   numeracy skills of counting and calculation, and tables and graphs in
   their science inquiries. It was found that most measurements in the
   science inquiries were used appropriately, but there is room for
   improvement with other mathematical procedures that involve higher-level
   thinking skills, such as analyzing and calculating numerical data and
   interpreting graphs and tables. The findings imply that mathematics and
   science are connected in inquiry and should be extended to solve
   real-life problems and that instruction should emphasize comprehending
   and interpreting data.},

Title = {TESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MATHEMATICAL GAMES AS A PEDAGOGICAL TOOL

Abstract = {In an effort to engage children in mathematics learning, many primary
   teachers use mathematical games and activities. Games have been employed
   for drill and practice, warm-up activities and rewards. The
   effectiveness of games as a pedagogical tool requires further
   examination if games are to be employed for the teaching of mathematical
   concepts. This paper reports research that compared the effectiveness of
   non-digital games with non-game but engaging activities as pedagogical
   tools for promoting mathematical learning. In the classrooms that played
   games, the effects of adding teacher-led whole class discussion was
   explored. The research was conducted with 10-12-year-old children in
   eight classrooms in three Australian primary schools, using differing
   instructional approaches to teach multiplication and division of
   decimals. A quasi-experimental design with pre-test, post-test and
   delayed post-test was employed, and the effects of the interventions
   were measured by the children's written test performance. Test results
   indicated lesser gains in learning in game playing situations versus
   non-game activities and that teacher-led discussions during and
   following the game playing did not improve children's learning. The
   finding that these games did not help children demonstrate a
   mathematical understanding of concepts under test conditions suggests
   that educators should carefully consider the application and
   appropriateness of games before employing them as a vehicle for
   introducing mathematical concepts.},

Abstract = {Current mathematics education reforms devoted to reasoning and proof
   highlight its importance in pre-kindergarten through grade 12. In order
   to provide students with opportunities to experience and understand
   proof, mathematics teachers must have a solid understanding of proofs
   themselves. In light of this challenge, a growing number of researchers
   around the world have started to investigate mathematics teachers'
   conceptions of proof; however, much more needs to be done. Drawing on
   lessons learned from research and curricular recommendations from around
   the world, the main purpose of this paper is to review the literature on
   elementary and secondary mathematics teachers' conceptions of proof and
   discuss international implications.},

Title = {CORRELATIONS AMONG FIVE DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES AND THE PERFORMANCE OF
   SELECTED JAMAICAN 11TH-GRADERS ON SOME NUMERICAL PROBLEMS ON ENERGY},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {This study was designed to assess whether the level of performance of
   selected Jamaican 11th-grade physics students on some numerical problems
   on the energy concept was satisfactory and if there were significant
   differences in their performance linked to their gender, socioeconomic
   background (SEB), school location, English language and mathematical
   abilities. The 331 sampled students consisted of 213 boys and 118 girls;
   197 students were from a high SEB and 134 students from a low SEB; 296
   students were from seven urban schools and 35 students from three rural
   schools; 112, 153 and 66 of the students had high, average and low
   English language abilities, respectively, while 144, 81 and 106 of the
   students had high, average and low mathematical abilities, respectively.
   An Energy Concept Test (ECT) consisting of six structured numerical
   questions was employed for data collection. The results indicated that
   although the students' level of performance was regarded as fairly
   satisfactory, there was a lot of room for improvement. There were
   statistically significant differences in the students' performance on
   the ECT linked to SEB, and mathematical abilities in favour of students
   from a high SEB, and high mathematical abilities, respectively. There
   was a positive, statistically significant but weak correlation between
   the students' (a) mathematical abilities, and (b) English language
   abilities and their performance on the ECT, while there were no
   correlations among their gender, school location, and SEB and their
   performance on the ECT.},

Title = {A Study of Grade Two Students Solving a Non-Routine Problem with Access
   to Manipulatives},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 23},
Abstract = {Mathematical problem solving remains a struggle for many students today
   (Celebioglu et al., 2010; Englard, 2010; Gavaz et al., 2021; N. H. Lee
   et al., 2014; Yeo, 2011). Though intervention studies have reported
   measured impact on improving students' problem-solving abilities (Gavaz
   et al., 2021; Gidalevich \& Kramarski, 2019; N. H. Lee et al., 2014),
   few studies examine how learners would approach a non-routine problem
   without learning problem-solving strategies in school (Celebioglu et
   al., 2010; Saygili, 2017; Yazgan, 2015; Yeo, 2011). The latter would
   complement instruction related to strategies by making known the entry
   point of young problem solvers. In this study, 10 Grade Two students in
   a neighborhood primary school in Singapore were individually engaged in
   solving a non-routine problem with access to manipulatives. Based on
   their mathematics instructional history in school, the students have not
   been introduced to the relevant problem-solving strategies related to
   the task. The study examines how the students approach and solve the
   problem. Findings revealed that all the ten students were able to solve
   the problem with eight of them using manipulatives to help them. The
   study recommends that prior to classroom teaching, teachers can invite
   students to share their problem-solving methods and demonstrate how
   formal notations can capture these mathematically. Appropriate
   manipulatives should also be made accessible during problem-solving
   lessons.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to design a task in an everyday context to support high
   school students' exploration of the truth values of propositional
   conditionals and to understand their difficulties. The results showed
   that students could identify that the truth value of a propositional
   conditional is determined by two variables (the truth values of the
   antecedent and the consequent) while organizing the propositional
   conditionals generated from the open sentence and that a social contract
   situation can help students understand why the truth value of a
   conditional with a false antecedent is true. The study also revealed
   that students' difficulties in determining the truth values of
   conditionals are closely related to the time variable in an everyday
   context and the confusion between conditionals and causality. The
   findings from this study on the strategy and difficulties exhibited by
   students when determining the truth value of everyday conditional
   sentences can inform future efforts to teach formal mathematics in
   real-world contexts.},

Abstract = {Metacognition has been a subject of considerable interest in school
   settings, particularly its implications on learning and performance in
   mathematics. While metacognition has been widely studied as a
   multi-faceted construct comprising of metacognitive knowledge,
   regulation and experiences in various combinations, few have examined
   these three facets within a single study. Based on a mixed-method
   design, the validity and empirical relationships among the three
   dominant components of metacognition were investigated using a person-
   and variable-centred approach. Convergent and discriminant validity were
   supported in which robust relationships were found among the three
   components, but some aspects of metacognition differed in their
   associations with mathematics achievement. Expanding on the quantitative
   results, student interviews and classroom data were collected to deepen
   the understanding of metacognitive experiences, and students' learning
   of mathematics. Collectively, the triangulated results showed that low
   achieving students in mathematics tended to rely more on affective
   learning approaches when engaging with mathematics tasks. By contrast,
   students who were high achieving tended to employ cognitive information
   processing strategies. Nonetheless, metacognitive experiences, with
   respect to feelings and emotions, are important and should not be
   overlooked regardless of whether students are high or low achieving in
   mathematics. The results suggest that the path towards more inclusive,
   active participation of low achieving students in the learning of
   mathematics could be better mitigated through the heart (i.e., the
   affect) rather than wholly via the brain (i.e., cognition).},

Abstract = {Mathematical literacy is a keystone of contemporary mathematics
   education research. We collectively, thoroughly explore this set of
   literacy practices from the perspectives of mathematical writing and
   mathematical discussion. Mathematical literacy practices, of course,
   include a third component-reading-which takes a number of forms. This
   document explores the mathematical reading processes of 22 middle school
   students, identifying the strategies most and least used by these
   students, and the ways in which strategy implementation aids their
   reading process. From this study, we can begin to identify how this
   knowledge can be used by teachers, curriculum designers, and educational
   researchers in an effort to aid their students.},

Abstract = {The quality of curriculum resources and teaching practices can constrain
   or promote students' opportunities for mathematics learning, in
   particular, students with diverse language proficiency. The video study
   investigates 18 classes that all used the same curriculum resources
   aimed at developing 367 seventh graders' conceptual understanding of
   percentages to identify the interaction of quality dimensions, the
   enactment of given curriculum resources, and students' mathematical
   achievement (when controlling for mathematical preknowledge and language
   proficiency). Multilevel regression analysis revealed that three quality
   dimensions that can easily be supported by the curriculum resources
   (Mathematical Richness, Cognitive Demand, and Connecting Registers) were
   on a high level, and their variance had no additional interaction with
   students' achievement. In contrast, the 4 quality dimensions that were
   enacted in the teacher-student interaction with more variance (Agency,
   Equitable Access, Discursive Demand, and, in particular, Use of Student
   Contributions) had a significant additional impact on student
   achievement. These findings reveal important insights into the
   implementability of equitable instructional approaches.},

   one territory to another, in the context of each territory's history.
   The paper first examines English policy documents, research and
   published curricula for their use of the term. This suggests that
   `mastery' in England has become associated with mathematics teaching
   practices used in high-performing territories such as Singapore and
   Shanghai (China). But, the efforts to transport approaches predominately
   from East Asian sources, against the background of an existing Western
   set of meanings for the term, have led to considerable inconsistency in
   interpretations and definitions of the `mastery approach'. A subsequent
   case study of eight teachers involved in developing mastery approaches
   in England explores how they make sense of `mastery' in the context of
   these inconsistent messages. We suggest that this generates challenges
   for teachers tasked with implementing mastery approaches, with the
   danger that anything can be done in the name of mastery.},

Abstract = {We investigated French primary school teachers' assessment practice in
   mathematics. Using an online questionnaire on teachers' background,
   teaching, and grading practice, we were able to determine assessment
   profiles of 604 primary school teachers. As evidenced by the teachers'
   scores on the latent factors Assessment purposes, Assessment practices,
   and Differentiation, teachers with the profile of Enthusiastic assessors
   view assessment as more useful and use it more often to adapt their
   instruction than teachers with the profile of Unenthusiastic assessors.
   This can be useful for practice and sheds more light on French teachers'
   assessment practices in mathematics. It is also interesting to compare
   the results of this survey with those from China and the Netherlands, as
   the differences reflect different assessment cultures and may shed light
   on some of the results of international large-scale assessments such as
   PISA.},

Abstract = {This study describes how 24 third graders (8-9 years old) relate and
   represent the relationships between variables when working with a
   functional thinking problem. This aspect contributes to providing
   insights about how elementary school students attend properties and
   relationships between covarying quantities rather than isolated
   computations. From a functional approach to early algebra, we describe
   written students' answers when working with a problem that involves a
   function, which includes questions for specific values and to
   generalize. Design research guidelines, specifically those set out for
   Classroom Teaching Experiment were followed. This study addresses the
   fourth and last Classroom Teaching Experiment session, which involved a
   function of the type y = ax + b and students had not previously worked
   it. Students primarily evidenced correspondence relationship, using
   natural language and numerical representation to express this functional
   relationship. Our findings let us to state that (a) although students
   were not used to working with these types of problems, eleven of them go
   beyond arithmetic computations, finding relationships that relate the
   variables; and (b) three students generalized using natural language as
   a useful vehicle, while there are other students who perceived the same
   regularity for different specific values but they are unable to
   represent generalization clearly.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on connections between linear functions and their
   graphs that were made by tertiary remedial algebra students. In
   particular, we describe students' work on a Task designed to examine the
   connection between points on a graph and the equation of a line. The
   data consist of 63 responses to a written questionnaire and individual
   interviews with three participants. The results indicate that visual
   approaches impede students' solutions and point to incomplete
   connections between algebraic and graphical representation. While
   algebraic approaches point to various connections used in approaching
   the Task, students' ability to work with algebraic representation did
   not necessarily result in capitalizing on these connections.
   Furthermore, interpretations of the graph based on visual inspection
   appeared most useful when used in support of the algebraic approach.},

Abstract = {In this study, students enrolled in a basic physics class participated
   in one of the online citizen science projects available on the
   Zooniverse website (www.zooniverse.org) as a homework assignment. They
   then wrote a 300-500-word reflection about their experience addressing
   several questions given as prompts. The analysis of the responses showed
   that a majority of the students enjoyed the experience saying that it
   was interesting, fun, and accessible. Many responses described a part of
   their science ideas that were either confirmed or changed by the
   experience. The science ideas included statements about looking for
   correlations among many data, the need to observe these data in order to
   find correlations, and the inherent uncertainty of the task and the data
   themselves. The ideas about science and scientific research expressed
   were in line with a competent view of science (Lederman, Handbook of
   Research on Science Education, 2, 831-879, Lederman, 2007; McComas et
   al., Science \& Education, 7(6), 511-532, McComas, Almazroa \& Clough,
   1998). The insight given by this study is that participation in a
   citizen science project can be educationally beneficial in learning
   about aspects of the nature of science.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors describe critical issues related to the
   pursuit of rigorous and innovative research in the fields of mathematics
   and science education. The paper is framed to help researchers consider
   aspects of both their research project and their research proposal. The
   authors describe features of high-quality and fundable research projects
   and whether the research is intended to support descriptive,
   design-oriented, or causal interpretation. They discuss the critical
   role of grounding proposed research in existing literatures; attending
   to relevant research from associated fields; and posing research
   questions that are clear, specific, and feasibly addressable. The goals
   of the research should cohere with the methodological and analytic
   design proposed. The authors also discuss the multidisciplinary nature
   of research that has implications for practice in general and for
   educational practice more specifically. The authors touch on the
   characteristics of more and less successful interdisciplinary research
   teams, especially those that draw from education, cognitive science,
   methodology, educational psychology, the learning sciences, and relevant
   STEM disciplinary fields. Examples of STEM education research questions
   from different genres of research are considered and the authors
   describe how the questions themselves give rise to specific design
   choices, methodologies, measures, study samples, and analytical models
   as well as how they can reflect the disciplinary orientations of the
   researchers. Implications of these issues for successful educational
   research grant proposal writing are discussed.},

Title = {Relationship among High School Students' Science Academic Hardiness,
   Conceptions of Learning Science and Science Learning Self-Efficacy in
   Singapore},

Abstract = {This study used three previously validated instruments, namely Science
   Academic Hardiness (SAH), Students' Conceptions of Learning Science
   (COLS) and Science Learning Self-Efficacy (SLSE) on 431 Singaporean
   students. Using structural equation modeling, results showed that the
   SAH commitment dimension a positive predictor explaining both the
   reproductive (e.g. science learning as memorizing or testing) and
   constructivist (e.g. science learning as understanding or seeing in a
   new way) conceptions of science learning as well as all dimensions of
   students' self-efficacy among high school students. It was also found
   that the SAH control dimension is a positive predictor for explaining
   the SLSE science communication dimension but is a negative predictor for
   explaining reproductive COLS. Finally, only students with constructivist
   COLS had significant associations with all SLSE dimensions. These
   findings suggest that students' personal commitment to learning science
   is an important aspect to cultivate since it has the ability to predict
   conceptions of science learning and self-efficacy. Further, creating
   opportunities for students to be engaged in learning through
   constructivist ways-such as designing tasks to help students understand
   and see phenomena in new ways and occasions for students to apply their
   science knowledge to solve science problems-is likely to lead to
   positive self-efficacy in practical science work, science communication,
   and everyday applications of scientific knowledge. Additionally,
   students' engagement in reproductive ways of learning science-such as
   memorization, testing, and calculating and practicing-could be reduced
   since these do not contribute to building students' science learning
   self-efficacy.},

Title = {Professional Development Through STEM Integration: How Early Career Math

Abstract = {Teachers often struggle to utilize reform-based teaching strategies in
   their first few years of teaching for many reasons (Ball, Thames \&
   Phelps, Journal of Teacher Education 59, 389-407, 2008; Berlin \& White,
   International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education 8, 97-115,
   2010; Frykholm \& Glasson, School Science and Mathematics 105, 127-141,
   2005; Lederman \& Lederman, Science Teacher Education 24, 1237-1240,
   2013). An important part of teachers' learning to implement these
   pedagogically ambitious strategies is for teachers to experience
   learning themselves through an immersive experience in the new strategy
   (Louks-Horsley, Stiles, Mundry, Love \& Hewson, Designing professional
   development for teachers of science and mathematics, 2010). Building on
   this body of research and a host of recent national education standards
   documents, this paper explores the various dispositions early career
   high school science and math teachers from across the USA demonstrate
   when engaging together as learners in integrated science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM) tasks. Embedded within a multi-year
   professional development program, teachers were engaged in two
   integrated STEM tasks during two separate professional development
   experiences. Following the tasks, teachers responded to writing prompts
   asking them to reflect on their experience during the tasks. Analysis of
   the reflections about the integrated STEM tasks fell into two broad
   categories of dispositions: engager and observer. The data suggest
   various strategies for professional development providers who are
   interested in providing professional development focused on integrated
   STEM instruction.},

Abstract = {A diagnostic study is presented of the prior experiences, conceptions,
   and pedagogical valuations of prospective primary teachers (PPTs) about
   experimental activities (ExA's) in science education. The participants
   were 121 PPTs who, in small teams, responded to various questions
   related to ExA. Their responses were analysed interpretively with inter-
   and intra-rater analysis methods. Low-inference descriptors were used to
   guarantee objectivity. The results showed the PPTs to hold conceptions
   and pedagogical valuations that were in general quite clearly aligned
   with the traditional approaches to ExA (absence of an inquiry-based
   approach, prevalence of conceptual learning, systematic implementation
   of a cookbook-based approach, etc.). The implications deriving from the
   results are discussed, with the ultimate aim being to contribute to the
   development of a well-founded teacher education plan including the
   routine integration of ExA into primary science education.},

Abstract = {This study examined changes in middle school teachers' beliefs about
   inquiry, implementation of inquiry practices, and self-efficacy to teach
   science through inquiry after participating in a year-long professional
   development program. The professional development model design was based
   on Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory of learning and literature
   on effective professional development. Using the Electronic Quality of
   Inquiry Protocol (EQUIP) before and after the program (Marshall, Smart
   \& Horton, 2010), teachers' quality of inquiry instruction significantly
   increased across all 4 EQUIP factors. To assess teachers' inquiry
   teaching efficacy, the Teaching Science as Inquiry (TSI; Dira-Smolleck,
   2004) instrument was administered 3 times to the teacher participants.
   Changes between time points of TSI administration were examined for
   personal self-efficacy and outcome expectancy across 5 essential
   features of classroom inquiry. Findings for the personal self-efficacy
   scale showed statistically significant gains from pre-Institute to
   1-year follow-up for all 5 inquiry features. Teachers' outcome
   expectancy beliefs significantly increased across the program for 3 of
   the 5 essential features of inquiry. The results indicate the
   effectiveness of the professional development model at increasing the
   participants' inquiry efficacy as well as the quality of their inquiry
   instruction. Our study provides evidence to support the need to include
   collaborative practice-teaching and reflection opportunities within
   professional development models that aim to increase teachers' use of
   inquiry-based instructional strategies.},

Abstract = {Integrated curricula have become a major educational focus in Korea.
   Policy changes began in 2009 when the Korea Ministry of Education,
   Science, and Technology announced a new curriculum incorporating
   Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM). Various
   stages of educational reform have occurred since that time. This study
   represents the first opportunity for readers of English-language
   journals to learn about these changes. The aims of the current study are
   to demonstrate the potential for engaging elementary school pre-service
   teachers in development of STEAM lesson plans within a science methods
   course and to elucidate the challenges in this instructional approach.
   Participants were 119 elementary pre-service teachers in their third
   year of study at a national university in Korea. Results show that
   developing STEAM lesson plans had a positive influence on elementary
   pre-service teachers' attitudes toward STEAM. Specifically, we found
   significant improvement on a pre-post survey for participants'
   awareness, perceived ability, value, and commitment for STEAM. Secondly,
   qualitative coding analysis of open-ended surveys revealed pre-service
   teachers' views of the potential benefits and challenges of developing
   STEAM lesson plans. Finally, we provide a rubric for evaluating
   pre-service teachers' STEAM lesson plans, based on our experience with
   teaching this skill within a science methods course.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {One way to fascinate, engage, arouse curiosity, motivate, and stimulate
   intellectual development in learning scientific concepts is to use
   counterintuitive questions. These questions make students aware of the
   inadequacies of their own thinking by exposing them to situations whose
   outcomes are inconsistent with what they would expect. In this study, a
   counterintuitive dynamics test (CIDT) is developed and administered to
   high school students along with the force concept inventory (FCI). After
   expert reviews, the initial version of the test consisting of 39
   questions was administered to 87 students as a pilot study. After item
   analysis, a final version of 30 questions was developed; its internal
   consistency reliability coefficient was calculated as 0.826. The CIDT
   and FCI were administered to 229 students from 9 different high schools
   in Turkey. The results indicated that while in FCI students were mostly
   affected by everyday experiences and while in CIDT by carelessness and a
   superficial approach. Average scores for both tests were roughly equal
   and low. The results showed that the CIDT is a new test that measures
   another dimension of dynamic concepts and should be used along with the
   FCI.},

Abstract = {Conflicting explanations and unrelated information in science classrooms
   increase cognitive load and decrease efficiency in learning. This
   reduced efficiency ultimately limits one's ability to solve reasoning
   problems in the science. In reasoning, it is the ability of students to
   sift through and identify critical pieces of information that is of
   paramount importance in science and learning. Unfortunately, the ability
   to accomplish the identification of critical ideas is not one that
   develops without practice and assistance form teachers or tutors in the
   classroom. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the application
   of an evolutionary algorithm works within a cognitive computational
   model to solve problems in the science classroom and simulate human
   reasoning for research purposes. The research question is: does the
   combination of optimization algorithms and cognitive computational
   algorithms successfully mimic biological teaching and learning systems
   in the science classroom? Within this computational study, the author
   outlines and simulates the effects of teaching and learning on the
   ability of a ``virtual{''} student to solve a science task. Using the
   STAC-M computational model the author completes a computational
   experiment that examines the role of cognitive retraining on student
   learning. The author also discusses the important limitations of this
   powerful new tool.},

Abstract = {Previous results show that Swedish upper secondary school teachers
   attribute gender to cases describing different types of mathematical
   reasoning. The purpose of this study was to investigate how these
   teachers gender stereotype aspects of students' mathematical reasoning
   by studying the symbols that were attributed to boys and girls,
   respectively, in a written questionnaire. The results from the content
   analysis showed that girls were attributed gender symbols including
   insecurity, use of standard methods and imitative reasoning, and boys
   were assigned symbols such as multiple strategies especially on the
   calculator, guessing and chance-taking.},

Abstract = {This study explored the effects of arguing to learn in a socioscientific
   context on the fundamental and derived components of reading, writing,
   and science understanding as integral parts of science literacy. We
   adopted mixed-methods in which the 1-group pretest-posttest design with
   supplemental interviews and questionnaires. The pretest evaluated the
   dependent variables (reading and writing scores), the treatment was
   arguing to learn about the global climate change issue, the posttest
   evaluated the dependent variables, and follow-up questionnaires and
   interviews informed the quantitative results. An intact grade six class
   (N = 28) at an urban elementary school located in central Taiwan was the
   participants. Analyses of the pretest-posttest gain scores and
   correlations between these outcomes revealed significant (p < 0.05)
   improvements in writing and associations among reading, writing, and
   arguing to learn. Interpretation of the qualitative data (interview and
   questionnaire responses) supported that argumentation as an
   instructional treatment focused on fundamental literacy could play a
   positive role in facilitating students' enhanced science understanding
   (derived literacy).},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
   both 9th-grade and 1st-year undergraduate students' use of ``look
   back{''} strategies and problem solving performance in multiple solution
   methods, the difference in their use of look back strategies and problem
   solving performance in multiple solution methods, and the role of look
   back strategies in problem solving in multiple solution methods. Data
   for this study were comprised of 30 9th-grade and 30 1st-year
   undergraduate students' problem solving scores in multiple solution
   methods and their think-aloud protocols. Based on and expanded from
   Polya's (1973) ideas, ``look back{''} in the present study means
   ``examination of what was done or learned previously.{''} The results of
   this study indicated that both the 9th-grade and 1st-year undergraduate
   students who looked back more frequently tended to perform better in
   multiple solution methods, the 1st-year undergraduate students tended to
   look back more frequently and perform better than the 9th-grade students
   in multiple solution methods, and both the 9th-grade and 1st-year
   undergraduate students tended to review and to compare multiple solution
   methods in their use of look back strategies.},

   the first interview, Leo was asked to share with us the stories behind
   some problems posed by him in the past. In the second interview, he was
   asked to pose a new competition problem in a thinking-aloud mode. We
   found that Leo's pool of familiar problems is organized in classes
   according to certain nesting ideas. Furthermore, these nesting ideas
   serve him in posing problems that, ideally, are perceived by Leo as
   novel and surprising not only to potential solvers, but also to himself.
   Because of the lack of empirical research on experts in mathematical
   problem posing, the findings are discussed in light of research on
   experts in problem solving and on novices in mathematical problem
   posing.},

Abstract = {This study presents a typology of continuing professional development
   (CPD) activities and provides a discussion related to each. The typology
   includes 2 main themes, which investigate the various types of
   activities and the content presented in CPD programmes. The study used
   qualitative methods (open-ended questionnaires in addition to
   semi-structured interviews) with Saudi Arabian science teachers. The
   main theoretical framework for this study centres on the
   socio-constructivist theory of learning. Discussion of the findings
   leads to a depiction of what science teachers `need' to learn and `how'
   they want to learn. The aim of this study is to provide a framework for
   socio-constructivist science teacher professional development based on
   an attempt to understand how teachers learn effectively in CPD
   programmes and what science teachers need to learn.},

Abstract = {Evolution continues to be a controversial topic around the world but
   nowhere is this more apparent locally than in the Southeastern region of
   the USA. In this study, we explored acceptance and rejection of
   evolution among pre-service science teachers in a teaching college in
   the rural Southeast and sought to determine (1) what relationships exist
   between the worldview variables and acceptance of evolution among
   pre-service secondary science teachers? and (2) Which combination of
   these variables explains the most statistically significant amount of
   variance in acceptance of evolution among pre-service secondary science
   teachers? Regression analysis was used to determine the best-fit model
   predicting levels of acceptance in this sample, explaining 45 \% of
   variance in acceptance of evolution in 4 variables. The result of this
   study sheds light on possible remediation for low acceptance of
   evolution and directions for improved preparation of future science
   teachers relative to teaching and learning evolution.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-based assessment for
   elementary school students' listening comprehension of science talk
   within an inquiry-oriented environment. The development procedure had 3
   steps: a literature review to define the framework of the test,
   collecting and identifying key constructs of science talk, and
   developing and verifying an instrument that measured listening
   comprehension of science talk. The Science Listening Comprehension Test
   (SLCT), consisting of 35 multiple-choice items, was developed for 3
   science inquiry components: identifying questions, designing methods and
   presenting evidence, and drawing evidence-based conclusions. Students
   from grades 4 and 6 (N = 1,080) were recruited and selected through
   cluster sampling. The SLCT's validity, reliability, and item parameters
   were found to be reasonable. Grade-related improvement in listening
   comprehension of science talk was observed, no significant gender
   difference was observed, and students' listening comprehension of
   science talk was predictable with prior scientific knowledge and
   language ability measures. Instructional implications were discussed,
   and future research was outlined.},

   DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SECTORS AND GENDERS IN THE ISRAELI CONTEXT},

Abstract = {The present research is part of a longitude research study regarding the
   questioning behavior of students in the inquiry chemistry laboratory in
   Israel. We found that students who were involved in learning chemistry
   by the inquiry method ask more and higher-level questions. However,
   throughout the years, we have observed that differences between the two
   groups of students, control and the inquiry, have been reduced. The
   results of our study indicated that the gap between the Jewish and Arab
   students regarding their questioning ability is minor and inconsistent.
   If we assume that the source of this difference lies in the culture and
   different standards for teachers' qualifications in the two sectors, our
   current results suggested that the differences between chemistry
   teachers in the two sectors are now diminished. Teachers from both
   sectors utilized the inquiry program as part of their teaching
   repertoire, and the students in the two sectors learned the inquiry
   skill of asking questions.},

Title = {AN ACTOR-ORIENTED TRANSFER PERSPECTIVE ON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS'
   DEVELOPMENT OF THE USE OF PROCEDURES TO SOLVE PROBLEMS ON RATE OF CHANGE},

Abstract = {This article reports on a longitudinal observation study about students'
   development in their use of procedures to calculate instantaneous rate
   of change. Different procedures for solving tasks on rate of change are
   taught in mathematics and physics classes, and together they form a
   repertoire. Our study took an actor-oriented perspective, which we
   operationalized as a search for students' personal constructions of
   relationships between (1) learning from mathematics and physics classes
   and (2) interview tasks. We followed 10 students for 2 years (from grade
   10 to 12), during which we administered 4 task-based interviews. We
   analyzed the breadth and connectedness of students' repertoire of
   procedures and report on the long-term development thereof. We conclude
   that often procedures are not part of students' repertoire shortly after
   the first introduction of this procedure in class. Students need time to
   acquire single procedures, and much more time to develop a broad and
   connected repertoire. In the development of their repertoire, there are
   major differences between students. From an actor-oriented perspective,
   many personal constructions are visible between learning and interview
   tasks. Students often use procedures that differ from procedures that
   are most appropriate from an expert's perspective. We also observed from
   an actor-oriented perspective that words such as velocity, steepness, or
   slope act as bridge for creating relationships between situations and
   procedures.},

Abstract = {This study used phenomenography, a qualitative method, to investigate
   Taiwanese mathematics teachers' conceptions of school mathematics,
   school statistics, and their differences. To collect data, we
   interviewed five mathematics teachers by open questions. They also
   responded to statements drawn on mathematical/statistical conceptions
   and epistemological beliefs in the literature. We also conducted a
   survey of 22 mathematics teachers who responded to open-ended questions
   for comparing and justifying the findings from the interview data. We
   found that the characteristic features of the categories and dimensions
   of these teachers' conceptions were different from those in the relevant
   literature. All of the mathematics teachers' conceptions of school
   mathematics, school statistics, and their differences could be
   identified by these categories and dimensions as reflected by their
   characteristic features. We discuss our findings and their implications
   for further research and teacher education programs.},

Abstract = {In this mixed-methods study, the effect of training teacher-researchers
   in a collaborative research environment is examined for a cohort of
   teachers enrolled in a Math and Science Partnership (MSP) master's
   degree program. The teachers describe changes in their research views
   and in their application of research in practice, and detail the
   challenges they faced during the process. The findings of the study
   suggest training teachers as researchers is likely to encourage teacher
   interest in conducting and applying theory in math and science
   classrooms. The results of this study have implications for bridging the
   gap between theory and practice in math and science education in
   general.},

Title = {A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL INSTRUMENT FOR EVALUATING TAIWANESE HIGH SCHOOL

Abstract = {In the past, students' science learning self-efficacy (SLSE) was usually
   measured by questionnaires that consisted of only a single scale, which
   might be insufficient to fully understand their SLSE. In this study, a
   multi-dimensional instrument, the SLSE instrument, was developed and
   validated to assess students' SLSE based on the previous literature.
   Besides, the interrelations between students' approaches to learning
   science and SLSE were explored. A total of 311 Taiwanese eighth graders
   were invited to respond to the SLSE instrument and the Approaches to
   Learning Science (ALS) questionnaire. After ensuring several types of
   validity (e.g. construct validity and criterion-related validity) and
   the reliability of the SLSE questionnaire, the results suggested that
   the SLSE instrument should have satisfactory validity and reliability to
   measure Taiwanese eighth graders' SLSE in terms of 5 dimensions:
   Conceptual Understanding, Higher-Order Cognitive Skills, Practical Work,
   Everyday Application, and Science Communication. Moreover, through
   Pearson correlation analyses, the results revealed that the Taiwanese
   eighth graders who perceived themselves as having a deep motive, along
   with the orientation of surface motive, tended to report higher SLSE.
   Also, those students who reported adopting deep strategies to learn
   science were more likely to possess higher SLSE. The regression results
   indicated that, overall, the students' deep strategies and deep motive
   were strong predictors of their SLSE, particularly for the Higher-Order
   Thinking Skills SLSE. Yet, the Practical Work SLSE could only be
   predicted by the Deep Strategy dimension of ALS.},

Abstract = {The activity of reasoning-and-proving is at the heart of mathematical
   sense making and is important for all students' learning as early as the
   elementary grades. Yet, reasoning-and-proving tends to have a marginal
   place in elementary school classrooms. This situation can be partly
   attributed to the fact that many (prospective) elementary teachers have
   (1) weak mathematical (subject matter) knowledge about
   reasoning-and-proving and (2) counterproductive beliefs about its
   teaching. Following up on an intervention study that helped a group of
   prospective elementary teachers make significant progress in overcoming
   these two major obstacles to teaching reasoning-and-proving, we examined
   the challenges that three of them identified that they faced as they
   planned and taught lessons related to reasoning-and-proving in their
   mentor teachers' classrooms. Our findings contribute to research
   knowledge about major factors (other than the well-known factors related
   to teachers' mathematical knowledge and beliefs) that deserve attention
   by teacher education programs in preparing prospective teachers to teach
   reasoning-and-proving.},

Abstract = {Upper secondary students' task solving reasoning was analysed with a
   focus on arguments for strategy choices and conclusions. Passages in
   their arguments for reasoning that indicated the students' beliefs were
   identified and, by using a thematic analysis, categorized. The results
   stress three themes of beliefs used as arguments for central decisions:
   safety, expectations and motivation. Arguments such as `I don't trust my
   own reasoning', `mathematical tasks should be solved in a specific way'
   and `using this specific algorithm is the only way for me to solve this
   problem' exemplify these three themes. These themes of beliefs seem to
   interplay with each other, for instance in students' strategy choices
   when solving mathematical tasks.},

Abstract = {There is growing research interest in the challenges and opportunities
   learners face in representing scientific understandings, processes and
   reasoning. These challenges include integrating verbal, visual and
   mathematical modes in science discourse to make strong conceptual links
   between representations and classroom experiences. Our paper reports on
   a project that aimed to identify practical and theoretical issues
   entailed in a representation-intensive approach to guiding students'
   conceptual learning in science. We focus here on a teacher developing
   students' understanding of the formation of ions and molecules. We argue
   that the representations produced by students in this process met the
   criteria for representational competence proposed by diSessa (Cognition
   and Instruction, 22, 293-331, 2004) and Kozma \& Russell (2005). The
   students understood that an effective representation needed to show
   relevant information, focus on pertinent points, be self-sufficient in
   its claims about the topic and provide coherent links between different
   parts of the representation. The final activity showed that their
   representations reached Kozma \& Russell's (2005) highest level of
   competence, where the students were able to use specific features of
   their representations to critique their suitability for explaining
   bonding and were able to show how their representation linked to the
   periodic table as a representation. We conclude by considering the
   implications of these findings.},

Abstract = {With recognition of the importance of scientific literacy for the nation
   and yet the increasing students' disinterest in science through school
   science curriculum, the Korea Science Foundation launched an innovative
   program called `Everyday Science Class (ESC)' in partnership with
   universities and local government offices in 2003. In this work, we
   introduce the structure and dynamics of the ESC program in K-district
   through examining (1) how everyday contexts helped learners' perceptions
   and attitudes toward science and (2) how the dynamics of learning
   environments effected learners' learning process. We employed interviews
   and video recording of classes for data collection. To analyze the data,
   we used the process of thematic coding to understand the outcomes and
   effects of ESC program. The research findings showed that everyday
   context and a unique environment of learning with parents in the ESC
   program could bring forth learners' understandings on the connection
   between science and their everyday lives and positive attitudes toward
   science learning. We also found that there were certain issues to be
   taken into account in terms of children's cognitive development for
   further development.},

   skills; conceptual skills; and professional skills. Although some
   students held clear ideas about the role of mathematics, many were not
   able to articulate how it would be used in their future. This has

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the impacts of contextual factors on the
   use of students' conceptions. A total of 106 students received a
   questionnaire involving open-ended questions on acid-base and
   equilibrium concepts. Of these students, 16 students who provided
   complete and accurate responses to the questions participated in an
   interview. In order to observe the effects of different contexts, in the
   interview, the conception of acid-base was probed in an equilibrium
   system. As a result, the students' utterances indicated that (1) a
   specific problem situation could activate a different part(s) of a
   concept image, (2) an evoked concept image perfectly working in a
   particular context could become inadequate in a broader one, and (3) a
   misconception that could not be observed in a particular context might
   surface itself in a different one. The results further pointed to the
   fact that our current definitions and descriptions for acids and bases
   could be one of the sources of these misconceptions.},

Abstract = {Current initiatives in science education in Korea have emphasized
   science literacy as the most important purpose of science education;
   that is, science education needs to focus on helping each student to
   become a scientifically literate person who is able to make reasoned
   decisions. In attempting to address this focus concern about science
   literacy, the researchers of this study attempted to implement the
   Science Writing Heuristic (SWH) approach and examined both the SWH and
   the control groups using the modified Reformed Teaching Observation
   Protocol (RTOP). Students' performance on a Summary Writing Test (SWT)
   was also examined. Participant students of this study were eighth grade
   students in three middle schools located in the second biggest city in
   Korea. Each of the three teachers from three schools taught both the SWH
   and the control classes. The results of this study showed significant
   differences between the SWH and the control groups on the SWT. There was
   a difference in the total RTOP scores between the SWH and the control
   groups. Differences among schools imply that higher level of teachers'
   implementation of the SWH approach would appear to result in better
   student achievement.},

Abstract = {The study identified two dimensions of teacher self-efficacy and
   practices and five dimensions of students' mathematics self-efficacy and
   sought to determine the extent to which teacher characteristics and
   practices can enhance secondary school students' self-efficacy. Data
   were collected from 13,173 students in 193 teachers' classrooms from 141
   schools in the 10 districts of Lake Victoria Region of Kenya. Two-level
   hierarchical linear model revealed that teachers' frequent use of
   mathematics homework, their level of interest and enjoyment of
   mathematics, as well as their ability and competence in teaching
   mathematics were found to play a key role in promoting students'
   mathematics self-efficacy. Teachers' ability and competence in teaching
   were also found to be effective in narrowing the gender gap in students'
   self-confidence and competence in mathematics. The study recommends that
   teacher training colleges emphasize such teacher practices and values in
   order to enhance students' mathematics self-efficacy, reduce their level
   of anxiety and fear of mathematics, and consequently, enhance their
   achievement in mathematics. Professional development opportunities
   should also be made available to in-service teachers to continually
   update their knowledge and skills and develop new strategies for teacher
   effectiveness.},

   verification type labs (VTL) and to gain an understanding of the role of
   MBL in promoting mathematization. The study was conducted in 2 grade 11
   classes in which students studied Hooke's law and Newton's second law of
   motion using MBL during 1 year while a different group of students
   studied the same topics with the same physics teacher using a VTL
   approach. All sessions were videotaped, transcribed and coded using a
   taxonomy developed by DeVito \& Grotzer (2005). In addition, evidence to
   support each of the 5 steps of mathematization was sought from the
   actions of the teachers and their discourse with the students. Results
   showed that conceptual knowledge type utterances were significantly more
   frequent in MBL sessions, cognitive processes of remembering and
   understanding were significantly more frequent in the MBL sessions,
   students spent most of their time analyzing the graphs in the MBL
   sessions, and MBL has a potential to promote mathematization in
   favorable instructional environments in physics laboratory classes.},

Title = {GENDER DIFFERENCES IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TAIWANESE ADOLESCENTS'

Abstract = {This study explored gender differences in the relationship between young
   people's mathematics attitudes and their perceptions toward virtual
   manipulatives. Seven hundred eighty junior high school adolescents who
   participated in the problem-solving activity using virtual manipulatives
   were selected for examination. The study found the male adolescents'
   views on motivation and enjoyment of mathematics could explain many
   aspects of their perceptions toward virtual manipulatives. The female
   adolescents' views on the importance of mathematics and freedom from
   fear of mathematics could explain many aspects of their perceptions
   toward virtual manipulatives. However, motivation, enjoyment, and
   importance of mathematics were more prominent than freedom from fear of
   mathematics in predicting male adolescents' perceptions toward virtual
   manipulatives, and freedom from fear and importance of mathematics were
   more prominent than enjoyment and motivation of mathematics in
   predicting female adolescents' perceptions toward virtual manipulatives.
   Two implications can be drawn from this study. First, teachers could
   provide males with appealing problem contexts not only to be used to
   remove the fear of mathematics, but also to be used for enjoyment and as
   motivation to see the importance of mathematics. Then male students
   could be encouraged to have more confirmed positive perceptions toward
   virtual manipulatives when engaging in the activities of computer-based
   mathematics. Second, teachers could provide females with interesting
   teaching activities, not only to be used for motivation and the
   enjoyment of mathematics, but also to be used to remove the fear of
   mathematics and for experiencing the importance of mathematics. Then
   female students could have positive perceptions toward virtual
   manipulatives when technology was integrated into the classroom to
   enhance learning and to support effective mathematics teaching.},

Abstract = {This special edition of IJMSE focuses on the Programme of International
   Student Assessment (PISA) project now that it has completed a full cycle
   of administration-reading, mathematics, and science-to look at ways in
   which PISA has been used in participating countries and with what
   consequences, and to identify potential research and policy directions
   emanating from this initiative. Articles were invited to (a) reflect
   international perspectives on the uses and consequences of PISA to date
   and (b) speculate on future directions for research, curriculum, and
   policy using the PISA datasets. The introductory article provides a
   brief overview of common aspects of PISA: Evolving definitions of
   reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy; technical
   design of the instruments and data analysis procedures; the changing
   emphasis of administrations; and recent research using the datasets.
   PISA, unlike other international assessments in reading, mathematics,
   and science, has provided a fresh perspective on `what might be' by
   decoupling the assessment from mandated curricula to focus on literacies
   needed for a 21st century economy. This unique feature of PISA brings
   with it possibilities and cautions for policy makers.},

Abstract = {This study examined number sense strategies and misconceptions of 280
   Taiwanese pre-service elementary teachers who responded to a series of
   real-life problems. About one-fifth of the pre-service teachers applied
   number sense-based strategies (such as using benchmarks appropriately or
   recognizing the number magnitude) while a majority of pre-service
   teachers relied on rule-based methods. This finding is consistent with
   earlier studies in Taiwan that fifth, sixth, and eighth grade students
   tended to rely heavily on written methods rather than using number
   sense-based strategies. This study documents that the performance of
   pre-service elementary teachers on number sense is low. If we want to
   improve elementary students' knowledge and use of number sense, then
   action should be taken to improve the level of their future teachers'
   number sense.},

   Singapore, where students engaged in a mathematics modeling task while
   learning the four pillars of CT. To investigate the impact of
   integrating CT dispositions on student engagement and mathematics
   performance, a one-group posttest design together with a survey was
   administered. Mixed research methods were employed. Structural Equation
   Modeling analysis revealed that CT dispositions could enhance students'
   mathematics performance by fostering greater engagement in math,
   although a direct effect of CT disposition on mathematics performance
   was not observed. Additionally, interviews with students highlighted
   their positive dispositions towards CT, including a sense of capability,
   inclination, and sensitivity in utilizing CT for the modeling task and
   other contexts.},

Abstract = {This study used fraction number line estimation tasks to evaluate
   students' developmental patterns, and the relationship of such tasks
   with whole number bias was explored. In total, 189 fourth-grade students
   in a northern Taiwan elementary school were followed over 2 years. The
   results demonstrated that the students' fraction learning development
   pattern progressed from being nonlinear to linear, and none of the
   students' estimations exhibited a logarithmic pattern, as was the case
   in positive-integer number line estimation tasks. Many of the
   fourth-grade students (41.3\%) did not exhibit a linear pattern of
   estimation and had clear whole number bias. By the fifth grade, half of
   these students still had a nonlinear pattern and could not treat
   fractions as integrated numbers. Instead, they were affected by whole
   number bias and mistakenly used the denominator to judge the actual
   fraction value.},

Abstract = {It is important for students to develop a relational understanding of
   the equal sign, but students often have simultaneous operational and
   relational conceptions (i.e., SOR conceptions). This case study
   carefully explored how a student's conception of the equal sign changed
   during a classroom teaching experiment and analyzed the possibilities
   and difficulties in developing the student's conception of the equal
   sign. At first, the student demonstrated her understanding of only those
   equations in the form a +/- b = c by using the operational conception of
   the equal sign. Given an unfamiliar equation in the form a +/- b = c +/-
   d=e, the student revealed the relational conception but still evaluated
   an incorrect equation as correct using the operational conception. Her
   SOR conception did not change easily despite considerable classroom
   discussion. When the teacher explained the meaning of the equal sign and
   connected it with a pan balance, the student understood the meaning of
   quantitative sameness of the equal sign and showed a stable relational
   conception. Later, in equations of the form a +/- b = c +/- d, the
   student's conception progressed to the comparative relational
   conception. Given the progression, this study focused on the noticeable
   shifts in the student's conceptions of the equal sign, and this article
   discusses both theoretical and pedagogical implications regarding
   students' conceptions of the equal sign.},

Abstract = {Currently, the physics disciplines are represented by a significantly
   larger number of professional males, compared to females. Although the
   problem of underrepresentation of female physicists has several causes,
   one likely reason is the lower interest that female school students have
   in physics activities. Several instructional solutions have been
   proposed to spark girls' interest in physics, including recent ones with
   mobile devices. However, mobile devices could be problematic
   technologies for school students and teachers, particularly if guidance
   in their use is not provided. In the present study, we investigated the
   effectiveness of a novel mobile application guided with laboratory
   reports to increase high school students' interest in physics. We also
   investigated whether the intervention with mobile laboratory activities
   facilitated learning about an important physics topic, namely,
   understanding graphs. The study was conducted in eight eligible schools,
   totaling data from 268 high school students (57\% females). Results
   showed that all seven measures of self-rated interest in physics
   received higher scores in the posttest than in the pretest. One of the
   items, which assessed changes in understanding physics, showed greater
   effects on females than on males. Hence, the instructional mobile
   application under consideration helped to spark students' interest in
   physics, and the effect was somewhat greater in schoolgirls, but the
   intervention did not change the test scores about understanding graphs,
   failing to demonstrate an association between increased interest in
   physics and changes in physics educational outcomes. The instructional
   implications for these findings, as well as limitations and future
   research directions, are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this qualitative study, the researchers explored the ways in which
   21st-century skills (specifically communication and critical thinking)
   are enhanced by Grade 10 beginner Physical Sciences teachers while
   teaching Particulate Nature of Matter (PNM) through the implementation
   of problem-based learning (PBL). The study was conducted in one of the
   four educational districts of the North West province, South Africa. The
   district was selected due to its geographical proximity and
   accessibility to the researchers. Two participants were purposively
   selected from two rural government secondary schools. Research
   instruments for the study comprised an open-ended questionnaire and a
   reflective portfolio. The data were analyzed manually using Saldana's
   model and Smith et al.'s assessment rubric. The findings show that PBL
   enhances communication and critical thinking skills. It is recommended
   that a teacher professional development (TPD) training program be
   presented for beginner Physical Sciences teachers which targets the
   formulation of PBL problems, the promotion of 21st-century skills
   (communication and critical thinking), and the implementation of PBL in
   other topics in Chemistry.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to characterise how pre-service
   kindergarten teachers used a Hypothetical Learning Trajectory on length
   and its measurement to notice children's mathematical thinking. A total
   of 64 pre-service kindergarten teachers enrolled in an Early Years
   Education mathematics teaching course were asked to notice teaching
   situations focusing on kindergarten children's learning of length. On
   the one hand, three profiles of pre-service kindergarten teachers were
   found according to the use they made of the Hypothetical Learning
   Trajectory. These profiles were characterised by three ways of learning
   to use the Hypothetical Learning Trajectory based on the type of
   mathematical elements they identified: only mathematical elements
   related to the magnitude; only mathematical elements related to the
   measurement of length; or both magnitude and measurement elements. On
   the other hand, when considering the three skills of professional
   noticing, by identifying the mathematical elements required to solve the
   proposed task, a group of pre-service kindergarten teachers within each
   profile were able to notice the thinking of these elements by children
   and to suggest activities. Our findings provide learning opportunities
   to pre-service kindergarten teachers who use a Hypothetical Learning
   Trajectory. It provides them with `check-points' to answer the proposed
   questions, in order to learn the specialised knowledge for teaching
   length and its measurement as well as to develop the skill of noticing
   student's mathematical thinking.},

Abstract = {This case study investigates, at three Swedish schools, primary school
   students' knowledge of the equal sign. The schools were chosen as
   representatives of schools whose students have different socioeconomic
   backgrounds. The data consist of Grade 3 and 6 students' responses to an
   assessment form based on Matthews et al. (JRME, 43(3):316-350, 2012). A
   comparison between the schools indicates that there are great
   differences in the students' knowledge of the equal sign depending on
   which school they attend. The Swedish students perform better than South
   Korean students responding to the same assessment form when it comes to
   knowing that the equal sign does not mean an operation ({''}the answer
   to a problem{''}). We find this interesting to discuss, as South Korea
   is one of the countries that performs the best on the TIMSS and PISA.},

Abstract = {In this qualitative study, we investigated teachers' use of proportional
   knowledge resources while being asked to appropriately identify if a
   given situation was proportional or not using clinical interview data
   from a large grant funded project. We found that knowledge resources
   related to the mathematical structure of the situation were most useful
   in correctly identifying the situation. Interestingly, teachers were
   often able to identify a mathematical expression for the situations;
   however, these rules did not support the correct identification of the
   situation as proportional or not. We discuss suggested knowledge
   resources for the creation of a coordination class for identifying
   situations that are proportional from those that are not as well as
   implications for teacher education and professional development around
   proportional reasoning.},

Abstract = {In science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM),
   hands-on making is the interplay of the sensuous forces of object-free
   and object-related intelligence transcendence in the continual process
   of quality improvement. The present research involved the design of a
   STEAM contest that focuses on having students use hand tools to produce
   three miniature models in the morning and then use these models to
   compete in relay races and tug-of-war contests in the afternoon. They
   were required to rely on their intelligence practice without the
   assistance of teachers or parents. Thus, this research aimed to explore
   the correlates between students' object-free (bodily-kinesthetic,
   spatial, logical) and object-related (naturalistic) intelligences, and
   their hands-on making self-efficacy (HMSE) reflected in their attitude
   toward quality improvement (ATQI) when participating in a STEAM contest.
   Data were collected from 330 junior high school students on the day of
   the STEAM competition and were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis
   with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the
   students' 4 types of multiple intelligences were positively related to
   HMSE. Consequently, HMSE was positively related to ATQI. The results
   imply that ATQI was essential for students to win in the STEAM contest,
   which benefited those students with a high level of the 4 types of
   intelligence mediated by HMSE.},

Abstract = {This paper suggests implications for researchable questions about
   mathematics teacher development. We ask the following: what is necessary
   for research that includes mathematics specialists or other hidden
   school-based roles within a project beyond classroom teachers and
   students? Mathematics specialists (e.g. mathematics coaches, mathematics
   teacher leaders) support teacher learning and development using
   different models of school-based professional development. They can play
   a critical role in connecting research and practice. However, research
   in mathematics education has regularly neglected to examine their role
   in studies of professional development. We suggest there are two needs
   for creating and examining researchable questions about such hidden
   players in studies of professional development: (1) defining practices
   and hidden players involved in systematic school change and (2)
   identifying the unit of analysis and scaling up professional
   development. We summarize existing studies and present considerations
   for future research.},

Abstract = {This qualitative research addresses the gap of studying the relationship
   between beliefs about assessment in mathematics and mathematics beliefs
   by identifying the (espoused) beliefs about assessment and their
   connections with the mathematical beliefs of 18 high school Mexican
   out-of-field mathematics teachers (i.e. teachers without formal training
   for teaching mathematics). Thematic analysis was used to analyze data
   gathered through semi-structured interviews. Results revealed that
   teachers' beliefs are organized in different clusters that connect their
   beliefs about mathematics and assessment in mathematics. Some specific
   mathematical beliefs and beliefs on assessment played a central role on
   the construction of these clusters (e.g. `mathematics is for
   applications'). There are two complementary reasons for the existence of
   these beliefs: the daily context of the participants and their condition
   of being out-the-field teachers with vocational training as engineers.},

Title = {The Effect of Social Dilemma on Flow Experience: Prosociality Relevant

Abstract = {According to social dilemma theory, students may be characterized as
   being indifferent to reciprocal behavior and disengaged from interacting
   with the board gaming process. Given a common goal, students'
   prosociality can affect the collective efficacy and goal achievement
   motivation that reflects their flow experience in a
   cooperative-competitive computer-based digital board game, called
   Strike-Up. The players were randomly provided with five numbers,
   addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division signs, and
   parentheses, and needed to complete the arithmetic calculation to find
   the best approaches to achieve the goal of reaching the end of the game.
   In addition to the cognitive strategies, the game allowed players to
   help each other to win. To explore the correlation, 240 students were
   randomly grouped into three-player teams to play Strike-Up against other
   teams. Data of 180 players were effectively returned and subjected to
   confirmatory analysis with structural equation modeling. The results
   revealed that prosociality can positively predict players' flow
   experience mediated positively by collective efficacy and
   performance-approach goal motivation. The results also implied that the
   higher level of prosociality students had, the higher level of flow
   state they experienced in the game which involved a social dilemma.},

Abstract = {An e-mentoring program was established to support females who were
   studying or intending to study or work in Science, Technology,
   Engineering or Maths related disciplines (STEM) and were located in
   regional, rural or remote areas. Mentors and mentees were matched based
   on their shared interests, fields of study and area of employment. The
   mentoring program aimed to support mentees' career development and
   smoother transitions from study into the workforce by providing an
   opportunity to develop knowledge and networks necessary to achieve their
   career goals. Data were collected through pre and post online surveys
   and semi-structured interviews. This paper describes the experiences of
   e-mentoring for participants located in rural and remote locations and
   shares implications for implementation of e-mentoring and suggestions
   for improvement for future e-mentoring projects.},

Title = {Multiple Appearances of Parental Interactions and Math Achievement on
   TIMSS International Assessment},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore the different appearances of parental
   interactions based on principal, teacher, and student reports of the 8th
   grade Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2011
   assessments in Israel and how the appearances of parental interactions
   relate to math achievements. We conducted a multilevel SEM on 147
   principals, 147 teachers, and 4304 students nested in 147 schools.
   Different appearances of parental interactions emerged such as
   ``parental involvement in student learning,{''} ``direct communication
   on student progress,{''} and ``providing general information of school
   principles and activities{''} based on student, teacher, and principal
   reports respectively. Significant negative relationships were found
   between these appearances that can be explained by compensation
   relationships. We found a positive relationship between student reports
   of parental involvement and student achievements. The negative
   relationships we found between teacher and principal reports of parental
   interactions and student achievements may reflect situations where
   teachers and principals interact with parents mostly in problematic
   cases. We also found that girls perceive their parents' involvement
   higher than boys, immigrant students had lower achievements than
   native-born students, and children whose parents have higher educational
   levels had higher achievements. While most studies examined parental
   interactions from the teacher's, student's, or principal's perspectives,
   this study is unique in that it applies an integrative approach that
   considers all the appearances simultaneously. Thus, this study leads to
   a broader view of parental interactions and can contribute to developing
   programs for encouraging parental interactions in school routines.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates Swedish preschool educators' emotional
   directions towards mathematics. A questionnaire was answered by 157
   preschool educators and their responses were analysed using both
   quantitative and qualitative methods. The majority of preschool
   educators stated that they are positive towards mathematics. Regarding
   the hypotheses that education or years of experience have a positive
   impact on how you feel about a subject, the statistical analysis did not
   confirm these hypotheses. However, the results from the qualitative
   analysis suggest that some preschool educators change their feelings
   towards mathematics with time, experience, more education and/or new
   setting such as a new curriculum. They expressed a dynamic view where
   they previously have been more negative towards mathematics but now are
   much more positive. Some implications are that compared with the
   reputation, preschool educators express more positive feelings, and that
   targeted education is a contributing factor.},

Abstract = {This study investigated preservice middle school mathematics teachers'
   (PSTs) understanding of proportional and nonproportional relationships
   and their abilities to differentiate these relationships from each
   other. The PSTs' abilities to interpret and represent proportional and
   nonproportional situations and solution strategies were also
   investigated. Forty PSTs who attended a mathematics education course on
   fractions, ratios, and proportions participated in the study. The data
   included the PSTs' written responses to four open-ended problems and
   semi-structured interviews conducted with six of the PSTs. The analysis
   of the data showed that the PSTs mostly attended to the simultaneous
   increases or decreases and constancy of the rate of change when
   determining relationships. The PSTs' over attention to these specific
   features constrained their understanding of the proportional and
   nonproportional relationships. Therefore, they had difficulty
   differentiating proportional relationships from nonproportional
   relationships even after instruction on these relationships. Moreover,
   some PSTs still identified nonproportional relationships as proportional
   after determining correct additive relationships. In addition, the PSTs
   had difficulty representing and interpreting proportional and
   nonproportional relationships and relied on cross-multiplication and
   across-multiplication strategies when solving the given problems.},

Abstract = {Stereotype threat theory (STT) presents a potential explanation for
   differences in achievement in math and science for women. Specifically,
   STT postulates that the perceived risk of confirming a negative
   stereotype about an individual's identity group acts as a psychological
   burden that negatively impacts performance. This study is the third in a
   series of studies examining the impact of ST on gender differences in
   science. The present study tested the impact of stereotype threat (ST)
   on gender differences in biology achievement, self-efficacy, motivation,
   and domain identification using a four-group, quasi-experimental design.
   83 introductory-level college biology students were randomly assigned to
   1 of 4 ST conditions including an explicit ST condition, an implicit ST
   condition, a reverse ST condition, and a nullified ST condition. Results
   indicated that there were no gender differences by ST condition;
   however, overall, the women identified more with the field.},

Abstract = {The language involved in de-contextualized integer comparisons poses
   challenges, as students may interpret most based on absolute values
   rather than on order. Using the context of temperature, we explored how
   students' integer value comparisons differed based on question phrasing
   (which temperature is hottest, most hot, least hot, coldest, most cold,
   least cold) and on numbers presented (positive, negative, mixed).
   Participants included 88 second graders and 70 fourth graders from a
   rural school district in the Midwestern USA, and each student solved 36
   integer comparisons. For comparisons with positive number choices,
   students had more difficulty with coldest than hottest; however, the
   results were reversed for comparisons with only negative number choices.
   When working with mixed comparisons, students often chose the least of
   the cold as opposed to the least cold, suggesting that they saw hot and
   cold as categorical opposites rather than opposites on a continuum, with
   zero as a boundary.},

Abstract = {Research apprenticeship experiences provide a uniquely authentic context
   for deepening participants' understanding of the nature of science and
   encouraging them to choose STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
   Mathematics) studies and careers. This study evaluated a STEM program
   for high school students who engaged in science research with the
   mentoring support of academic and industrial experts. The goals were to
   explore how graduates perceived the program as a factor affecting their
   choice to specialize in a STEM career and whether the findings
   demonstrate gender differences. Using the sequential mixed method, 24
   students were interviewed, and then, the findings were used to develop a
   questionnaire to which 116 program graduates responded. The responses
   revealed four main themes of contribution: development in science
   learning, development of self-efficacy, effect on students' choice of
   specializing in science and technology in the future, and sense of
   belonging to the residential area. The results indicate a positive
   correlation between the attitudes of students participating in the
   program and their expectation to pursue a STEM-related career.
   Statistically significant differences were found between the attitudes
   of the young men and women. The study provides a deeper understanding of
   the gender gaps in science education.},

Abstract = {The implementation of mathematical competencies in school curricula
   requires assessment instruments to be aligned with this new view on
   mathematical mastery. However, there are concerns over whether existing
   assessments capture the wide variety of cognitive skills and abilities
   that constitute mathematical competence. The current study applied an
   explanatory item response modelling approach to investigate how
   teacher-rated mathematical competency demands could account for the
   variation in item difficulty for mathematics items from the Programme
   for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 survey and a Norwegian
   national grade 10 exam. The results show that the rated competency
   demands can explain slightly more than and less than half of the
   variance in item difficulty for the PISA and exam items, respectively.
   This provides some empirical evidence for the relevance of the
   mathematical competencies for solving the assessment items. The results
   also show that for the Norwegian exam, only two of the competencies,
   Reasoning and argument and Symbols and formalism, appear to influence
   the difficulty of the items, which questions to what extent the exam
   items capture the variety of cognitive skills and abilities that
   constitute mathematical competence. We argue that this type of empirical
   data from the psychometric modelling should be used to improve
   assessments and assessment items, as well as to inform and possibly
   further develop theoretical concepts of mathematical competence.},

Title = {Synergy and Students' Explanations: Exploring the Role of Generic and

Abstract = {In this study, we explored how a teacher used a new mobile application
   that enables students to collect data inside and outside the classroom,
   and then use the data to create scientific explanations by using
   claim-evidence-reasoning framework. Previous technologies designed to
   support scientific explanations focused on how these programs improve
   students' scientific explanations, but these programs ignored how
   scientific explanation applications can support teacher practices. Thus,
   to increase our knowledge about using mobile devices in education, this
   study aims to portray the synergy with an emphasis on a teacher's
   practices when using mobile devices in 2 different units (water quality
   and plants). Synergy can be thought of as various scaffolds (scaffolds
   in the mobile application and the teacher support) working together to
   enable students to support creating explanations when using the mobile
   application. The findings of this study showed that the decrease in the
   teacher's support for claims did not affect the quality of the students'
   claims. On the other hand, the quality of students' reasoning was linked
   with the teacher's practices. This suggests that when supporting
   students' explanations, focusing on components that students find
   challenging would benefit students' construction of explanations. To
   achieve synergy in this process, the collaboration between teacher's
   practices, professional development days, and scaffolds designed to
   support the teacher played a crucial role in aiding students in creating
   explanations.},

Abstract = {This study adopted a cross-sectional and correlational research design
   in an attempt to add our understanding of student- and teacher-level
   factors that help explain variability in students' science achievement
   to the existing literature. More specifically, the present article
   examined students' science achievement in relation to their
   constructivist learning environment perceptions, epistemological
   beliefs, and self-regulation as well as their science teachers'
   characteristics. Data were gathered from both 137 science teachers and
   their 3281 seventh grade students via administering self-report
   questionnaires. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis was
   conducted to analyze the two-level data (student level and teacher
   level). Students' learning environment perceptions, epistemological
   beliefs, achievement goals, and self-regulation constituted
   student-level data while teachers' self-efficacy, achievement goals, and
   epistemological beliefs constituted teacher-level data. The findings
   indicated that students' constructivist learning environment perceptions
   were significant predictors of their science achievement. Additionally,
   students with sophisticated epistemological beliefs appeared to be more
   successful in science. Also, performance avoidance goals were negatively
   related to science achievement. Among teacher-level variables, teachers'
   self-efficacy and sophisticated epistemological beliefs were found to be
   positively linked to students' science achievement.},

Abstract = {This paper attempts to engage the field in a discussion about what
   mathematics is needed for students to engage in society, especially with
   an increase in technology and digitalization. In this respect,
   mathematics holds a special place in STEM as machines do most of the
   calculations that students are taught in K-12. We raise questions about
   what mathematical proficiency means in today's world and what shifts
   need to be made in both content and pedagogy to prepare students for
   21st Century Skills and mathematical reasoning.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-based measure of
   elementary students' science talk and to report students' benchmarks.
   The development procedure had three steps: defining the framework of the
   test, collecting and identifying key reference sets of science talk, and
   developing and verifying the science talk instrument. The Science Talk
   Test (STT), consisting of semi-structured items, was developed for a
   framework of exemplars from inquiry classrooms representing three
   inquiry components (i.e. identifying questions, designing methods and
   presenting evidence, and drawing evidence-based conclusions) for two
   types of science talk (i.e. factually oriented and evaluative
   discourses). Grades 4 and 6 students (N = 281) were selected from three
   levels of urbanization representative of Taiwan to verify the STT and to
   establish performance benchmarks. The STT's reliability, validity, and
   item parameters were found to be reasonable. Students performed better
   in the factually oriented talk than in the evaluative talk. Designing
   methods and presenting evidence was more difficult than the other two
   types of inquiry talk. Students' science talk ability was predictable
   with prior scientific knowledge and language ability measures. Practical
   use of the STT, explicit instruction, and future research are
   recommended.},

Title = {Using Variables in School Mathematics: Do School Mathematics Curricula
   Provide Support for Teachers?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This study employed content analysis to examine 3 popular middle-grades
   mathematics curricula in the USA on the support they provide for
   teachers to implement concepts associated with variables in school
   mathematics. The results indicate that each of the 3 curricula provides
   some type of support for teachers, but in a varied amount and quality.
   More specifically, whereas the University of Chicago School Mathematics
   Project (UCSMP) curriculum provides support for teachers on several
   aspects of using variables in school mathematics, the support found in
   the Connected Mathematics 2 and the Math Connects curricula focused
   mainly on one conception of variables-namely, the use of variables as
   quantity that varies in the Connected Mathematics 2 curriculum and the
   use of variables as specific unknowns in the Math Connects curriculum.
   Overall, the UCSMP curriculum provides the most support for teachers,
   followed by the Connected Mathematics 2 curriculum, with the Math
   Connects curriculum recording the least support for teachers to enact
   variable concepts. It is worth pointing out that, although the 3
   curricula collectively provide guidance for teachers to implement
   variable ideas within meaningful real-world contexts, the supports
   identified in the respective curriculum were not sufficient in
   addressing all of the areas that are essential for teaching the many
   concepts associated with variables in school mathematics effectively.
   Recommendations for curriculum developers and for international
   researchers with interest in the roles of variables in school
   mathematics are provided.},

Abstract = {In Sweden, there is concern about fewer students taking chemistry
   courses in higher education, especially at university level. Using a
   survey, this study investigates the reasons upper secondary school
   chemistry students choose to follow the Swedish Natural Science
   Programme. In addition, students' views about their chemistry education
   are sought and their ideas about how to improve their chemistry
   experience. A questionnaire with closed and open questions was completed
   by 495 chemistry students from different schools in Sweden. The analysis
   shows that most students have high interest-enjoyment value of
   chemistry, but both positive and negative responses about their
   chemistry education refer to the importance of the teacher and the
   structure of lessons. To improve their chemistry experience, students
   suggest making it relevant to everyday life and being more practical and
   more student centred. For positively inclined students to maintain their
   value of chemistry beyond schooling into choice at university level, the
   programme should take these suggestions into account.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the successes and difficulties that
   teachers perceived as they enacted an argument-based inquiry approach;
   and instructional strategies that teachers used within an argument-based
   inquiry approach. Nineteen elementary teachers from 14 Midwestern
   elementary schools were enrolled in an intensive 2-week professional
   development program along with 2 follow-up workshops focusing on an
   argument-based inquiry approach, i.e., the Science Writing Heuristic
   (SWH) approach. The teachers implemented at least 1 lesson using the SWH
   approach during the first semester after the 2-week professional
   development program and a series of lessons for a unit during the second
   semester. Data collection consisted of teachers' written reflection
   supplemented by their lesson plans. Data analyses indicated that most
   teachers viewed students' authentic learning and engagement as the
   benefits of the argument-based inquiry approach. A majority of the
   teachers also mentioned students' lack of decision making ability and
   difficulty of writing their thoughts. Class discussions, scaffolding,
   and modeling argumentation were used by the participant teachers as
   instructional strategies as ways to embrace the argument-based inquiry
   approach in their science classrooms.},

Abstract = {We examined several facets of general pedagogical knowledge and skills
   of early career mathematics teachers, asking how they are associated
   with characteristics of teacher education, teaching experience, and
   working conditions. Declarative general pedagogical knowledge (GPK) was
   assessed via a paper-and-pencil test, while early career teachers'
   skills to perceive and interpret classroom situations were assessed via
   video-vignettes. Data from a follow-up study of TEDS-M Germany in 2012
   were used, including a sample of 278 early career middle school teachers
   of mathematics. While teachers' declarative knowledge can be predicted
   by teacher education grades, teachers' skill to interpret classroom
   situations presented by videos can be predicted by their amount of time
   spent on teaching relative to their overall working time, which is
   interpreted as a form of deliberate practice. Different competence
   profiles of pedagogical knowledge and skills are identified via
   latent-class analysis. Besides teaching experience, profiles are
   associated with generic teaching challenges (motivating students,
   disruptive student behaviour) perceived by the teachers. Implications of
   findings for professional development of early career teachers are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The science vocabulary from a science curriculum standards document
   (Ministry of Education Ontario, 2007) was classified by morphological
   developmental level and compared to the grade level topics of the
   curriculum (grades 1 to 8). Descriptive statistical analyses highlight
   the complex nature of science vocabulary and the incompatibilities
   between the conceptual nature of science vocabulary and the
   developmental reading levels of elementary students. These findings
   provide implications for teachers to encourage learning in science
   through scaffolded vocabulary instruction with multimodal, integrated
   resources. As learning through multiliteracies evolves in the
   twenty-first century, science-specific vocabulary acquisition should
   garner renewed interest to ensure that discipline-based texts are
   reflective of content standards and are accessible to all readers.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses beliefs about teaching and learning chemistry. The
   sample includes chemistry student teachers and in-service teachers from
   Jordan, Turkey, and Germany. Two test instruments were used to
   investigate (student) teachers' beliefs. A qualitative instrument was
   used to explore Beliefs about Classroom Organization, Beliefs about
   Teaching Objectives, and Epistemological Beliefs. A quantitative
   instrument was added to evaluate participants' beliefs concerning the
   Nature of Good Education. The results show that Jordanian chemistry
   teachers and teacher trainees held the most traditional,
   teacher-centered, and transmission-oriented beliefs, while the German
   sample showed the most modern beliefs toward teaching and learning.
   Turkish (student) teachers evidenced more moderate beliefs, which tended
   to be between the two extremes, but that could still be positioned more
   closely to the traditional way of thinking. The results are discussed in
   the context of chemistry teacher education in the three respective
   countries.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the validity of modeling
   science achievement in terms of 3 social psychological variables (school
   connectedness, science attitude, and active learning) and 2
   self-perception variables (self-confidence and science value). Two
   models were tested: full mediation and partial mediation. In the
   full-mediation model, effects of the 3 social psychological variables
   upon science achievement were hypothesized to be completely mediated
   through science value and self-confidence. In the partial-mediation
   model, however, those 3 variables were hypothesized to affect
   achievement directly as well as indirectly through the mediating roles
   of science value and self-confidence. Data were obtained from Grade 8
   Saudi students (N = 4,099) who participated in TIMSS 2007. The
   relationships among constructs were examined with the use of structural
   equation modeling software Mplus7. Results indicated that both models
   performed adequately in terms of fit indices, but the partial-mediation
   model was retained due to its superiority over the full-mediation model
   in representing the sample covariance matrix as tested through
   chi-square difference test. The mediating role of self-confidence in the
   relationships of science attitude and active learning to achievement was
   substantiated, but the mediating role of science value was not
   supported.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a cross-level study of German student teachers'
   beliefs about teaching and learning chemistry. It covers different
   stages of their teacher training program. The study is based upon
   drawings of teaching situations, which were analyzed using an evaluation
   pattern developed using grounded theory. The qualitative scales analyze
   beliefs about classroom organization, teaching objectives, and
   epistemological beliefs. Data were collected from university freshmen,
   student teachers midway through their university teacher education
   program, and recently graduated teachers who had just finished their
   university program and are gaining experience as full-time teachers. The
   initial results reveal that the freshmen in our study profess very
   traditional beliefs about teaching and learning (characterized by
   teacher-centeredness and an understanding of learning as receptive
   consumption). The other two groups of trainees hold more modern beliefs
   about teaching and learning, which are in line with modern educational
   theory. Comparing the latter two groups shows that the student teachers
   midway through training appear to have the most modern teaching beliefs.
   Implications for teacher education will be addressed.},

Title = {THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEARNERS' DISTRUST OF SCIENTIFIC MODELS, THEIR
   SPATIAL ABILITY, AND THE VIVIDNESS OF THEIR MENTAL IMAGES},

Abstract = {The purpose of the current study was to examine the nature of the
   relationship between learners' distrust of scientific models that
   represent unseen entities and phenomena, their spatial ability, and the
   vividness of their mental images. The sample consisted of 302 tenth
   grade students in the Sultanate of Oman. Three measures were used for
   this study: the Epistemologies about the Credibility of Scientific
   Models instrument, the Water Level Task (WLT), and the Vividness of
   Microscopic Mental Images. It was found that students' distrust was
   greater for theoretical and abstract models such as the electron clouds,
   photons, magnetic lines of force, DNA, electron transfer, atomic orbits,
   and alpha rays. The findings also show that there was a statistically
   significant negative correlation between students' distrust of
   scientific models and their spatial ability, as indicated by their
   performance on the WLT. There was a positive relationship between the
   distrust of scientific models and the vividness of mental images and a
   weak negative relationship between spatial ability and the vividness of
   mental images. Based on the findings, it might be plausible to conclude
   that as the abstraction level for scientific models increases, such as
   for theoretical models which lack defined structure and known details,
   imaginative learners' difficulty to construct colorful and detailed
   mental images for natural entities and phenomena increases. It would
   also be recommended that learners with vivid mental images should be
   provided with and directed to use more spatial techniques such as
   computerized visualization tools and mental manipulation of 3D objects.},

Abstract = {This study examined student indicators for success in entry-level
   college calculus. An attitude toward mathematics inventory, course
   performance, readiness assessment, and student interviews were used to
   determine characteristics and behaviors of students who succeeded in the
   course. In addition to student indicators, difficult topics and
   suggestions for improvement in the course structure were identified.
   While the focus of this study was on student indicators, the analyses of
   instructor interviews were included in order to compare their views with
   those of the students. The quantitative analyses showed that high school
   grade point average and the Calculus Readiness Assessment had positive
   significant correlations with course performance. The strongest positive
   significant correlation, however, was between attitude (Attitudes Toward
   Mathematics Inventory overall and confidence subscale) and course
   performance.},

Abstract = {This study explored Saudi elementary school science teachers' beliefs
   about the process of teaching and learning science. This involved the
   exploration of their views about the new Saudi science curriculum, which
   emphasizes critical thinking and problem solving. Comprehensive
   interviews were held in 8 schools with 4 male and 6 female-2 of whom
   were from private schools-science teachers. The interviews were analyzed
   to identify and assess common themes among their beliefs as well as
   associations between their beliefs and self-reported classroom
   practices. The findings revealed perceptual differences between teaching
   the old and the new science curricula and also that these science
   teachers were challenged by available class time, the student-teacher
   ratio, and the lack of laboratory space, equipment, and administrative
   support. It appears that the more interactive and group-oriented
   activities that formed the instructional foundation of the new
   curriculum have increased enjoyment for teaching science and led
   students to better comprehension of scientific concepts.},

Abstract = {Learning to think spatially in mathematics involves developing
   proficiency with graphics. This paper reports on 2 investigations of
   spatial thinking and graphics. The first investigation explored the
   importance of graphics as 1 of 3 communication systems (i.e. text,
   symbols, graphics) used to provide information in numeracy test items.
   The results showed that graphics were embedded in at least 50 \% of test
   items across 3 year levels. The second investigation examined 11 -
   12-year-olds' performance on 2 mathematical tasks which required
   substantial interpretation of graphics and spatial thinking. The
   outcomes revealed that many students lacked proficiency in the basic
   spatial skills of visual memory and spatial perception and the more
   advanced skills of spatial orientation and spatial visualisation. This
   paper concludes with a reaffirmation of the importance of spatial
   thinking in mathematics and proposes ways to capitalize on graphics in
   learning to think spatially.},

Title = {MEASURING SCIENCE INTEREST: RASCH VALIDATION OF THE SCIENCE INTEREST
   SURVEY},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Students in the USA have fallen near the bottom in international
   competitions and tests in mathematics and science. It is thought that
   extrinsic factors such as family, community, and schools might be more
   influential than intrinsic attitudes toward science interest. However,
   there are relatively few valid and reliable measures of intrinsic
   factors such as interest relating to science. With the lack of intrinsic
   measures, it is difficult to determine the impact of extrinsic factors
   on the intrinsic construct. A fuller picture of the factors affecting
   intrinsic factors such as science interest will allow interventions to
   become more refined and targeted. Several studies suggest that student
   interest toward science affects the likelihood of the student pursuing
   advanced courses in science. The goal of this paper is to establish the
   validity and reliability of the Science Interest Survey and to determine
   if the survey meets the formal requirements of measurements as defined
   by the Rasch model. Results using both IRT and CRT analysis suggest that
   Science Interest Survey is an adequate measure of the unidimensional
   construct known as science interest. Results further suggest the Science
   Interest Survey is a valid and reliable measure for assessing science
   interest levels.},

Abstract = {One common theme underlying recent reports on science education is that
   the content of school science and its related pedagogical approaches are
   not aligned with the interests and needs of both society and the
   majority of the students. Most students do not find their science
   classes interesting and motivating. These claims are especially valid
   regarding those students who, in the future, will probably not embark on
   a career in science or engineering but will need science and technology
   personally and functionally as literate citizens. One key problem seems
   to be that few science programs around the world teach how science is
   linked to those issues that are relevant to students' life, environment,
   and role as a citizen. As a result, many students are unable to
   participate in societal discussions about science and its related
   technological applications. This paper discusses the need to incorporate
   socioscientific ideas into the science curricula more thoroughly. This
   recommendation is supported by a theoretical rationale from various
   sources leading to a reflection about common practices in science
   education in three countries: Israel, Germany, and the USA. The
   state-of-the-art, potentials, and barriers of effective implementation
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a questionnaire that could
   measure preservice mathematics teachers' mathematics educational values.
   Development and validation of the questionnaire involved a sequential
   inquiry in which design principles were established from the existing
   literature and a pool of items was constructed then submitted to experts
   for consideration of the construct validity. Alterations to the items
   based on their suggestions were made to produce a trial version of the
   questionnaire. A pilot study involving preservice mathematics teachers
   explored the validity and usefulness of the questionnaire. The pilot
   results were used to revise the questionnaire that was administered to a
   sample of preservice mathematics teachers attending Cumhuriyet
   University, Sivas, Turkey. Further explorations of the construct and
   structural validity, item contributions, and reliability were achieved
   by using a factor analysis and two different item analysis methods.
   Results revealed that the questionnaire included four factors,
   satisfactory item contributions, and acceptable internal consistency.
   One result obtained in this study suggested that some mathematics
   education values based on Western culture (e. g., accessibility-special)
   have not been accepted by Turkish preservice mathematics teachers.},

Abstract = {The study investigates the relationship between general and
   context-specific conceptions of the nature of science (NOS). The
   categorization scheme by Osborne et al. (J Res Sci Teach 40:692-720,
   2003) served as the theoretical framework of the study. In the category
   nature of scientific knowledge, the certainty, development, simplicity,
   justification, and source of scientific knowledge were distinguished. In
   the category methods of science, the purpose of science and the
   creativity of scientists were mentioned. The study was conducted with
   221 secondary school students, who filled in a 40-item questionnaire on
   general NOS conceptions. Furthermore, students were provided with
   different contexts by a short description of 10 scientific theories.
   After the theory introduction, students indicated context-specific
   conceptions as well as the importance and familiarity of each theory.
   Study results show that higher familiarity with scientific theories is
   related to a more informed view about the general nature of science.
   Correlational analyses illustrate that context-specific and general
   conceptions about NOS are not independent from each other but have a
   mutual core. Context-specific conceptions are not so different from
   their general counterparts that these aspects cannot be combined in a
   NOS questionnaire.},

Title = {A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF PISA'S ASSESSMENT ON SCIENTIFIC LITERACY},

Abstract = {The OECD ``Programme for International Student Assessment{''} or (PISA)
   is one of the largest-scale international efforts that have been
   launched to assess students' scientific literacy. Such an international
   assessment would likely exert a profound impact on the science education
   policies of the participating countries/regions, including Hong Kong.
   This paper sets out to examine critically how scientific literacy has
   been assessed by PISA through analyzing its assessment frameworks and
   released sample items. It was found that the PISA 2000 and 2003
   assessments of science have used a narrower definition of scientific
   literacy, as compared to that of PISA 2006 and what scientific literacy
   was construed for science education. However, even PISA 2006 appears to
   be more valid in its assessment framework, its validity was also called
   into question when the sample items for the trial study were examined.
   Knowledge about science was found largely about the processes of
   science, rather than the nature of science as described in the
   assessment framework. Besides, it intertwined with knowledge of science
   in a hidden manner. The application of knowledge of science in novel,
   real-life situations was also jeopardized because of the issue of
   curricular relevance. Besides these major problems, the article has
   discussed the problems with the concept of scientifically investigable
   questions and identifying research question of an investigation.
   Overall, the findings raised concern over what the PISA's measure of
   scientific literacy actually means.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we describe empirical research on the recording of
   primary school and preschool student teacher conceptions of the concept
   of distant force interactions in different contexts related to the
   school curriculum for this subject. For this objective to be achieved,
   we undertook ten semi-structured interviews with student teachers. Based
   on the findings from these interviews, we developed a written ten-item
   questionnaire that was distributed to 264 first-year student teachers at
   three Greek universities. The main findings of our research are that a
   significant number of students: (i) experience difficulty in recognizing
   the interactions in different contexts, and even in different cases
   within the same context; (ii) place the arrow representing the force on
   the body that exerts it and not on that which accepts it; and (iii) hold
   the alternative view that the larger the body interacting, the greater
   the force it exerts. Based on the above results, as well as in the ways
   in which they seem to be related, we developed hypotheses, potentially
   able to lead to the construction of a teaching-learning sequence, which
   focuses on the comprehension of force as the measure of a unified
   concept of interaction between two entities.},

Abstract = {This study uses classroom videotapes to examine the phenomenon of
   students who are left behind during whole-class teaching. Zooming in via
   these videos enabled us to analyze these classroom situations by means
   of a compact, multi-perspective set of theories - van Hiele theory,
   conceptualization, and visual perception. The analysis provided a
   picture of the classroom interaction in which the sound of silence of
   those students who might not share understanding during the class
   discourse is ignored. Based on a sample of Taiwanese junior high school
   geometry classes, the study demonstrated how investigating situations of
   silence uncovered the possibility of teachers' unawareness of student
   difficulties or their unsuccessful efforts to cope with them. Teachers'
   post-lesson interviews and questionnaires shed additional light on the
   perspective of left-behind students. Implications of this method for
   pre- and in-service teachers' programs are briefly discussed, and some
   recommendations for change are proposed.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {School science systems tend to emphasize teaching and learning about
   achievements of science (such as laws and theories) at the expense of
   providing students with opportunities to develop realistic conceptions
   about science and science inquiry and expertise they could use to
   conduct their own science inquiry projects. Among reasons for such an
   emphasis, teachers' lack of experiences with realistic science inquiry
   appears to be particularly problematic. Accordingly, we engaged
   student-teachers in a university-based course that attempted to balance
   instruction about science and science inquiry with student-teachers' own
   theorization about science and science inquiry. Qualitative data
   collected mainly from nine student-teachers in four focus groups
   indicate that these student-teachers' motivation for promoting
   student-led science inquiry projects in schools significantly increased
   by the end of the course. Analyses suggest that this outcome was
   influenced by changes in their conceptions about the nature of science,
   changes in how they associated science inquiry with student learning,
   and the inductive-deductive dialectic immersion that was built into
   their pre-service methods course. Implications of these findings for
   science teacher education are explored in this paper.},

Title = {Learning Aids' Effect on Mathematics Performance of Grade 8 Students in
   Vocational Education in Flanders (Belgium)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 22},
Abstract = {Based on the sociocultural theory of learning and distributed cognition,
   using learning aids should benefit students' performance, as learning
   aids can compensate for a lack of knowledge or skills and reduce strain
   on short-term memory. The present study investigated the use of a
   diverse set of learning aids in Grade 8 of vocational education in
   Flanders (the northern part of Belgium) and whether access to learning
   aids affects students' mathematics performance. Data from the 2019
   national assessment on mathematics were used. The teacher questionnaire
   showed that learning aids were available in most classes for all
   students. Overall, the calculator is the most frequently used learning
   aid, together with the multiplication table and conversion table. A
   field experiment was conducted, with a condition where students were
   allowed to use learning aids and a condition where students were not
   allowed to use learning aids. A multilevel model was used to test for
   differences. The results revealed that access to learning aids does not
   significantly increase students' performance, and, thus, access to
   learning aids does not generate an unfair advantage.},

Title = {Examine the Impact of Contextual, Personal, and Behavioral Factors on
   High School Teachers' Engagement in Teaching Science Using an Integrated
   STEM Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 13},
Abstract = {Teachers' self-efficacy, attitude, and engagement are influenced by
   various factors, encompassing personal, school contextual, and
   behavioral aspects. Nevertheless, prior studies have not thoroughly
   explored the intricate relationship between teachers' self-efficacy,
   attitudes, and engagement, particularly in the context of teaching
   science through an integrated STEM approach (ISTEMA). Drawing upon the
   Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior, this study
   proposes a structural equation model that incorporates school contextual
   factors: school administrative support and peer or collegial support,
   along with the personal factor-teachers' STEM discipline knowledge to
   predict teachers' self-efficacy in teaching science through ISTEMA. It
   also considers school administrative support and teachers' self-efficacy
   to teach science through an ISTEMA as predictors for teachers' attitudes
   and engagement in the implementation of ISTEMA. Additionally, school
   administrative support, teachers' self-efficacy to teach science through
   ISTEMA, and teachers' attitude to teach science through ISTEMA are
   regarded as behavioral factors that predict engagement in the
   implementation of ISTEMA. The survey was administered to 452 high school
   teachers hailing from four distinct regions and Phnom Penh City,
   Cambodia. The results of the full structural equation modeling (SEM)
   analysis revealed that changes in teachers' STEM discipline knowledge
   and peer or collegial support may correspondingly lead to changes in
   teachers' self-efficacy to teach science through an ISTEMA (SE), with an
   indirect effect of school administrative support (AD) on SE via
   teachers' STEM discipline knowledge. The enhancement of SE and teachers'
   attitude to teach science through an ISTEMA (ATT) significantly
   influences teachers' engagement to teach science through an ISTEMA
   (EGG), whereas AD has a direct impact on engagement and an indirect one
   via teachers' self-efficacy and attitude. Furthermore, SE directly and
   indirectly affects engagement through teachers' attitude. These findings
   hold profound significance in shaping policies related to teacher
   training in integrated STEM education and theoretical foundation for
   future studies.},

Abstract = {The social cure is the concept that strong connections and social bonds
   are good for wellbeing and physical health. Having strong social support
   makes hardship easier to cope with. We hypothesize that we could apply
   the relationship to educational contexts, with a sense of belonging as
   part of the cohort or community helping students to cope with
   educational hurdles, resulting in greater wellbeing. We examined the
   case of women in physics. Previous research has suggested that women in
   physics classes report a lesser sense of belonging than men. We aimed to
   replicate this finding and examine how a sense of belonging relates to
   wellbeing. We surveyed 310 physics students (205 men, 105 women) from a
   small research-intensive university in the UK. The survey measured
   students' physics identity, sense of belonging to the physics community,
   self-efficacy (belief in ability to complete physics-based tasks), and
   general wellbeing. We found that women and men reported similar levels
   of belonging and wellbeing, although women reported less physics
   identity and self-efficacy. Self-efficacy explained a significant
   fraction of the variance in wellbeing for both men and women.
   Additionally, belonging explained variance in wellbeing over and above
   self-efficacy and physics identity for men, but not for women. These
   results indicate that for men there is a stronger association between
   belonging and wellbeing, compared to women, but that it does not result
   in women having an overall lower sense of wellbeing.},

Abstract = {There are relatively few studies examining cooperative learning during
   laboratory activities in a science museum. This study aims to explore
   such activities to better understand the nature of cooperative learning,
   if any, in that setting. The participants in this study were 60
   fourth-grade students who visited a science museum lab as part of a
   school field trip. The students, divided into 12 groups, were videotaped
   and audio-recorded during group work consisting of balancing a scale.
   Our inductive data analysis of the observations revealed that although
   each group's interactions were distinctive, common themes emerged.
   Moreover, even though the group work required cooperative learning,
   students did not engage in such. Students mostly instructed each other
   on how to operate the scale, with no scientific explanations. As the
   students did not know how to work together in order to solve the task,
   frustration abounded. This research adds to the body of knowledge about
   lab activities in science museum and offer practical implication to
   design more effective activities in these settings. Careful pedagogy and
   thoughtful facilitation can contribute to the students' learning
   outcomes; therefore, educators should consider the following: ensuring
   students have sufficient prior knowledge, having the museum educator
   play the role of a mediator, taking steps to reduce the level of student
   frustration, and planning additional activities that promote the
   learning outcomes of the activity.},

Abstract = {The intersection of modeling and STEM practices offers a promising
   avenue for creating an integrated STEM curriculum. However, research on
   designing modeling-based STEM (m-STEM) curricula is limited,
   particularly concerning how the curriculum affects the learning of
   students with different spatial abilities. This study developed a
   four-round modeling cycle using highway route selection as the topic to
   support the development of modeling practices for learners with diverse
   spatial abilities. Using a mixed-method research approach, this study
   collected and analyzed the modeling practices of 24 Taiwanese upper
   elementary school students with different spatial abilities by modeling
   practice worksheets. Further analysis of the modeling practices was
   conducted on students in the top third and bottom third of spatial
   abilities. Qualitative data, including interviews, classroom
   observations, and teacher reflections, were also analyzed to identify
   the curriculum factors influencing learning in students with different
   spatial abilities. Results revealed that all students increased their
   modeling practices from level 1 (single factor) to level 3 (relation) as
   the model complexity increased, indicating the effectiveness of the
   m-STEM curriculum. Additionally, the curriculum improved the equity of
   spatial ability in modeling practices. Low-spatial ability students
   benefited from hands-on practices and digital tools during the modeling
   selection phase. In contrast, high-spatial ability students benefited
   from analogies and experimental thinking during the model construction
   phase. This study highlights the potential for m-STEM curricula to
   promote learning equity and provides insights into effective and
   inclusive design practices for STEM educators.},

Abstract = {The Van Hiele model of geometric reasoning establishes five levels of
   development, from level 1 (visual) to level 5 (rigor). Despite the fact
   that this model has been deeply studied, there are few research works
   concerning the fifth level. However, there are some works that point out
   the interest of working with activities at this level to promote the
   acquisition of previous levels. Our goal is to describe this level
   through the construction and validation of a list of indicators for each
   of the processes involved in geometrical reasoning (definition, proof,
   classification, and identification). Due to the lack of previous
   research, we have decided to use the Delphi methodology. This approach
   allowed us to collect information from a panel of experts to reach a
   consensus through a series of phases about the indicators that describe
   each of the processes. The final product of the iterative application of
   this method is a list of validated indicators of the fifth Van Hiele
   level of reasoning. In particular, proof and definition processes have
   turned out to be the most relevant processes at this level.},

Title = {Middle School Graduates' Understandings of Scientific Inquiry and Its
   Relation to Academic Achievement},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Month = {2023 MAR 21},
Abstract = {There are conflicting reports not only on the effect of scientific
   inquiry on academic achievement but also insufficient evidence on the
   relationship between understanding the nature of scientific inquiry and
   academic achievement; more generalizable studies are needed. The purpose
   of this large sampled study was to investigate the middle school
   graduates' understandings of scientific inquiry (SI) and the
   relationship between students' understandings of SI and academic
   achievement. The sample of the study (X = 3067) was selected by
   purposeful and layered-sampling techniques among ninth grade students
   studying at high schools with different orientations in Istanbul.
   Descriptive and inferential statistical approaches were used in the data
   analysis procedure. The students' academic achievement was operationally
   defined as the scores they received in the High School Entrance Exam
   (HEE). Views about scientific inquiry scale was applied to determine the
   participants' understandings about scientific inquiry. The data were
   collected in the first 2 weeks of the first semester of high school in
   accordance with the purpose of the study. The results of the study
   revealed that middle school graduates generally do not have adequate
   understandings of SI. Furthermore, according to the findings except for
   the ``conclusion data conformity{''} aspect, there are statistically
   significant correlations between students' academic achievement and
   understandings in all aspects of SI.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to broaden the scope of the construct concept image by
   addressing the mathematically oriented notion of ``solution of an
   algebraic equation. `` The notion solution of an algebraic equation is
   not mathematical per se, but it is most prevalent in mathematical
   communications and in mathematics education. The paper describes five
   episodes of lesson segments that were collected in a secondary school
   mathematics teaching certificate program. The specific tasks, the
   episodes, and the related class discussions, involving the notion of
   solution of algebraic equation, are described. Several issues, arising
   from the various concept images of solution of equations, including
   miscommunication, ambiguity about correctness, ranking correctness, and
   minimizing errors, are discussed. Along an analysis of these data, 4
   suggestions are offered for improving the communication around the
   notion solution of an algebraic equation: promote awareness, offer
   instructional guidelines, suggest a vocabulary, and be sensitive.},

Abstract = {Inquiry-based practices have important impacts on student science
   learning outcomes, yet the psychological mechanisms behind the
   relationships are less clear. This study aimed to explore the mediating
   effects of science attitudes in the relationship between
   student-perceived inquiry-based practices and scientific literacy using
   data from eight countries in the 2015 Programme for International
   Student Assessment (PISA). Results of multilevel structural equation
   modeling (MSEM) suggested that (1) the three science attitudinal
   factors, i.e., interest in science, science self-efficacy, and
   instrumental motivation of learning science, served as significant
   mediators between perceived inquiry-based practices and scientific
   literacy; (2) the direct effect of perceived inquiry-based practices on
   scientific literacy was consistently negative across the countries, yet
   consistently positive on the three attitudinal factors; and (3) the
   indirect effects of perceived inquiry-based practices on scientific
   literacy via interest in science and science self-efficacy were
   consistently positive across the countries while negative via
   instrumental motivation for six out of the eight countries. The results
   may provide deeper insights into inquiry-based practices and suggest
   ways for science educators to improve student science attitudes and
   science learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between
   high school students' understandings of aspects about nature of science
   (NOS) and their argumentation skills, particularly whether informed
   conceptions of NOS contribute to better argumentation skills.
   Participants, a total of 125 Grade 10 students, responded to an
   open-ended questionnaire, Controversial Socioscientific Issues
   Questionnaire (CSI), that involved two scenarios addressing
   socioscientific issues (SSI) about genetically modified food and water
   fluoridation. Each of the two scenarios was accompanied by two sets of
   questions that address argumentation and NOS. Stepwise regression
   analyses were performed on data from the participants' responses with
   three NOS aspects (subjective, tentative, and empirical) as independent
   variables and the argumentation components (argument, counterargument,
   and rebuttal) as dependent variables (each at a time). The results
   demonstrated positive correlation between argumentation and NOS.
   Moreover, the results showed that the tentative, empirical, and
   subjective aspects are significant predictors of the argumentation
   components with some variations depending on the context (whether
   genetically modified food or water fluoridation). These results provide
   concrete evidence illustrating the associations between argumentation
   and NOS knowledge within two SSI (water fluoridation and genetically
   modified food).},

Abstract = {This paper describes a randomized and controlled efficacy study
   conducted in high school biology classrooms across the USA. In this
   study, teachers implemented the use of Data Nuggets, activities designed
   to bring real research and data into the classroom. These materials can
   be embedded within the existing instructional modality of any given
   curriculum, thus infusing these curricula with science stories and
   associated datasets. Our design had teachers incorporate Data Nuggets
   into one of their class sections, while teaching a second class section
   in a business-asusual manner. Although students in both conditions
   improved similarly in quantitative reasoning over the course of the
   study semester, we saw several key differences for students taught using
   the intervention as compared to those taught using only standard
   instruction. Students in classrooms that utilized Data Nuggets spent
   more time engaged in the practices of science and had greater
   improvement in their ability to construct scientific explanations. In
   addition, students using the intervention activities showed increases in
   both their self-efficacy in data-related tasks and their interest in
   STEM careers. Finally, the effects of teacher implementation on student
   outcomes when using Data Nuggets were assessed.},

Title = {Attention Drifting Away While Test-Taking: Mind-Wandering in Students
   with Low- and High-Performance Levels in TIMSS-Like Science Tests},

Abstract = {When individuals' attention shifts away from the primary tasks they are
   involved in, their minds start to wander. This mental phenomenon, also
   known as mind-wandering, can interact with other variables and affect
   the performance of academic tasks. The current study focuses
   particularly on the mind-wandering (MW) of Omani students while they
   were taking TIMSS-like science tests and examines the results in
   relation to their performance levels in the test, their grade level
   (i.e. age), and the cognitive level of the test items. The participants
   were 776 Omani students, 342 in Grade 5 and 434 in Grade 9. The tests
   used were designed to resemble actual TIMSS science tests and are
   therefore referred to as TIMSS-like science tests. Student MW was
   measured by the embedding of self-report probes at four points in the
   tests; the use of self-report probes has been widely adopted in previous
   research studies. The current researchers designed a mobile application
   to host the tests; the app was installed on tablets which participants
   used to take the test. Results indicated that low-scoring learners in
   both grade levels had significantly higher MW than high-achieving
   learners, and that this was true when they were doing both lower-order
   and higher-order test questions. However, there was a difference in the
   patterns of MW between students in the two different grades. For Grade 5
   students, the difference in MW between low and high scorers followed a
   similar pattern at all stages of the test, while this was not the case
   with Grade 9 test-takers. There were significant differences in the
   repeated measures of MW of both low and high performers in Grade 9,
   while the repeated measures of MW interacted significantly with the
   levels (low and high) of performance on the lower-level questions in
   Grade 5 only. No other interaction was detected. The findings of this
   study have shed light on the importance of taking into consideration
   students' MW while they are taking tests, but further research is needed
   to explore potential methods to keep their attention focused on the
   test.},

Abstract = {The burden placed by human activities on Earth is ever-increasing.
   Global environmental changes have profoundly affected the Earth's core
   systems and processes, thus, risking their stability. These core systems
   and processes are described in the planetary boundary framework. The
   drastic rate of environmental change over the last 200 years, which is
   also known as the Great Acceleration, has been depicted graphically by
   the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program. This study is aimed to
   (1) examine the conceptions of students and scientists regarding
   socioeconomic growth within planetary boundaries, and (2) develop
   instructional guidelines based on the comparison of their conceptions.
   Accordingly, relevant conceptions of 22 junior and 20 senior secondary
   school students were analyzed. Scientists' conceptions were extracted by
   thoroughly analyzing nine publications, which were selected by
   systematic literature search. Student statements and scientific
   inferences were coded following established protocols. Our results
   indicated that junior and senior secondary school students considered
   global population growth to be the primary cause of global environmental
   changes. On the contrary, the scientists considered the quantity of
   natural resources consumed by rich countries in their economic pursuits
   as the most critical factor in environmental degradation. Based on our
   findings, we proposed instructional guidelines for planning lessons on
   changing current socioeconomic systems to enable humans to live within
   planetary boundaries.},

Title = {The Interrelationship Among High School Students' Conceptions of
   Learning Science, Self-Regulated Learning Science, and Science Learning

Abstract = {This research explored the interrelationship among Taiwanese high school
   students' conceptions of learning science (COLS), self-regulated
   learning science (SRLS), and science learning self-efficacy (SLSE). A
   total of 309 students participated in the study, and the self-report
   survey data were collected to measure these three constructs. Four COLS
   factors (Testing, Calculating and practicing, Application, and
   Understanding and seeing in a new way), two SRLS dimensions (Preparatory
   SRLS {[}task definition, goal setting, planning] and Enactment SRLS
   {[}controlling, monitoring, reflecting]), and two SLSE factors
   (Conceptual understanding and Higher-order cognitive skills), which
   adhere to the cognitive learning dimensions, were included for analysis.
   The results revealed a direct relationship between Testing and SLSE
   without going through any of the SRLS constructs. However, no direct
   relationship was built among other COLS components and the two SLSE
   dimensions. There are direct relationships among Calculating and
   practicing, Application, and the two SRLS constructs, but Understanding
   and seeing in a new way solely links to Enactment SRLS and not to
   Preparatory SRLS. In the end, the two SRLS constructs are directly
   associated with the students' SLSE dimensions. These results have the
   important implication that learners' COLS have a significant impact on
   their SRL engagement, which eventually leads to their beliefs about
   their cognitive abilities in learning the abstract concepts and critical
   thinking tasks in science.},

Abstract = {The aim of this pseudo-longitudinal study is to investigate pre-service
   teachers' beliefs about (1) the nature of mathematics and (2)
   mathematics teaching and learning and the development of both beliefs
   over the course of their studies. A quantitative belief questionnaire
   was completed by 142 participants divided into three groups based on
   their years of studies: Beginning, Middle, and End. Additionally, five
   pre-service teachers from the End group were interviewed to explore the
   influence of different university courses on the development of their
   beliefs. The data analyses show a significant difference between the
   Beginning and the End group regarding beliefs about mathematics favoring
   a problem-solving view. The difference is an indication related to the
   development of beliefs about mathematics during teacher education.
   Courses dealing with university mathematics seem to be responsible for
   the development. Further, the data analyses also show significant
   differences between the Beginning and End group regarding beliefs about
   teaching and learning, also favoring a problem-solving view in a class
   dominated by low-achieving students. The differences indicate that
   beliefs about teaching and learning develop during teacher education.
   However, no evidence supports the hypothesis that courses related to
   mathematics education contribute to the observed differences. Instead,
   experiences during an internship semester in observing as well as
   teaching in real classes by applying what has been promoted in the
   courses may contribute to the development. Possible explanations
   regarding the development of beliefs and the contribution of courses in
   teacher education as well as the implication of the findings are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Despite calls for more attention to the preparation of those who prepare
   teachers, there have been few examples of institutionally sanctioned and
   structured learning opportunities created to equip faculty with the
   knowledge and skills necessary to become effective teacher educators. In
   this paper, we describe a cross-disciplinary and collaborative
   initiative that involves shadowing of colleagues as a means of
   supporting the professional learning of science teacher educators. We
   illustrate the unique affordance of this model and highlight our
   professional learning across multiple dimensions: cognitive, practical,
   relational, and emotional. We illustrate how shadowing can support the
   learning of faculty at different career stages and from different
   disciplinary backgrounds and entry points to teacher education through a
   series of vignettes of shadowing in a variety of course contexts.
   Finally, we offer considerations for the transferability of our model to
   other institutions and contexts, and how further research conducted in
   the context of shadowing could help deepen our understanding of the
   knowledge base of science teacher educators and how this knowledge is
   developed.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses, empirically, on the developments seen in a group of
   South African early grades' mathematics teacher educators in the course
   of a university-provincial education department partnership project.
   This project sought to support the district Mathematics Subject Advisers
   to support, in turn, teachers to implement an intervention consisting of
   a sequence of four lessons focused on multiplicative reasoning. Outcomes
   based on pre- and post-tests administered by the Subject Advisers
   suggested substantial pre- to post-test improvement at the student
   level. Subject Adviser observations and reflections pointed to successes
   in engendering more dialogic conversations between mathematics teachers
   and mathematics teacher educators focused on mathematics and its
   teaching and learning. The `double move' of increasing overlap between
   the subject adviser and teacher communities, coupled with evidence that
   implementing the intervention had enabled the Subject Advisers to
   develop their mathematical and pedagogical understandings, provides a
   useful way of considering development in the capacity of mathematics
   teacher educators to support mathematics teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {Many researchers have illustrated the multi-faceted nature of classroom
   mathematics discussions, but few have demonstrated the effect of
   discussion on students' assessment performance. We developed and
   employed a discussion observation instrument in 20 third and fourth
   grade classrooms in an economically disadvantaged, linguistically
   diverse school district and used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to
   determine whether between-class variation in word-problem-test scores
   can be explained by levels of class discussion. Results suggest overall
   class discussion scores, as well as two specific discussion features,
   variety of approaches and opportunities to speak, are significantly
   related to test performance. These results suggest classroom instruction
   including high-level math discussion may improve students' performance
   on written measures of achievement.},

Abstract = {Formal teacher preparation programs are facing the challenge of
   ineffective instruction of educational theories. It is partly because
   educational theories are taught through direct instruction, which could
   lead to problems such as impersonality and low motivation of pre-service
   teachers. In addition, it is also an unwieldy task for teacher educators
   to cover meaningfully a tremendous amount of theories through direct
   instruction within a limited time. This study presents an innovative
   approach of Inquiry-based Pedagogical Instruction (IPI) as a possible
   solution. The IPI approach has two key features: explicit modeling and
   scaffolding. In this quasi-experimental study, I compare IPI and direct
   instruction in promoting preservice teachers' competence in terms of
   their knowledge associated with science teaching and their disposition
   in terms of their sense of belonging to science and science teaching.
   The participants are 39 preservice teachers in Phase 1 with 23 of them
   receiving IPI and the other 16 receiving direct instruction and 92
   preservice teachers in Phase 2 with 42 receiving IPI and 50 receiving
   direct instruction. The results from two-way ANOVA and effect size
   analyses suggest that IPI is a promising alternative to direct
   instruction for the instruction of pedagogical knowledge. IPI has the
   potential to empower pre-service teachers with the competence and
   disposition with which they are capable and willing to construct their
   knowledge of teaching. Implications for future research are also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Many scholars call for teacher educators to provide experiences that can
   lead prospective teachers to adopt and implement culturally responsive
   pedagogy in mathematics classrooms. This qualitative investigation
   analyzed interviews from preservice secondary mathematics teachers using
   Hernandez, Shroyer, and Morales framework for culturally responsive
   mathematics teaching. Analysis of the data demonstrates how preservice
   teachers grapple with enacting a culturally responsive framework at
   practicum sites. Findings reveal that while some participants reported
   comfort implementing some aspects of culturally responsive practices at
   placement sites, others reported apprehension. The data suggests
   strategies for teacher educators interested in supporting culturally
   responsive teacher-learners through professional modeling.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to identify misconceptions of 1st year and 4th year
   pre-service science teachers about the greenhouse effect. A
   questionnaire developed by Boyes and Stanisstreet (Journal of Science
   Education and Technology, 2(4), 541-557, 1993) was administered to 163
   pre-service science teachers in the College of Education at Kuwait
   University. The questionnaire consisted of 36 statements scored on a
   three-point Likert scale. The statements were arranged into three
   sections each containing 12 statements. Using means, frequency,
   percentage, and t test, the results indicated that most pre-service
   science teachers have some misconceptions about ozone layer, global
   warming, and issues related with causes, consequences of the greenhouse
   effect and the ways to alleviate its effect.},

Title = {A Holistic Picture of Physics Student Conceptions of Energy
   Quantization, the Photon Concept, and Light Quanta Interference},

Abstract = {A detailed investigation of student conceptions of quantum phenomena is
   needed, both to characterize student understanding of quantum concepts
   and to inform how we might teach quantum mechanics (QM). In this vein,
   in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 35 students who
   majored in physics and received university-level QM instructions.
   Interview protocols were used and based on three quantum contexts: the
   quantization of energy in explaining the blackbody radiation, the photon
   concept in explaining the photoelectric effect, and light quanta in
   explaining the gradual formation of an interference pattern in the cases
   of low-intensity light beam. By applying a developmental
   phenomenographic analysis of the interview responses, three description
   categories (i.e., general patterns behind the conceptual understandings
   used in explaining each quantum contexts) were identified. These
   categories of descriptions revealed that most students' thinking
   regarding foundational concepts in QM ranged from naive and deficient
   descriptions based on classical ontologies to simple hybrid and/or mixed
   models of classical and quantum conceptions. Regarding learning QM, the
   study found that the perspective of naive and classical ontologies in
   explaining quantum phenomena influenced students' responses; they made
   incorrect generalizations and/or inappropriate links to the concepts
   learned in classical physics; and patterns of incorrect notions of QM
   are analogous to those that were documented. Besides, the study
   confirmed that students' conceptual difficulties with QM are real,
   stable over time, and cross-cultural. It seems that the challenge to
   make QM interesting, effective, and relevant for physics students is a
   universal concern that knows no boundaries.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the nature of global
   argumentation structures of prospective middle school mathematics
   teachers in a technology enhanced environment. A qualitative case study
   was conducted with 8 participants from an Elementary Mathematics
   Education undergraduate program of one of the public universities in
   Ankara. Two implementations, 1 of which included 2 geometry tasks on
   triangles and another which included 2 geometry tasks based on circles,
   were conducted. Subsequently, global argumentation structures were
   revealed via data analysis. The findings indicated that the prospective
   middle school mathematics teachers resort frequently to simple global
   argumentation structures since their mathematical reasoning was
   insufficient. On the other hand, technology had a positive impact on
   argument construction and global argumentation structures of prospective
   middle school mathematics teachers. However, it was deduced that
   prospective middle school mathematics teachers need to be challenged on
   argumentation and about how to facilitate argumentation effectively in
   their future classroom experiences.},

Abstract = {This study provides psychometric data for the Scholastic Inquiry
   Observation instrument and 6years of research data from an inquiry-based
   professional training program. The rating instrument provides a resource
   for measuring 16 inquiry-related learning activities based on level of
   inquiry implementation and level of active student engagement.
   Observational data at the item level can be useful for inquiry-based
   professional development programs. Four scale score options are
   available for inquiry summarization (Inquiry Implementation for
   Hypothesis Usage; Implementation of Inquiry Communication; Student
   Engagement in Hypothesis Usage; Student Engagement in Inquiry
   Communication) and two scales measuring Student Interest and Mastery of
   Objectives. Comparisons of the types of inquiry most commonly used and
   those with the highest levels of active participation by middle school
   students in science and math classrooms are provided.},

Abstract = {In the present paper, we report on the idea of exchanging educational
   innovations across European countries aiming to shed light on the
   following question: how feasible and useful is it to transfer an
   innovation across different national educational settings? The
   innovation, in this case, Inquiry-Based Teaching Learning Sequences, is
   recognized as a crucial component of renewal science teaching in
   European countries. Two local working groups from two different
   Universities, in Finland and Greece, were created consisting of
   researchers and experienced primary teachers. The transfer from Greece
   to Finland was rather challenging because of the differences between the
   two educational contexts. The initial, as well as the revised Teaching
   Learning Sequence, were implemented for 11-12-year-old students
   including the content to be taught, that is Floating-Sinking phenomena
   and density, and the learning environment aspects such as learning
   Control of Variables Strategy. A combination of qualitative and
   quantitative research methods was implemented in order to formulate
   concrete recommendations on feasible and useful aspect. The feasible
   aspect adduces answers to the query of ``how{''} this transfer worked in
   practice. Concerning this aspect, the recognition of what is innovative
   for each national partner was recognized as a crucial factor for the
   design and revision of both Teaching Learning Sequences. The useful
   aspect illuminates students' improvement in the achievement of
   conceptual as well as procedural knowledge. The results revealed that
   the psychological paths that bring about this success are ecumenical and
   independent of the history of the educational group.},

Abstract = {The current study examines the mental computation performance owned by
   students at fifth grade. This study was carried out with 118 fifth
   graders (11-12-year-olds) studying at 3 randomly selected primary
   schools that served low and middle socio-economic areas in a city of
   Turkey. ``Mental Computation Test (MCT){''} has been used to reach how
   participants mentally compute. In analysing data, participants' scores
   on the test were calculated by using a statistical package and which
   mental computation level they were in was determined. Sample responses
   of the some students regarding some questions in the test were presented
   directly and discussed. Evidence was found that the total percentage of
   the students at quite low and low level is 7.6 \% and at high and quite
   high level is calculated to be 78.8 \%. It was also revealed that the
   mental computation performances of the students in addition and
   subtraction are better than multiplication and division. On the other
   hand, it was found out that the performances of the students in all
   operations decrease as the number of the digits increases.},

Abstract = {Recent research on the phenomenon of improper proportional reasoning
   focused on students' understanding of elementary functions and their
   external representations. So far, the role of basic function properties
   in students' concept images of functions remained unclear. We add to
   this research line by investigating how accurate students are in
   connecting functions to their corresponding properties and how this
   accuracy depends on function types and representations. A large group of
   10th graders evaluated for different function types, represented in
   either a graphical, a formulaic, or a tabular mode, the correctness of
   statements about their general properties and behavior. Results show
   that students succeeded rather well in making the right connections
   between properties and functions. Errors depended not only on the type
   of function for which the properties were evaluated but also on the kind
   of representation in which the function was presented. These results
   highlight the importance of function properties in students' concept
   images of functions and suggest positive effects of making these
   properties explicit to students.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the potential
   interrelationships between teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching
   (MKT) the function concept and their students' learning outcomes of this
   concept. Data were collected from two teachers teaching in a vocational
   high school and their students through a function concept test for
   teachers and students, follow-up interviews with teachers, and classroom
   observations. Findings indicated that teachers' MKT and students'
   learning outcomes were related to a degree, but this relationship was
   not straightforward. The data suggested that the teachers' knowledge
   influenced the quality of their instructional practices, and the
   instructional practices played a mediating role in student learning.
   Different factors contributing to student learning were also evident.},

Abstract = {For science teachers using the discourse of socioscientific issues
   (SSI), it is important to make a decision as to whether when and how to
   disclose their own positions. The existing limited literature shows that
   science teachers prefer one of four roles during SSI discourse: sticker
   to facts, imposer, democracy advocator, and committed impartialist. The
   purpose of the present research is to understand the nature of
   preservice science teachers' (PST) beliefs underlying such selection.
   Based on existing literature, we developed a teacher's belief
   questionnaire including vignettes representing four teacher's roles in
   discussion of genetically modified (GM) foods. Three hundred twenty-four
   (324) PSTs from a Turkish context experiencing SSI-based reforms
   completed these questionnaires, selected one of the teacher's roles, and
   justified their selection by writing reasons. Content analysis
   procedures were used in data analysis of this qualitative study. The
   results show that most PSTs selected dialogical roles (democracy
   advocators and committed impartialists). Looking at their beliefs,
   epistemologies and teaching goals work together in PSTs' selection of
   their preferred role. In addition, we argue that there is no desired
   alignment between teachers' existing beliefs and expectations of SSI
   reforms. We conclude by indicating certain implications that may enhance
   such alignment.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a transformative modeling framework that guides the
   development of assessment to measure students' deep understanding in
   physical sciences. The framework emphasizes 3 types of connections that
   students need to make when learning physical sciences: (1) linking
   physical states, processes, and explanatory models, (2) integrating
   multiple explanatory models, and (3) connecting scientific models to
   concrete experiences. We carried out a 2-phase exploratory study that
   helped further develop and refine the framework. In the first phase, we
   developed 3 items on sinking and floating and pilot tested them with 18
   undergraduate students. Analysis of student responses revealed various
   student misconceptions and the different connections students made among
   science ideas. Based on the findings, we revised the assessment,
   modified the instruction, and collected data from another cohort of 26
   students. The second cohort of students showed significant improvement
   of understanding of sinking and floating after instruction. Implications
   and limitations of how our assessment framework can be used to improve
   students' conceptual understanding in science are discussed.},

Abstract = {Individual level data for the entire cohort of undergraduate mathematics
   students of a relatively small US public university was used to estimate
   the risk that a student will switch major to another one before degree
   completion. The data set covers the period from 1999 to 2006. Survival
   tables and logistic models were estimated and used to discuss student's
   switch from their initially planned mathematics major to another. An
   important goal of low enrollment university departments is to increase
   enrollment and to attain a high retention rate. Major switching
   indicates a failure of these departments to retain potentially able
   students. Students' retention is also an important issue for university
   programs evaluation and funding. The goal of this work is to investigate
   the timing of switching major, to a different one, by mathematics
   students. We estimated the probability of occurrence of this event for
   different school terms and when this event is most likely to occur. The
   empirical results suggest that the probability of a mathematics student
   switching major varies from a high 23 \% early in student's major
   enrollment to a low of about 6 \% in later semesters. Mathematics
   education majors, however, showed inferior risk of switching major.
   Gender differences were also examined, showing no significant gender
   differences.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate plane geometry problem-solving strategies
   of prospective mathematics teachers using dynamic geometry software
   (DGS) and paper-and-pencil (PPB) environments after receiving an
   instruction with GeoGebra (GGB). Four plane geometry problems were used
   in a multiple case study design to understand the solution strategies
   developed by 2 prospective teachers. The results revealed that although
   the participants mostly used algebraic solutions in the PPB environment,
   they preferred geometric solutions in the GGB environment even though
   algebraic solutions were still possible (the software did not preclude
   them). Furthermore, different proofing strategies were developed in each
   environment. This suggests that changing the environment may prompt
   students to seek for additional solutions, which, in turn, results in a
   deeper understanding of the problem. As such, using both environments
   simultaneously in solving the same problems appears to bring about
   important benefits.},

Abstract = {Students' affective domain has been popular in the mathematics education
   community in an ongoing attempt to understand students' learning
   behavior. Specifically, enhancing students' motivation in the
   mathematics classroom is an important issue for teachers and
   researchers, due to its relation to students' behavior and achievement.
   This paper utilized achievement goal theory-an important theoretical
   prospect on students' motivation in school settings-to investigate the
   existence of a model presenting the relation between motivation and
   other affective constructs and students' performance in mathematics. In
   this regard, two types of tests were administered to 321 sixth grade
   students measuring their motivation and other affective constructs and
   their performance in mathematics. Using structural equation modeling, we
   examined the associations among the affective constructs, motivation,
   and the extent to which these constructs influence students' performance
   and interest in mathematics. The data revealed that students'
   performance and their interest in mathematics were influenced by fear of
   failure, self-efficacy beliefs, and achievement goals. We discuss these
   findings in terms of teaching implications in the mathematics classroom.},

Abstract = {Teachers' subject-specific cognition is seen as an important factor for
   the quality of instruction and, accordingly, student learning. However,
   in-depth research on these relations can only be carried out if a sound
   theoretical model for subject-specific teacher cognition (knowledge and
   competence/practical skills) and-in the case of a quantitative research
   approach-corresponding measures are available. The subject-specific
   cognition can be modeled as basic professional knowledge (BK)
   complemented by two further components of reflective competence (RC) and
   action-related competence (AC) with a close connection to professional
   demands. In order to implement these subject-specific demands
   rigorously, we developed innovative standardized measures for primary
   mathematics teachers. In particular, we argue that video-based items
   that are implemented in a speed condition and rated as holistic
   observations are well suited to realize the assessment of action-related
   competence. This article gives a detailed insight into the test
   development as well as the coding and scoring procedure and focuses on
   validation efforts. The study is based on the data of 85 in-service
   primary mathematics teachers and shows the viability of the approach.
   Classical scale analyses as well as confirmatory factor analyses and the
   comparison of different models as well as teacher groups (mathematics
   certified vs. non-mathematics certified teachers) give evidence for the
   validity and reliability of the measures.},

Abstract = {It is well established that teacher-student interactive talk is
   critically important in supporting students to reason and learn in
   science. Teachers' discursive moves in responding to student input are
   keys to developing and supporting a rich vein of interactive discussion.
   While initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) sequences have been shown to
   dominate science classroom discourse patterns worldwide, teacher
   `prompts' are important for opening up opportunities for reasoning and
   higher level learning. This paper describes the analysis of video
   sequences for five expert elementary teachers across three countries to
   develop a coding scheme for these teachers' `discursive moves' to guide
   and respond to student inputs, that unpacks more completely the
   strategies they use to develop interactive discussion. The analysis
   showed varied patterns of knowledge transaction, with teacher discursive
   moves serving three broad purposes: to elicit and acknowledge student
   responses, to clarify and to extend student ideas. The patterns of talk
   were also related to the dialogic-authoritative distinction in analysis
   of talk, to show that this distinction is only clear for particular
   types of expert practice. While the particular moves teachers use vary
   across parts of lessons we argue that they are revealing of teachers'
   particular beliefs and of systemic constraints, and that there exist
   patterns in the use of the discursive categories that capture how expert
   teachers build deeper level knowledge in classroom interactive talk. We
   describe ways in which the analysis can inform science teacher education
   and the professional learning of teachers of science.},

Abstract = {This study explored learning competency based on the Indonesian National
   Examination focusing especially on chemistry performance and the
   circumstances of senior high school students and teachers in rural areas
   of Simeulue Island, Indonesia. The National Examination total score and
   chemistry score for students in rural areas were consistently lower than
   students in urban areas during 2008-2010. The majority of rural students
   were failing to master key chemistry concepts. Their low performance on
   laboratory-based questions appeared to indicate that the associated
   practical work was not done as part of the chemistry courses. Some
   chemistry topics were not taught due to insufficient time, student
   weaknesses, insufficient textbooks, and other reasons. The issues of low
   competency of teachers, poverty for the majority of students, low
   enrollment in schools, and low competition among students in these rural
   senior high schools appeared to be common problems across rural
   settings. The local government has recommended providing a consolidated
   rural high school with qualified chemistry teachers, laboratories, and
   transportation to address factors negatively influencing student
   achievement. Furthermore, local rural school officials need to recruit
   and retain qualified teachers in these isolated areas, provide effective
   textbooks and instructional resources, and facilitate the professional
   development of chemistry teachers.},

Abstract = {This study used the data set from the Teacher Education and Development
   Study in Mathematics to identify the profiles of opportunities to learn
   (OTL) regarding topics studied in teacher preparation programs by future
   secondary mathematics teachers from 15 participating countries. The
   topics of inquiry covered tertiary-level mathematics, school-level
   mathematics, mathematics education, and general education. Dominating
   OTL profiles across and within countries were identified and compared
   with those examined by Blomeke \& Kaiser (ZDM 44(3):249-264, 2012) at
   the primary level. Our results show that, for tertiary-level
   mathematics, the secondary level demands intensive and extensive
   coverage of topics, whereas the primary level appears to have a two-peak
   phenomenon compared to the secondary level. The preparation philosophies
   in mathematics education are homogeneous at both school levels, although
   the secondary level placed more emphasis on facilitating students'
   cognitive understanding and cultivating students' mathematical
   abilities. Regarding general education, two philosophies prevailed at
   the secondary level: (a) comprehensive coverage or (b) only focusing on
   the OTL that are related to school practice; however, at the primary
   level, only the first philosophy prevailed.},

Abstract = {Using the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2003
   data, this study built mathematics achievement models of 8th graders in
   four countries: the USA, Russia, Singapore and South Africa. These 4
   countries represent the full spectrum of mathematics achievement. In
   addition, they represent 4 continents, and they include 2 countries
   hugely influential in world events (the USA and Russia). In each
   country, students' self-concept of ability in mathematics, mathematics
   values, perception of school, teachers' and principals' perceptions of
   school and other characteristics related to the classroom and school
   were incorporated to build an achievement model through hierarchical
   linear modelling. The final achievement models suggested that among
   student variables, self-concept of ability in mathematics had the
   highest relation to 8th graders' mathematics achievement in all 4
   countries. The relation between mathematics achievement and other
   student characteristics, along with the family, teacher and school
   variables, differed across the 4 countries. This suggests that
   self-concept of ability is a key variable for understanding achievement
   in high and low achieving countries and that other contextual variables
   vary in the magnitude of relations to mathematics achievement across
   countries.},

Abstract = {Every day, climate change due to greenhouse emissions, pollution and
   other environmental degradation appears to make the news. Rather than
   doing something about the environment, namely in the developing
   countries where populations frequently are less educated about the
   long-term impact of human actions, they tend to disregard these
   problems. There is therefore a need particularly in developing countries
   to increase the potential for understanding and acting in sustainable,
   environmentally friendly ways. In this paper, we report quantitative and
   qualitative results of shifts in environmental value orientations among
   110 Malaysian pre-service chemistry teachers during their enrolment in a
   green chemistry course. We find that the pre-service teachers'
   environmental value orientations become more ecocentric and less
   homocentric and egocentric. Ecocentrism and ecocentric values support
   the development of behaviours that will assist them and the students
   they teach in leading environmentally sustainable lifestyles. We
   conclude that our green chemistry course constitutes (a) a suitable
   context for supporting pre-service teachers in their development of
   ecocentric values and (b) an effort to educate the pre-service teachers
   in leading sustainable lifestyles.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article was to describe the task design and
   implementation of cultural artefacts in a mathematics lesson based on
   the integration of modelling and conjecturing perspectives. The
   conceived process of integrating a soccer ball into mathematics lessons
   via modelling- and conjecturing-based instruction was first detailed.
   Next, the paper analysed six students' participation behaviours as they
   created mathematical problems, definitions, terms, representations and
   arguments during modelling and conjecturing activities. Findings
   suggested students effectively engaged in the search for soccer ball
   models and solutions to posed questions, especially the reason
   manufacturers prefer soccer balls constructed from regular pentagons and
   regular hexagons to other types of regular polygons.},

Abstract = {Student mastery of rational number and proportional reasoning is a
   recognized challenge, yet supporting mastery is central within
   mathematics and science. This paper focuses on a 4-lesson teaching
   programme which was designed to foster mastery in the context of
   intensive quantities. Intensive quantities such as density, speed and
   temperature depend upon proportional relations, require rational number
   for their representation and are relevant to science. Two versions of
   the teaching programme were developed, one using ratio representation
   and the other using fractions. Implementation with 535 children aged
   9-11 years revealed that both versions promoted mastery of fractions,
   whilst the ratio version also supported proportional reasoning. It is
   suggested that the ratio version provides useful foundations for
   teaching, even with children who, as with the present sample, have no
   previous experience of ratios themselves.},

Abstract = {Based on the multidisciplinary field of multimodality, this paper offers
   a theoretical perspective on the construct of a curricular concept which
   is commonly used in a school curriculum and applies it to an analysis of
   a typical curricular text and classroom instruction that exposit the
   physics concept of work-energy. Theorizing a concept as a network of
   meaning relationships across multiple modes of representation situated
   in human activity, this approach examines how we can recognize the
   meaning constructed through the semantic relationships of language and
   its contextualization with pictorial, graphical, and numerical
   resources. The value of this approach to curriculum and instruction in
   formal educational settings is also presented.},

Abstract = {To monitor and evaluate program success and to provide teachers with a
   tool that could support their transformation in teaching practice, we
   needed an effective and valid protocol to measure the quantity and
   quality of inquiry-based instruction being led. Existing protocols,
   though helpful, were either too generic or too program specific.
   Consequently, we developed the Electronic Quality of Inquiry Protocol
   (EQUIP). This manuscript examines the 2-year development cycle for the
   creation and validation of EQUIP. The protocol evolved over several
   iterations and was supported by validity checks and confirmatory factor
   analysis. The protocol's strength is further supported by high internal
   consistency and solid interrater agreement. The resulting protocol
   assesses 19 indicators aligned with four constructs: instruction,
   curriculum, assessment, and discourse. For teachers, EQUIP provides a
   framework to make their instructional practice more intentional as they
   strive to increase the quantity and quality of inquiry instruction. For
   researchers, EQUIP provides an instrument to analyze the quantity and
   quality of inquiry being implemented, which can be beneficial in
   evaluating professional development projects.},

Abstract = {This article reports an alternative approach, called the combinatorial
   model, to learning multiplicative identities, and investigates the
   effects of implementing results for this alternative approach. Based on
   realistic mathematics education theory, the new instructional materials
   or modules of the new approach were developed by the authors. From the
   combinatorial activities based on the things around daily life, the
   teaching modules assisted students to establish their concept of the
   distributive law, and to generalize it via the process of progressive
   mathematizing. The subjects were two classes of 8th graders. The
   experimental group (n=32) received a combinatorial approach to teaching
   by the first author using a problem-centered with double-cycles
   instructional model, while the control group (n=30) received a geometric
   approach to teaching, from the textbook by another teacher who uses
   lecturing. Data analyses were both qualitative and quantitative. The
   findings indicated that the experimental group had a better performance
   than the control group in cognition, such as for the inner-school
   achievement test, mid-term examination, symbol manipulation, and
   unfamiliar problem-solving: also in affection, such as the tendency to
   engage in the mathematics activities and enjoy mathematical thinking.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the approaches to teaching by three fifth-grade
   teachers' of creative and non-creative mathematical problems for
   fractions. The teachers' personal constructs of the two kinds of
   problems were elicited by interviews through the use of the repertory
   grid technique. All the teaching was observed and video-recorded.
   Results revealed that the teachers had slightly distinctive constructs
   of creative and non-creative problems, and professed a greater
   preference for creative problems. Based on the teachers' creations of
   problems in classrooms and related features, the study identified three
   types of teaching approaches: liberal, reasoning, and skill approaches.
   The liberal approach appeared to indicate the most appropriate teaching
   methods for creative problems.},

Abstract = {The results from tests set as part of a large mathematics teaching
   development project are explored using both quantitative and qualitative
   methods to seek differences in performance between boys and girls. The
   outcome appears to confirm the theory developed from earlier research

   approach their studies in mathematics on the basis of seeking and
   applying rules and procedures. Following a brief overview of related
   research and description of the project background, the paper describes
   the processes of exploratory data analysis used and discusses the
   outcomes observed.},

Abstract = {In their recent article on teachers' proportional reasoning,
   Copur-Gencturk et al. (2022) draw attention to a type of strategy that
   they call ``relative{''}, lodged right between additive and
   multiplicative thinking. This strategy raised interest in our research
   team, as it aligned well and helped give stronger meaning to some
   strategies obtained during a series of individual interviews on solving
   proportionality tasks. Using that ``relative proportional reasoning{''}
   lens, this article explores several strategies engaged in by two
   students (11 and 13 years old) and in doing so outlines a number of
   dimensions about proportional reasoning that these strategies enable to
   draw out. The detailed consideration of this relative proportional
   reasoning raises important questions as to its possible role in the
   difficult transition from additive to multiplicative thinking in
   proportionality, opening the door to further inquiries on these matters.},

Abstract = {Students with high reading proficiency typically achieve better results
   in science assessments, indicating the importance of reading
   proficiency. Since the process of reading is a complex interaction
   between properties of a text and a reader, the linguistic demands of a
   text might affect text comprehension. Certain linguistic features, such
   as complex syntactic structures and low word frequency, have been found
   to create higher cognitive load. However, studies investigating the
   influence of linguistic features on test item difficulty and students'
   text comprehension in science have hitherto let to inconclusive results.
   The present study investigates whether the linguistic demands of
   expository text affect German students' text comprehension in the domain
   of physics. Within an experimental study, we presented three
   introductory texts on different subtopics of thermodynamics and 27
   single-select, multiple-choice items to 812 secondary school students
   (grades 7-9). Items measured students' text comprehension (dependent
   variable); the linguistic demands of each text were systematically
   varied across three levels (independent variables) while other features
   of text quality and content were held constant. The results of the item
   response theory analysis indicated no consistent differences in item
   difficulty across levels of linguistic demands. Moreover, differential
   analyses of subgroups presented no consistent differences in solution
   frequencies of items related to different linguistic demands.
   Furthermore, while the highest linguistic demand of the texts led the
   students to perceive a lower comprehensibility, their text comprehension
   was not affected. Hence, this study provides evidence that the influence
   of linguistic features on text comprehension is at most low and might be
   overestimated in present discussions.},

Abstract = {External representations such as diagrams often appear in teachers'
   repertoire of pedagogical tools to support students' conceptual learning
   and problem-solving activities. The study of diagrams and diagrammatic
   representations has received growing interest from diverse disciplines.
   Diagrams remain a central feature of science, technology, engineering,
   and mathematics (STEM) learning areas, in schools and beyond. This study
   examined teachers' perceptions of diagrams in mathematics, focusing on
   two aspects. The first was teachers' perceptions on the utility value of
   diagrams and how they incorporate them in their instructional practice
   to communicate and make connections between mathematical ideas. The
   second was teachers' perceptions about their students' use of diagrams
   in mathematics. An open-ended survey was administered to 20 secondary
   school (grades 7 to 10) teachers, with at least 3 years of mathematics
   teaching experience. The findings show that teachers perceived diagrams
   primarily as a tool for communication of mathematical ideas during
   instruction. To a lesser extent, they used diagrams to link concepts
   within and between topics, and as a tool in any part of problem-solving.
   Some of the challenges they perceived that students may encounter with
   diagrams were the lack of diagram-specific skills, cognitive demand of
   constructing diagrams, and less than proficient visuospatial abilities
   to decode and extract pertinent information. The possible reasons for
   these findings are discussed with the support of existing literature and
   inform potential teacher learning programmes and serve as a springboard
   for future research.},

Abstract = {This report focuses on the ways in which 36 Grade 4 students recognized,
   explained, described, and employed variation during interviews conducted
   1 month after participating in STEM-based activities in which they
   tested, adjusted, and re-tested catapults. An inductive thematic
   methodology was used for analysis of the interview transcripts to
   capture the ways in which students discussed their analyses and
   justified their conclusions from the activity. The results were based on
   1080 instances of variation in student responses to the interview
   questions, which evidenced three ways students characterized variation:
   contextual variation, specific variation, and general variation.
   Findings point to the essential nature of context in building
   statistical understanding in relation to both specific and general
   aspects of variation as well as decision-making in that context.},

Abstract = {This research study investigated conceptions about buoyancy held by 55
   elementary preservice teachers enrolled in a science methods course who
   participated in an instructional intervention designed to increase their
   knowledge about buoyancy. Pre- and post-concept maps were analyzed using
   a paired sample t test and thematic analysis was used to interpret
   narratives, drawings, and interview data. There was a statistically
   significant difference (t = -3.504, p = .001) in the total number of
   scientifically correct concepts for the pre-concept maps (M = 0.51, SD =
   .879) and post-concept maps (M = 1.25, SD = 1.542). The total number of
   accurate propositions increased between the pre- and post-concept maps.
   The drawings revealed that most participants (66\%) had alternative
   conceptions about how gravity is related to buoyancy and the role it
   plays in floating and sinking. Data from the interviews triangulated
   with other data sources that showed gains in scientific conceptions such
   as opposing forces (53\%) and surface area (33\%), while documenting the
   persistence of serious alternative conceptions about floating and
   sinking (49\%), the key role of fluid density (56\%), and density of an
   object (62\%).},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine mathematicians' views on the value of advanced
   mathematics for secondary mathematics teachers. The data comprise
   semi-structured interviews with 24 mathematicians from 10 universities.
   The findings indicate that the value of advanced mathematics courses for
   prospective secondary mathematics teachers lies in their potential to
   offer connections across mathematical domains, mathematical experience
   for the development of problem-solving abilities, and increased
   epistemological awareness of the subject. Additionally, mathematicians'
   examples that connect advanced and school mathematics are presented and
   discussed. While the mathematicians provided rich examples of such
   connections, we noted that such examples were relatively scarce and
   accordingly sought possible explanations in the discussion of the
   findings.},

Abstract = {Although physical hands-on laboratory experiments are commonly used in
   schools, virtual laboratory environments are also being used in science
   classrooms. Their possibilities and impact on students' achievement,
   conceptual understanding, and inquiry skills have been investigated by
   other researchers. Yet, it is difficult to find studies about the effect
   of virtual learning environments on written argumentation in science
   classrooms. In the current study, the influence of hands-on and virtual
   laboratories on pre-service science teachers' scientific writing was
   investigated using the science writing heuristic. The participants were
   52 pre-service science teachers who were assigned to two conditions. One
   group used the hands-on laboratory to design and implement experiments
   and used a paper-based worksheet to write their arguments; the other
   group did their investigations through a computer-based virtual-tool
   laboratory and wrote their arguments on the online learning platform.
   Pre-service science teachers' written arguments were evaluated using
   content analysis. The findings revealed that the overall quality of
   written arguments created by pre-service science teachers in both
   laboratory environments was at an intermediate level. Furthermore,
   pre-service science teachers who learned in the virtual laboratory posed
   better testable questions, presented strong and valid evidence, and used
   multiple representations better than their counterparts in the hands-on
   laboratory. An important conclusion of the current study is that the
   science writing heuristic can be used effectively in both virtual and
   hands-on laboratory environments.},

Abstract = {In this study, to facilitate the integration of environmental education
   in science curricula and achieve a more sustainable future, the
   relationships among scientific epistemic views, decision-making style,
   and recycling intention based on the theory of planned behavior were
   investigated. Three instruments (i.e. SEVs, DMS, and RI) were
   implemented on a sample of 515 Taiwanese high school students and
   revealed sufficient validity and reliability by employing exploratory
   and confirmatory factor analyses. Structural equation modeling analysis
   showed that students' scientific epistemic views do not directly link to
   recycling intention, whereas SEVs predict decision-making styles and
   decision-making styles predict recycling intention. The research
   findings suggest that teachers might consider encouraging students to
   develop the ability to think deeply and holistically by adopting the
   scientific approach in environmental education. This research also
   provided important information for educators to deliver environmental
   education effectively under the environment of Confucian culture.
   Limitations of the study and future research recommendations are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Given the importance of cultivating scientific literate societies, the
   integration of scientific inquiry into school curriculum is key to
   contemporary science education. It is apparent that textbooks have been
   an accessible source of science information for teachers and students
   since the growth of public K-12 schooling worldwide. Textbooks are
   crucial for understanding the basis of science curriculum, since many
   science teachers design their courses according to textbook content.
   This study aimed to determine whether the activities (both experiments
   and student activities) in Turkish biology textbooks reflect
   contemporary inquiry-based approaches. To this end, the sample of the
   study was composed of four biology textbooks approved by the Turkish
   Ministry of National Education (MoNE) for grades 9-12. Analysis of these
   textbooks was conducted using the Inquiry-Based Tasks Analysis Inventory
   (ITAI). The overall findings indicate that activities in textbooks were
   mostly compatible with the established curriculum, but they were
   insufficiently designed to prepare students todoinquiry or
   tounderstandwhat scientific inquiry is. Results demonstrated that these
   textbooks' most considered ITAI dimension wasConstruction of
   Understandings about Scientific Concepts, while the least frequently
   explored dimension wasUnderstandings about Scientific Inquiry.
   Additionally, in theExpected skillsdimension,observingandinferringwere

Abstract = {Educational data mining is used to discover significant phenomena and
   resolve educational issues occurring in the context of teaching and
   learning. This study provides a systematic literature review of
   educational data mining in mathematics and science education. A total of
   64 articles were reviewed in terms of the research topics and data
   mining techniques used. This review revealed that data mining in
   mathematics and science education has been commonly used to understand
   students' behavior and thinking process, identify factors affecting
   student achievements, and provide automated assessment of students'
   written work. Recently, researchers have tended to use such data mining
   techniques as text mining to develop learning systems for supporting
   teachers' instruction and students' learning. We also found that
   classification, text mining, and clustering are major data mining
   techniques researchers have used. Studies using data mining were more
   likely to be conducted in the field of science education than in the
   field of mathematics education. We discuss the main results of our
   review in comparison with the previous reviews of educational data
   mining (EDM) literature and with EDM studies conducted in the context of
   science and mathematics education. Finally, we provide implications for
   research and teaching and learning of science and mathematics and
   suggest potential research directions.},

Abstract = {This study was aimed to develop a general argumentation framework for
   evaluating the quality of causal arguments across scientific and social
   contexts. We designed a computer-delivered assessment that contains four
   scenario-based argumentation tasks. Each task asks students to identify
   relevant evidence from provided data sources and use the evidence to
   construct an argument that answers a causal question. One task is about
   a social issue, while the rest three tasks each requires knowledge of a
   scientific concept (melting/evaporation, photosynthesis, trophic
   cascade). The assessment was implemented with 349 students from urban
   middle and high schools. Based on the data and prior research, we
   developed an empirically grounded argumentation framework that contains
   four qualitatively different levels: non-causal arguments, causal
   arguments lacking logical connections, causal arguments with weak
   reasoning, and causal arguments with strong reasoning. The qualitative
   results provide evidence of the existence of the argumentation levels.
   The IRT analysis and the Wright map provide the evidence that the order
   of and the distinctions among the argumentation levels are meaningful.
   Together, the qualitative and quantitative results support the viability
   of the framework.},

Abstract = {This article addresses physics teachers' views about physics teaching in
   upper-secondary school. Their views have been investigated nationwide
   through a web-based questionnaire. The questionnaire has been developed
   based on several published instruments and is part of an ongoing project
   on the role of mathematics in physics teaching at upper-secondary
   school. The selected part of the results from the analysis of the
   questionnaire reported on here cross-correlate physics teachers' views
   about aims of physics teaching with their view of physics classroom
   activities, and perceived hindrances in the teaching of physics. Three
   hundred seventy-nine teachers responded to the questionnaire (45\%
   response rate). The result indicates that teachers with a high agreement
   with a Fundamental Physics curriculum emphasis regarded mathematics as a
   problem for physics teaching, whereas teachers with high agreement with
   the curriculum emphases Physics, Technology and Society or Knowledge
   Development in Physics did not do so. This means that teachers with a
   main focus on fundamental theories and concepts believe that mathematics
   is a problem to a higher extent than teachers with main focus on the
   role of physics in society and applied aspects or physics knowledge
   development do. Consequences for teaching and further research are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Previous research of math anxiety (MA) was largely concerned with the
   population of high school students. Although there are findings on the
   existence of MA at early primary school age, a very small number of
   questionnaires or scales, which have been validated in several cultures
   and can be used in research with children of this age, have been
   detected in the literature. The aim of this research was the
   psychometric evaluation and short validation of Modified Abbreviated
   Math Anxiety Scale (mAMAS) for children in Serbia. The study was
   conducted on a sample of 301 early elementary school students from
   Serbia (mean age 8.79 years). The results of the research indicate a
   2-factor solution of this scale. Both components, Math Evaluation
   Anxiety and Math Learning Anxiety, have satisfactory reliability
   coefficients and negative relations with math grades. Additionally,
   there were no detected gender differences on these measures. IRT
   analysis indicates that both components show satisfactory psychometric
   properties and all of the items show significant contributions to their
   respective scales. Both scales exhibit similar properties in that they
   offer precise discrimination of respondents with average and higher MA
   levels, which is encouraging as the scale could be used as a screening
   tool for children who experience problems with MA.},

Abstract = {This mixed-method study aims to explore the feasibility of using the
   game-based, multimodal representation of mathematical problems to
   support middle school students' practice and performance of math problem
   representation and solving. A three-dimensional architectural simulation
   game, called E-Rebuild, was developed to engage students in
   architecture-themed math problem solving and learning. Based on the data
   collected from 56 middle graders, the study findings suggested that
   interacting with game-based multimodal math problems helped students
   develop a systematic perspective and an analytical demeanor in
   coordinating external problem representations distributed across game
   objects and actions. Game-based problem solving promoted participants'
   mathematical test performance as well as mental rotation task
   performance.},

Abstract = {In the field of science education, laboratory learning environment has
   gained renewed interest in the recent decade. This study aimed to
   investigate the relationships among students' conceptions of science
   laboratory learning, perceptions of the science laboratory learning
   environment, and their academic self-efficacy in science learning by
   adopting the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. A total of
   513 senior high school students (262 females) in Taiwan were invited to
   participate in this survey study. Three instruments were adapted and
   implemented to investigate the aim of the study (i.e. the conceptions of
   science laboratory learning questionnaire, the science laboratory
   environment inventory, and the academic self-efficacy in science
   learning questionnaire). The results indicated that the students'
   conceptions of science laboratory learning made a significant
   contribution to their perceptions of the science laboratory environment,
   which consequently fostered their science learning self-efficacy. More
   specifically, students with conceptions of science laboratory learning
   as reviewing their prior learning profiles tended to highlight the
   ``student cohesiveness,{''} ``integration,{''} and ``material
   environment{''} aspects of the laboratory environment. Moreover,
   students who held personal ideas of science laboratory learning as
   acquiring manipulative skills tended to perceive actual science
   laboratory environments as much more open-ended and to attain advanced
   academic science learning self-efficacy. In addition, those students who
   viewed laboratory learning as achieving in-depth understanding, and who
   perceived that laboratory activities are guided by clear rules, were
   prone to express a stronger sense of academic self-efficacy. Based on
   the results, practical implications and suggestions for future research
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {In order to participate proficiently in mathematical activity, a student
   needs to become fluent in both mathematical sign activity and speaking
   about the activity with signs. From the theoretical viewpoint of the
   philosophers Wittgenstein and Peirce, on the one hand, mathematics is
   seen as a sign game, while on the other hand experiments with signs
   allow for observable, communicable and describable reasoning. In this
   article, the focus is on the student's sign activity and his or her
   speaking about it and the question of how they are intertwined. To that
   end, a method is presented to display the interplay of student's
   activity with signs and speaking about it, and in particular, to
   reconstruct the student's line of argumentation. This is applied to a
   case study where imaginary dialogues written by a class of grade 11
   students on the topic ``derivative{''} were analyzed.},

Abstract = {Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, in the Greater China
   Region, have similar yet different educational systems and curriculum
   standards, and each has performed well in international tests for
   science achievement. Using revised Bloom's taxonomy, this study analyzed
   and explored the similarities and differences among these four Chinese
   regions. Some common features of their junior high science curricula
   were identified: conceptual knowledge represents the largest proportion
   of the curricula, while meta-cognitive knowledge remains extremely
   marginalized, and the lower levels of cognitive process represented a
   significantly larger proportion of the curricula than the higher levels.
   This study also identified some differences: mainland China, Taiwan, and
   Macao emphasize the memory of factual and conceptual knowledge, while
   Hong Kong emphasizes understanding. In addition to conceptual knowledge,
   Taiwan attaches importance to procedural knowledge, while Hong Kong
   places more emphasis on factual knowledge. Finally, some recommendations
   are offered for the reform of the junior high school science curriculum
   in these four Chinese regions and beyond, and suggestions are made for
   future comparative studies of science curricula around the world.},

Abstract = {Teachers' decision-making and pedagogical reasoning often become visible
   in their lesson planning sessions. This study explores how the
   professional learning opportunities presented by teacher-facilitator
   interactions in planning sessions. By tracing shifts in teachers'
   discourse in planning sessions, we examine the development of their
   pedagogical reasoning. The findings of this study illustrate that these
   interactions create four kinds of professional learning opportunities:
   (1) reflecting on students' learning in past lessons; (2) attending to
   the details of the complexity of teaching; (3) negotiating and adjusting
   lesson goals and activities by making direct and informed decisions for
   teaching; and (4) anticipating specific features of instruction. This
   study also illustrates how refining and elaborating teaching complexity
   supports teachers in re-conceptualizing and expanding their teaching
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {Participation in post-compulsory physics is a matter of longstanding
   concern from both economic and equity perspectives. In considering this
   issue, this study draws upon Bourdieu's theory of social practice,
   particularly notions of the cultural arbitrary', to explore what
   insights into post-compulsory physics choice might be provided by
   students who could have chosen physics, but did not, opting for other
   sciences instead. Utilising survey data from over 13,000 year 11 (ages
   15/16) students in England, as well as qualitative interviews with 70
   students of the same age, findings reinforce the key role of individual
   aspirations in subject choice. However, they also highlight the
   influence of the cultural arbitrary of physics (e.g. as difficult,
   masculine), which leads many students to conclude that physics is not
   for me' and hence choose other paths. This finding emphasises the
   entrenched nature of the challenges facing efforts to increase equity in
   post-compulsory physics participation.},

Abstract = {This study was designed to examine predictors of instructional beliefs
   related to problem solving that influence mathematics in-service
   teachers' practices in the Chilean context. A total of 713 in-service
   mathematics teachers from various elementary schools participated in the
   survey study during 2015 and 2016. Results showed that teachers'
   traditional beliefs are directly associated with their teacher-centered
   practices, while there was an indirect relation among reformed beliefs
   and student-centered practices through teachers' self-efficacy beliefs
   and their beliefs about the value of problem solving. This association
   among beliefs and practices suggests that educators and policy makers
   should be aware of, when designing a teacher professional development,
   the need to emphasize other variables such as teachers' self-efficacy
   and value of the task.},

Abstract = {This study reports on a conceptual model that provides insight into the
   relationship between English reading proficiency and academic
   performance of first-year science and mathematics university students in
   Ghana, and an empirical test of that model. Longitudinal data were
   acquired from a sample of 133 students. Using three different mediation
   analyses, the study demonstrated significant medium-sized effects of
   English reading proficiency on students' grade point average (GPA) by
   the end of year 1 and a small but significant indirect relationship
   between reading proficiency and the final GPA scores by the end of year
   4, mediated by the GPA scores after year 1. These findings show that the
   academic English reading proficiency of students in a non-western
   multilingual academic context is important for their academic
   achievement. It also found that academic results obtained by students in
   their first-year at University were a sound predictor for success at the
   end of their studies. Results from this study confirm the need for
   universities in multilingual settings to invest in L2 students' English
   reading proficiency at the start of their academic programs.
   Instructional recommendations are made, along with suggestions for
   further study.},

Abstract = {This quasi-experimental mixed-methods design examined the effects of a
   Modified Argument-Driven Inquiry (MADI) on elementary school boys' and
   girls' engagement in learning science (ELS) and performance of
   argumentation. Thirty-two children were randomly selected to participate
   in a two-semester 24-h intervention, forming an experimental group (EG,
   13 boys, 19 girls); another 36 children were also randomly selected from
   the same two schools as a comparison group (CG, 20 boys, 16 girls). All
   participants completed pretest and posttest at the beginning and 1month
   after each semester's intervention. A well-structured student
   questionnaire was used to assess the participants' ELS and quality of
   argumentation. In addition, four target children with the highest or the
   lowest scores on pretest were purposively recruited for weekly classroom
   observations and two-wave interviews for triangulation and consolidation
   of quantitative findings. The results from the repeated measures ANOVA
   revealed that the EG boys and girls made significant and continuous
   improvement in the quality of argumentation from the first to the second
   semesters. In contrast, the CG girls presented significantly lower
   scores than the boy counterparts. In addition, the results of the ANCOVA
   measures indicated that the EG girls of high engagement made a
   significant improvement in the quality of argumentation than the girls
   of low engagement. This study provides a fresh insight to support the
   use of a MADI intervention as an effective strategy for improving girls'
   continuous ELS and high quality of argumentation.},

Abstract = {The Human Orrery is a representation of the Solar System at a human
   scale, on which positions of planets over time are symbolized by
   different discs. Learners can then walk along the orbits of the planets
   with the right pace. This pedagogical tool uses the principles of
   enacted cognition to promote a better understanding of the scientific
   laws of dynamics. Enaction assumes that cognition is based on action.
   Applied to pedagogy, it implies that learning of concepts must be based
   on gestures and perceptions first. I applied during 2years an enacted
   pedagogical sequence using our Human Orrery to different populations of
   learners. The main purpose was the understanding of velocity and inertia
   by KS4 classes (14-16years old). Interviews and closed questions reveal
   a qualitative enhancement of the motivation and well-being of the
   learners during the enacted sequence. To evaluate further the impact of
   the enacted sequence, I formulated 2 open questions. The first one
   concerns the relation between distance, duration, and velocity through
   the period of planets. The second one focuses on inertia and gravity
   through the comparison of the free fall of an apple on Earth and the
   orbit of the Moon around Earth. The questions were asked to KS4 pupils
   after the enacted sequence (experimental classes) and to KS4,
   undergraduate and pre-teachers after a classical lecture on dynamics
   (demonstration classes). Quantitative analysis of the answers reveals
   specific cognitive insight, especially for students reasoning about
   velocity and trajectories. The general purpose of this paper is thus to
   illustrate the use of the Human Orrery in the context of science
   education in the classroom and to make a first, preliminary
   demonstration of its efficiency.},

Abstract = {This article presents a qualitative descriptive-interpretive study about
   the abilities of pre-service primary science teachers (PPTs) to solve a
   measurement problem put to them as an activity of scientific inquiry.
   The participants in the study were 23 PPTs receiving training in science
   teaching, organized into small groups to solve the proposed problem. The
   data were collected through reports they prepared from a script with
   open-response questions that referred on the one hand to the planning,
   development and conclusions obtained with the scientific inquiry and on
   the other to promoting the PPTs' metacognitive reflection regarding the
   difficulties encountered, the lessons learned and their proposals for
   improvement for future activities on similar measurements. The
   information was analysed in three phases to increasingly refine the
   coding of this. The results revealed that, overall, the PPTs were able
   to complete the scientific inquiry with a fairly acceptable degree of
   efficacy. A discussion of the results emphasizes the usefulness of the
   procedural-type scientific inquiry activities to initiate PPTs in their
   approach to inquiry-based science education.},

Title = {An Analysis of Problem-Posing Tasks in Chinese and US Elementary

Abstract = {This paper reports on 2 studies that examine how mathematical problem
   posing is integrated in Chinese and US elementary mathematics textbooks.
   Study 1 involved a historical analysis of the problem-posing (PP) tasks
   in 3 editions of the most widely used elementary mathematics textbook
   series published by People's Education Press in China over 3 decades.
   Study 2 compared the PP tasks in Chinese and US elementary mathematics
   textbooks. This allows for the examination of PP tasks from an
   international comparative perspective, which provides one point of view
   about the kinds of learning opportunities that are available to students
   in China and the USA. We found evidence that the inclusion of PP tasks
   in the Chinese textbook series reflected, to some degree, changes in the
   curricular frameworks in China. However, the distribution of PP tasks
   across grade levels and content areas, as well as the variety of types
   of PP tasks included, suggest a need for greater intentionality in the
   design and placement of PP tasks in both the Chinese and US textbook
   series. Findings from the 2 studies reported in this paper not only
   contribute to our understanding about the inclusion of PP tasks in
   curriculum both historically and internationally, but also suggest a
   great need to systematically integrate PP activities into curriculum and
   instruction. The fact that both Chinese and US curriculum standards have
   heavily emphasized PP in school mathematics, despite there being only a
   small proportion of PP activities in both Chinese and US elementary
   mathematics curricula, suggests the existence of challenges that are
   delaying the implementation of reform ideas such as problem posing in
   school mathematics.},

Abstract = {The understanding of measurement is related to the understanding of the
   nature of science-one of the main goals of current international science
   teaching at all levels of education. This case study explores how a
   first-year university physics course deals with measurement
   uncertainties in the light of an epistemological analysis of
   measurement. The data consist of the course documents, interviews with
   senior instructors, and laboratory instructors' responses to an online
   questionnaire. During laboratory work, uncertainties are expressed in
   the large majority of the measurements made by the students but only in
   less than half of their calculation results. The instructors'
   expectations are that students systematically estimate uncertainties so
   that they become aware that measurements and calculations are never
   exact. However, since uncertainties are not specified for the values
   given in the laboratory guides, uncertainties are often missing from the
   results of students' calculations. The potential side effects of
   students' measurement understanding are discussed and suggestions for
   improvements are proposed.},

Abstract = {For pre-service teachers (PSTs) who have been exposed to traditional
   approaches, teacher education courses can be a revelatory experience in
   their development as educators. This study explores if Canadian upper
   elementary/lower secondary (grades 4-10) PSTs change their beliefs about
   mathematics teaching as a result of taking a mathematics methods course
   and how the course influenced these beliefs. Surveys were used to
   measure participants' mathematics beliefs, and results show that PSTs'
   beliefs moved to favor reform-based approaches. Qualitative data
   complemented the survey results, suggesting that experiencing new
   approaches and having the opportunity to apply them into practice are
   important to their development as mathematics teachers.},

Abstract = {In an undergraduate Calculus III class, we explore the effect of
   ``flipping{''} the instructional delivery of content on both student
   performance and student perceptions. Two instructors collaborated to
   determine daily lecture notes, assigned the same homework problems, and
   gave identical exams; however, compared to a more traditional
   instructional approach, the flipped instructor utilized videos to
   communicate more procedural course content to students out-of-class,
   with time in-class spent on more conceptual activities and homework
   problems. Findings from two semesters indicate similar performance on
   more procedural problems and small to moderate gains for the flipped
   students (N = 74) over their traditional counterparts (N = 77) on more
   conceptual exam problems. However, student perceptions remain mixed,
   with flipped students reporting increased communication during class but
   traditional students perceiving more effective use of class time,
   despite the gains in performance for flipped students.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the achievement goals orientation of first year
   physics students at a South African university. The mixed methods design
   involved a quantitative survey of 291 students using an achievement
   goals questionnaire and individual interviews of selected participants.
   Results showed that the students perceived they have a stronger mastery
   goals orientation than performance goals and performance avoidance goals
   orientations. Multiple regression analysis in testing the mastery goals
   model indicated that the participants' perceptions of teacher and peer
   goal emphases made the largest unique contribution to their orientation.
   It is suggested that at the tertiary level such an orientation should be
   promoted through learning experiences such as inquiry-based learning,
   which has been associated with this orientation.},

Abstract = {Before science can be completely understood, one of the fundamental
   skills that must be developed is observation. Improving descriptive
   writing and investigating students' observational skills in the
   classroom is the purpose of this study. The study was designed to
   determine if such skills, practiced through modeling activities, serve
   as a way to improve students' descriptive directional writing skills.
   Participating in this study were two groups of seventh (N = 12) and
   eighth graders (N = 12) at a middle school in the Midwest, USA. The
   students participating in the study each received a set of materials to
   construct an item (a 3D object) in an isolated area within the room for
   privacy. After constructing the item, the student was to write a set of
   directions on how to construct the item that they had made. A second
   student was then given the same set of materials along with the first
   student's instructions on how to construct it. This activity was
   repeated four times over a 4-week period. Results indicated that over
   time students made a significant improvement in their descriptive
   writing skills and observational skills. Implications of the findings
   are discussed in terms of the characteristics of middle school students'
   skills and knowledge of descriptive writing and observation.},

Abstract = {We compared the materialization of knowledge integration processes in
   class discussions that followed troubleshooting (TS) and problem-solving
   (PS) tasks and examined the impact of these tasks on students'
   conceptual understanding. The study was conducted in two sixth-grade
   classes taught by the same teacher, in six lessons that constituted a
   third of a unit on simple electric circuits. In these lessons, one class
   was assigned PS tasks where students were asked to solve conceptual
   problems. Later they were asked to share their work in a class
   discussion. The other class was assigned TS tasks where students were
   asked to identify, explain, and correct the mistakes in
   ``teacher-made{''} erroneous solutions to these same problems. They were
   also engaged later in a class discussion. We found that students'
   performance on subsequent transfer problems was significantly higher for
   the TS class, in particular for students with low prior knowledge. We
   account for the difference in learning outcomes by the differences in
   the learning process: the TS tasks elicited more na < ve ideas both in
   students' worksheets as well as in class discussions, and the TS
   discussions involved more episodes where students developed criteria to
   discern scientifically acceptable and naive ideas. We also found
   differences in the format of students' participation, where
   lower-achieving students participated in the TS discussions. The
   implications of these findings for future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {A scientifically literate person should be able to engage and critique
   science news reports about socioscientific issues from a variety of
   information sources. Such engagement involves critical thinking and
   argumentation skills to determine if claims made are justified by
   evidence and explained by reasonable explanations. This study explored
   university students' critical thinking performance when they read
   science news reports. Undergraduate science/applied science (n = 52) and
   non-science (n = 52) majors were asked to select a science news report
   from Internet sources and then to read, critique, and make comments
   about its contents. The science and non-science majors' comments and
   their quality were identified and assessed in terms of analyzing the
   argument elements-claims and warrants, counterclaims and warrants,
   rebuttals, qualifiers, and evidence. The results indicated there is
   significant difference in identifying and formulating evidence favoring
   science/applied science over non-science majors (p < .01). Quality of
   critical thinking associated with the strength of the arguments made
   indicated that science/applied science majors demonstrate significantly
   (p < 0.05) more advanced patterns than non-science majors. The results
   suggest that further studies into improving undergraduates' concepts of
   evidence in the context of reading and critiquing science news reports
   are needed.},

Abstract = {The Electrochemistry topic is found to be difficult to learn due to its
   abstract concepts involving macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic
   representation levels. Studies have shown that animation and simulation
   using information and communication technology (ICT) can help students
   to visualize and hence enhance their understanding in learning abstract
   chemistry topics. As a result, an interactive multimedia module with the
   pedagogical agent (IMMPA) named the EC Lab (Electrochemistry Lab) was
   developed in order to assist students in the learning of
   Electrochemistry topics. A non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group
   design investigation was carried out in order to gauge the effect of the
   IMMPA EC Lab on students' understanding and motivation in the learning
   of Electrochemistry. Some 127 Form Four students from two secondary
   schools in one of the districts in Malaysia were involved in the study.
   Each school had one treatment group and one control group taught by the
   same Chemistry teacher. Instruments involved were a pre- and posttest, a
   pre- and post-motivation questionnaire, and the IMMPA EC Lab. Results
   showed a significant difference between the control groups and treatment
   groups in the understanding of concepts in the learning of
   Electrochemistry.},

Abstract = {Recent research and reform documents in mathematics and science
   education have highlighted the importance of preservice teacher
   education that focuses on understanding students' reasoning and
   modifying instruction accordingly. Utilizing the constructs of core
   practices and the professional noticing as lenses with which to examine
   the development of preservice teachers' questioning practice, we
   conducted a case study of 1 pair of preservice teachers as they
   performed weekly formative assessment interviews to elicit student
   thinking during 1 semester. Our study was driven by the following
   research questions: (1) How do preservice teachers develop their
   questioning practice and ability to notice students' thinking about
   mathematical and science concepts? (2) How can these questioning
   practices be further developed? Results suggest that with weekly
   practice and reflection, preservice teachers can develop their
   questioning practice within the context of face-to-face interaction with
   students and that the ways they question students can change when given
   opportunities to interact with them and analyze their thinking. By
   having participants attend to what they were professionally noticing
   about students' thinking, we contend that they learned to adapt their
   questioning techniques to ask students more competent questions.
   Participants also exhibited 2 areas of questioning practice ripe for
   improvement-asking leading questions and missed opportunities to probe
   students' thinking. While providing clinical field experiences to
   preservice teachers is not novel, we suggest the importance of
   foregrounding practices that elicit student mathematical and scientific
   thinking through an iterative process of enactment and reflection to
   develop questioning practice and the ability to notice.},

Abstract = {Innovative programs for restructuring the entry phase of mathematics
   teacher education programs have been implemented at various German
   universities within the last few years. This article reports about the
   design and the results of a longitudinal evaluation study of the
   effectiveness of two of these programs aiming to improve mathematics
   teacher education by altering the conditions in university teaching (the
   so-called Teacher Education and Development Study TEDS-Telekom). The
   development of prospective teachers' professional knowledge in academic
   mathematical content knowledge, knowledge in elementary mathematics from
   an advanced standpoint, and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge
   from the innovative programs were compared to traditional university
   programs. The study points out that the innovative programs only
   partially succeeded in improving the acquisition of professional

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of
   argumentation-based pedagogy on college students' conceptual
   understanding of properties and behaviors of gases. The sample consists
   of 108 students (52 in the control group and 56 in the intervention
   group) drawn from 2 general chemistry college courses taught by the same
   instructor. Data were collected through pre- and post-tests. The results
   of the study show that the intervention group students performed
   significantly better than the control group students on the post-test.
   The intervention group students also showed significant increase in
   their test scores between pre- and post-test. While at least 80 \% of
   the students in the intervention group abandoned their initial ideas on
   all of the 17 alternative conceptions that were identified by the
   authors but one, the percent of student abandoning their initial ideas
   in the control group was less than 50. The discussion focuses on the
   implications of these results for addressing students' alternative
   conceptions, promoting the argumentation-pedagogy in college science
   courses and the challenges associated with the use of argumentation in
   college science classrooms.},

Abstract = {A 44-item survey instrument was designed to determine secondary
   students' views about how useful various specific actions related to
   reducing global warming might be, their willingness to undertake these
   various actions and the extent to which these 2 might be linked. The
   instrument was administered to students in grades 6 - 10 (n = 768) from
   4 large schools in metropolitan Delhi, India in which the teaching
   language was English. The findings indicated that this cohort of Indian
   students exhibited high levels of concern about climate change and
   strong willingness to act against global warming and in favour of the
   environment. The findings are tentatively compared with those from 2
   similar survey studies conducted in Western contexts (Spain and
   Australia).},

Title = {ENACTED TYPES OF ALGEBRAIC ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT CLASSES TAUGHT BY THE

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine how teachers enact the same written
   algebra curriculum materials in different classes. The study addresses
   this issue by comparing the types of algebraic activity (Kieran, 2004)
   enacted in two 7th grade classes taught by the same teacher, using the
   same textbook. Data sources include lesson observations and an interview
   with the teacher. The findings show that students in the two classes
   were offered somewhat different algebraic experiences. At one school,
   more emphasis was placed on global/meta-level activities (activities
   that are not exclusive to algebra and suggest general mathematical
   processes), whereas at the other school, more emphasis was placed on
   transformational activities ({''}rule-based{''} algebraic activities).
   Analysis of the sources of the differences related to the ways in which
   the teacher used and enacted the curriculum materials in the two classes
   revealed that these were linked to the teacher's attempts to be
   attentive to the students in the class and to the nature of the
   students' work.},

Abstract = {Intervention at scale with the aim of improving student participation,
   engagement and outcomes in mathematics education is a challenge for
   educational policy makers and reformers. This article argues that an
   iterative annual cycle of policy formulation, implementation and
   evaluation enabled ongoing adjustments to the strategic focus, the
   professional development model and the system infrastructure as the New
   Zealand Numeracy Development Project was taken to scale. The analysis
   draws on the project's evaluation data over a 6-year period to
   demonstrate how adjustments were made over time to the pedagogical tools
   and to the professional development processes. The ongoing development
   of knowledge supported the management of strategic risks in taking the
   project to scale: the ongoing appropriation of adequate levels of
   resourcing to support the school-based professional development model
   and the availability of system-wide expertise for effective
   implementation. The analysis suggests that conceptualising
   implementation as an interdependent and interrelated component of an
   iterative policy process and as an opportunity for knowledge building
   ensured a continuing focus on student outcomes. The dynamic approach to
   the policy process appeared central to building this intervention's
   effectiveness and feasibility at scale.},

Abstract = {This study describes the development and validation of a Greek-language
   instrument that can be used to assess grade 10 students' perceptions of
   their chemistry classroom environment as a means of showing differences
   between chemistry learning environments in Greece (Attica) and Cyprus.
   The development of the instrument was based on available learning
   environment questionnaires. The questionnaire was administered to 1,394
   students from 49 chemistry classes in Attica, and the resulting data
   were analyzed to explore the reliability and the validity of the new
   instrument. The validated questionnaire was administered to 225 students
   from 15 classes in urban areas of Cyprus. The data analyses supported
   the questionnaire's internal consistency, discriminant validity, and
   ability to differentiate between classrooms. Effect sizes and
   independent samples t test analyses revealed differences between the two
   samples. Cypriot students viewed their chemistry classroom environment
   more favorably than did the Attica students. A possible cause for this
   difference could be the knowledge-centered aspect of the grade 10
   chemistry curriculum in Greece compared to the corresponding
   tool-instrumental knowledge curriculum in Cyprus.},

Abstract = {This article presents the findings of an international collaborative
   investigation into preservice teachers' views on the nature of
   scientific knowledge development with respect to six elements:
   observations and inferences, tentativeness, scientific theories and
   laws, social and cultural embeddedness, creativity and imagination, and
   scientific methods. A total of 640 preservice teachers, 209 from the
   United States, 212 from China, and 219 from Turkey, participated in the
   study. The survey ``Student Understanding of Science and Scientific
   Inquiry (SUSSI){''}, having a blend of Likert-type items and related
   open-ended questions, was used to gain a fuller understanding of the
   preservice teachers' views of the nature of scientific knowledge
   development. Across the three countries, the participants demonstrated
   better understanding of the tentative NOS aspect but less understanding
   of the nature of and relationship between scientific theories and
   scientific laws. The Chinese sample scored highest on five of the six
   Likert sub-scales, the USA sample demonstrated more informed views on
   observation and inference, and the Turkish preservice teachers possessed
   relatively more traditional views in all six NOS aspects. Conclusions
   and limitations of the present study as well as implications and
   recommendations for future studies, are also discussed.},

Title = {THE POWER OF LEARNING GOAL ORIENTATION IN PREDICTING STUDENT MATHEMATICS

Abstract = {The teaching and learning of mathematics in schools has drawn tremendous
   attention since the education reform in Taiwan. In addition to assessing
   cognitive abilities, Taiwan Assessment of Student Achievement in
   Mathematics (TASA-MAT) collects background information to help depict
   average student achievement in schools in an educational context. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between
   student achievement in mathematics and student background
   characteristics. The data for this study was derived from the sample for
   the 2005 TASA-MAT Sixth-Grade Main Survey in Taiwan. The average age of
   the sixth-grade students in Taiwan is 11 years old, as was the sample
   for the 2005 TASA-MAT. Student socioeconomic status (SES) and student
   learning-goal orientation were specified as predictor variables of
   student performance in mathematics. The results indicate that the better
   performance in mathematics tended to be associated with a higher SES and
   stronger mastery goal orientation. The SES factor accounted for 4.98\%
   of the variance, and student learning-goal orientation accounted for an
   additional 10.61\% of the variance. The major implication obtained from
   this study was that goal orientation was much more significant than SES
   in predicting student performance in mathematics. In addition, the Rasch
   model treatment of the ordinal response-category data is a novel
   approach to scoring the goal-orientation items, with the corresponding
   results in this study being satisfactory.},

Abstract = {This study attempted to investigate the alternative conceptions that a
   group of 12 Lebanese students in a grade 9 class hold about electricity.
   It also attempted to evaluate learning outcomes of implementing in that
   class an inquiry-based module for the acquisition of conceptual
   understanding of basic concepts in electricity. Fourteen mostly
   subjective tests were administered throughout the implementation phase
   of the inquiry-based module to assess the evolution of participants'
   conceptions. The instrument DIRECT (Version 1.0) focusing on conceptual
   understanding was used as a post-instructional test to measure
   acquisition of understanding. The findings revealed that most of the
   alternative conceptions reported in literature were found amongst the
   participants. Results of the post-testing showed that the implemented
   inquiry-based approach was successful in enhancing participants'
   conceptual understanding of the targeted DC circuit concepts.},

Abstract = {Problem-solving is, by nature, a creative process which, by teaching
   through the implementation of research and discovery activities, allows
   students to create their knowledge, revise it and link it to broader
   systems. The aim of the research was to describe and analyse the process
   of solving biological problems through activities that are performed
   during the process of solving them, as well as to study how the
   implementation of these activities affects the level and quality of
   student achievement in biology. This study employed a quantitative
   method research strategy to describe the problem-solving process in
   biology teaching and determine student achievement. Data collection was
   by means of survey and testing. A Likert-scale survey and a biology
   knowledge test were constructed for the purposes of the research. For
   data analysis, descriptive statistics, factor analysis and the Pearson
   correlation coefficient were used. The data of eighth-grade students
   were collected from September 2016 to February 2017, in 72 schools in
   Serbia (565 students). The factor analysis confirmed that
   problem-solving activities could be grouped into the following five
   areas: (1) analysing and planning problem-solving; (2) discovering
   solution(s) to the problem; (3) problem-solving evaluation activities;
   (4) additional activities involving the discussion of the problem; (5)
   the degree of student independence in the process of discovering a
   solution to a problem. The results show that with the increasing
   frequency of the realisation of the research problem-solving activities,
   the achievement of students also increases. With regard to achievement
   quality, a positive but low correlation was found in all three
   domains-knowledge acquisition, understanding and application.},

Title = {Integrating Science and Mathematics in Elementary School: Impact on
   Selected Student Perceptual Variables},

Abstract = {Integrating science and mathematics in the elementary classroom is a
   significant challenge, as evidenced by the few convincing examples
   currently available in the scholarly literature. Yet, this integration
   is often seen as presenting epistemological and pedagogical value. This
   study aims to measure the impact of science and mathematics (S \& M)
   learning situations on certain perceptual variables, namely,
   self-efficacy (SE), interest, and perceived S \& M links, by comparing
   three experimental conditions: (0) control, (1) science, and (2)
   integration of S \& M. Multilevel linear regressions using data from the
   Science and Mathematics Integration Questionnaire (SMIQ) suggest that
   making mathematics explicit in science learning situations (2) or
   keeping mathematics instruction implicit (1) significantly increases SE
   in science and SE in mathematics compared to the control condition (0).
   Further analysis suggests that there were significant a posteriori
   differences between conditions in students' ability to perceive the
   links between science and mathematics, with the highest score being for
   S \& M and the lowest for control.},

Abstract = {It is difficult for mathematics teachers to find and utilize relevant
   historical content for their students. In this study, we aimed to
   examine how prospective mathematics teachers (PMTs) evaluate the history
   of mathematics (HM) in curriculum resources and how they integrate the
   HM into lesson plans. We collected data through PMTs' evaluation reports
   on the analysis of textbooks, lesson plans, and lesson plan reflections.
   PMTs evaluated textbooks critically, acknowledging the limits and
   recognizing the possibilities. They mostly provided negative evaluations
   and criticized the quality of HM in the textbooks. The findings revealed
   that PMTs' evaluations of the analysis of HMs in textbooks served as a
   bridge to assist their utilization of HMs in lesson plans. When PMTs
   incorporated HM into their lesson plans in an effort to engage students
   in the learning of mathematics, the HM integration reached higher levels
   of cognitive demand. However, they performed less well when
   incorporating pedagogical instructions and student thinking. The
   theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.},

Abstract = {Integrated STEM education has been the focus of recent curriculum
   reforms worldwide. Learning through design is a distinctive and
   significant approach to achieving STEM integration. Although studies
   have investigated various outcomes of design-based STEM learning, little
   has been done to examine its influence on two significant learning
   outcomes-STEM creativity and epistemic beliefs, especially in the
   context of primary education. In this study, we investigated the effects
   of a 6-month design-based STEM learning event (in which the application
   of information technologies was required) on 155 upper primary students'
   STEM creativity and epistemic beliefs. The results showed (i) a
   significant improvement in the fluency and flexibility dimensions of
   STEM creativity, (ii) a significant decrease in the source, certainty,
   and justification dimensions of epistemic beliefs, and (iii) no
   statistically significant change in the originality dimension of STEM
   creativity or the complexity dimension of epistemic beliefs. Moreover,
   we found significant and negative correlations between STEM creativity
   and the source, certainty, and justification dimensions of epistemic
   beliefs, but a significant and positive correlation between STEM
   creativity and the complexity dimension of epistemic beliefs. The
   findings of this study generate additional evidence to support
   design-based learning as a meaningful and feasible approach to achieving
   STEM integration in primary schools. Suggestions are made on how to
   design and implement integrated STEM education in primary schools.},

Abstract = {As part of an on-going effort to increase recruitment and retention of
   historically marginalized groups in science, technology, engineering,
   and mathematics (STEM) programs and careers, this study examines student
   perceptions of a culturally relevant undergraduate STEM degree program
   designed to prepare Indigenous students for graduate school and
   scientific careers within their communities. We describe an
   undergraduate fisheries STEM program, which offers place-based
   curriculum with traditional ecological knowledge, research
   opportunities, and intergenerational mentoring, within the context of
   aquatic-science and fisheries education at a private minority-serving
   institution in the USA. In-depth semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with North American Indigenous participants about their
   experiences and perceptions of the program with respect to their
   interest and perseverance in STEM and how relationships, such as
   intergenerational mentoring, supported their academic pursuits. Informed
   by sociocultural perspectives on science education, key findings
   indicated that students placed a high value on the incorporation of
   Indigenous knowledge and place-based learning in coursework, research
   experiences with culturally significant subjects, and relationships with
   mentors as instrumental to achieve their goals. Students claimed these
   experiences provided them opportunities to develop important scientific
   skills; offered socio-emotional, cultural, and spiritual support; and
   encouraged them to persist in their educational pathways to serve their
   communities and future generations through STEM. This study provides
   insight into how students perceive community-informed design and
   implementation of undergraduate STEM curriculum and can thus support
   Indigenous students in achieving community-oriented STEM goals.},

Abstract = {Expectancy-value theory of achievement motivation has attracted the
   interest of many researchers over the last four decades. However, little
   research has discussed the situative and culturally focused aspects of
   this theory. The present study aims to validate a Chinese version of the
   expectancy value scale (EVS) and compare mathematics achievement
   motivation between Dai and Han ethnic groups to illustrate the influence
   of cultural background on students' developing expectancy and task
   value. Seven hundred ninety-seven Dai and Han secondary school students
   from Xishuangbanna, China, participated in this study. Confirmatory
   factor analyses and multigroup analyses were used to examine the
   validity of the EVS and measurement invariance across Dai and Han
   groups, respectively. Results indicated that the EVS possessed
   sufficient psychometric properties and measurement invariance across Dai
   and Han groups. Besides, there was no significant difference in
   mathematics expectancy between these two groups, while the task values
   of Dai students were significantly lower than those of Han students.
   Possible cultural explanations for the results and the implications for
   school practitioners are discussed.},

Abstract = {Raising scientifically literate citizens has been the main concern of
   the science education community. Socioscientific issues (SSIs) provide a
   context to facilitate individuals to expand their epistemic
   understanding and develop scientific reasoning skills such as
   evidence-based argumentation and consensus building. In this qualitative
   research, we examined how preservice middle school science teachers
   (PSTs) embedded the nature of science (NOS) aspects via physical dynamic
   models (PDM) that they developed on SSIs. We specifically focused on how
   PSTs scientifically explained the SSIs in their PDMs by explicitly
   incorporating and reflecting on the NOS aspects. Slightly more than half
   of the groups succeeded in developing models with dynamic/functional
   feature that enabled their classmates to predict, hypothesize, test,
   observe, infer, and generate an explanation of the SSI during
   presentations. Almost half of the PSTs could not differentiate between
   demonstration and functional/dynamic models. We additionally used the
   VNOS-C questionnaire to assess PSTs' NOS understanding at the beginning
   and end of the semester. The VNOS-C results showed that PSTs improved on
   all NOS aspects at the end of the semester. However, among seven NOS
   aspects that we focused on in our study, creativity and imagination,
   empirical evidence, and inferential reasoning were explicitly used in
   PSTs' presentations of SSI using PDMs. Their presentations did not
   address subjectivity, tentativeness, social and cultural influence, and
   theory and law aspects. We recommend replicating this study in different
   science contexts. Integrating NOS aspects into physical dynamic models
   needs to be further investigated.},

Abstract = {Multiple studies have been conducted regarding teachers' error-handling
   practices, and how errors can be treated as opportunities for learning,
   albeit in the context of whole-class discussions. The aim of the present
   research is to continue to investigate teachers' error-handling
   practices as they occur in different phases of maths lessons:
   introduction of the task, when students are working alone, and when
   students are working in pairs and finally, as part of the whole-class
   discussion. The study included 51 lessons from twelve teachers. A
   cross-case analysis was made across the individual teacher cases to look
   for similarities and differences between different teachers'
   error-handling practices across the lesson phases in order to create
   teaching profiles with similar handling of student errors across the
   lesson phases. Five error-handling teaching profiles were identified;
   correcting errors throughout all phases, correcting errors during
   students' work while few errors are brought up in whole class,
   correcting errors during students' work while using a variety of
   practices in whole class, ignoring errors while using some of them in
   whole class, and discussing and explaining errors.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the characteristics of high-quality mathematics
   teaching in China following the launch of a new standard curriculum.
   Data was gathered through video-recorded observations of lessons that
   won a national teaching contest. We identified and examined the
   characteristics of the instructional practices through six domains: (1)
   the mathematics, (2) cognitive demand, (3) classroom management (4)
   equitable access to mathematical content, (5) agency, authority, and
   identity, and (6) formative assessment. The results indicated that a
   well-managed classroom and low level of formative assessment were
   salient features of the observed lessons. In most cases, though students
   had a chance to say or explain things, their ideas were not explored or
   built upon. The majority of the mathematics task designs offered
   possibilities for ``student struggle,{''} but teaching practices tended
   to ``scaffold away{''} the challenges, which reduced cognitive demand
   for students. Good mathematics instructional practices are nested in
   underlying social and cultural values and norms. Implications for
   practice and future research are presented.},

Abstract = {Growing research evidence indicates student learning gains from guided
   representation construction/invention in school science and mathematics.
   In this inquiry approach, students address challenges around what
   features of a phenomenon/problem to attend to, what data to collect, how
   and why, and make collective judgments about multimodal accounts of
   phenomena. However, researchers to date have tended to focus on student
   learning rather than on the teacher's role in guiding various phases of
   inquiry. In this paper we report on (a) analysis of Grade 1 students'
   engagement in interdisciplinary mathematics and science inquiry
   practices in a classroom sequence in ecology; (b) the teacher's role in
   guiding such inquiry; and (c) interpretation of these practices in terms
   of support of student transduction (connecting and remaking meanings
   across representations in different modes). Data from our study included
   video capture of two case study teachers' guidance of tasks and
   classroom discussion and student artefacts. We examine the classroom
   processes through which the teachers used students' invention and
   revision of data displays to teach the concepts of living things,
   diversity, distribution and adaptive features related to habitat in
   science. Mathematical processes included constructing and interpreting
   mapping, measurement and data modelling, sampling and using a scale. The
   analysis offers fresh insights into how teachers support student
   learning in these two subjects, through discrete stages of orienting,
   representation challenge, building consensus and applying and extending
   representational systems.},

Abstract = {Engaging and retaining undergraduate students in science, technology,
   engineering, and math (STEM) fields is essential for the future
   workforce in the USA. Building off a growing body of research which
   explores how intelligence beliefs impact psychosocial variables of STEM
   engagement (e.g. STEM self-efficacy, sense of belonging), the current
   research included 523 undergraduate STEM majors. Participants answered a
   series of questions about their self-intelligence beliefs and perceived
   intelligence beliefs of their professors. Findings from a series of
   mediation analyses showed that participants' perception of their
   professors' incremental beliefs predicted variables associated with STEM
   engagement and retention (STEM interest, STEM self-efficacy, sense of
   belonging in STEM, and grit) through participants' self-incremental
   beliefs. These findings highlight the important roles that academic
   environments (e.g. perceived intelligence beliefs of one's professors)
   and one's intelligence beliefs play in STEM engagement. Future
   directions and implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on research which explored the mathematics teaching
   efficacy beliefs of preservice primary teachers, where efficacy beliefs
   describe individuals' beliefs in their potential to enact teaching to
   promote learning. Efficacy was conceptualised as a bi-faceted construct
   consisting of personal efficacy and outcome expectancy. This research
   sought to establish the extent to which differences in efficacy are
   explained by students' mathematics attainment level prior to entry into
   teacher education; the educational level of the students (whether
   postgraduate or undergraduate); students' sense of preparedness to teach
   mathematics on school placement; and students' gender. A total of 186
   students responded to a questionnaire designed to measure their efficacy
   beliefs after completing one taught mathematics education module in
   university and one teaching practice placement in primary schools.
   Bivariate and regression analysis pointed to complex relationships
   between the explanatory and outcome variables. On bivariate analysis,
   findings included statistically significant associations between gender,
   mathematics attainment, preparedness to teach, and one or both of
   personal efficacy and outcome expectancy. In the regression analysis,
   gender was statistically significantly associated with outcome
   expectancy, while preparedness to teach and mathematics attainment were
   statistically significantly correlated with personal efficacy. Personal
   efficacy and outcome expectancy were significantly correlated on
   bivariate analysis, but significance was not retained after controlling
   for other factors in the regression models. This research has
   implications for teacher educators in understanding factors explaining
   mathematics teaching efficacy and therefore helping to better prepare
   preservice teachers to teach mathematics in the primary school
   classroom.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify and categorize in-the-moment
   teaching moves which support productive general social norms and
   sociomathematical norms during dialogic instruction by drawing on
   transcripts of classroom episodes. To understand how teachers construct
   in-the-moment teaching moves, this paper is grounded in a revised
   version of the Advancing Children's Thinking framework. In particular,
   the framework reveals three interconnected dimensions of teaching moves:
   (1) eliciting group strategies, (2) supporting conceptual understanding
   and group coordination, and (3) extending group mathematical thinking
   and coordination. Drawing on this framework, we use a novel self-study
   methodology to construct a sequence of in-the-moment teaching moves that
   support the development of productive social and sociomathematical norms
   in dialogic classrooms. These teaching moves include (1) inviting
   strategies and encouraging all members to actively listen; (2)
   exploring, clarifying, and questioning the mathematical details of all
   strategies as a group; (3) promoting understanding of differing
   strategies; (4) comparing and evaluating differing strategies as a
   group; and (5) connecting the group's thinking for making progress on
   the task/advancing current strategy to become viable. Implications for
   research and practice are offered.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the perspectives of primary school
   teachers in South Africa, who participated in a Lesson Study (LS)
   project, on this professional development process and about their
   professional learning. The study followed a mixed approach, with data
   collected through a questionnaire, followed up by interviews. A novel
   approach in this study was to source teachers' experiences of the
   individual stages of LS as well as of the integrated process. Teachers'
   perspectives on LS were categorised into 5 themes: collaboration -
   commitment and the free rider effect, confidence issues, teachers'
   knowledge and skills, misconceptions about the LS approach, and external
   issues including concerns over time of teachers and learners, systemic
   challenges and school management. Using teachers' individual and focus
   group inputs in the questionnaire and the interviews, we report about
   their experiences.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate how languages in a
   multilingual classroom come to participate in the objectification
   process in the context of pattern generalization. Data came from the
   transcription of 10 videotaped sessions in grade 7. A mixed
   quantitative-qualitative approach was adopted for the analysis. The
   significance of triadic dialog (teacher initiation - student response -
   teacher feedback) (Sinclair \& Coulthard, 1975) as the dominant mode of
   interaction and the multilingual nature of language were presented as
   unique aspects of classroom talk in this study. The multilingual
   classroom (teacher and students) repertoire, which includes aspects of
   colloquial Arabic and English, was a resource of meaning-making for
   objectification in different generalization level episodes during
   classroom talk. Crucial words in home language played various roles in
   the process of objectification. The teacher and students used colloquial
   Arabic to refer to deictic means, adverbs of generative action, and
   pronouns in addition to other linguistic functions. Those linguistic
   means prove to be central to the process of objectification. The study
   analyzes three episodes. The first two episodes present how the teacher
   and students used code-switching and colloquial Arabic for various
   functions in almost all utterances to objectify near generalization
   tasks. The third episode focuses on how languages come to participate in
   the objectification process in a far generalization task. The findings
   show that natural movements between languages helped in the
   objectification process of generalization. The findings also show that
   the relational, diverse, stratified, and agentive aspects of languages
   helped in the objectification process during various generalization
   level episodes.},

Abstract = {Dealing with student errors is a central feature of instructional
   quality. Teachers' reactions to a student's error and classmates' errors
   can be crucial to the success of a lesson. A teacher should respond
   appropriately in terms of motivational and learning-related issues so
   that the error can become a learning opportunity for students.
   Currently, error situations have rarely been directly recorded and
   explored in empirical zstudies. This gap is the central focus of the
   current study in which we investigated errors in biology instruction
   within a cross-sectional design where biology lessons in German
   secondary schools were videotaped, teachers' dealings with errors
   analyzed, and student achievement documented with pretests and
   posttests. The study found that constructively dealing with student
   errors had a significant positive effect on student achievement at the
   class level. Results confirmed the relevance of teachers' appropriate
   dealing with student errors on learning in biology instruction.},

Abstract = {Despite the centrality of math teacher educators (MTEs) in teacher
   education, we know little about the nature of professional learning
   opportunities for MTEs to develop and enhance the knowledge needed to
   teach prospective teachers. Existing models for supporting MTEs in
   developing their knowledge and practice do not address how to prepare
   novice MTEs in initially learning to teach prospective teachers. We
   present a professional learning model we have been pursuing for
   supporting novice MTEs and the generation of and role for community
   artifacts, namely lesson plans, in that model. We outline the process by
   which we implement, analyze, and collectively revise lesson plans so
   that they are continually improved over time to serve as artifacts that
   better instantiate what members of the local community are learning
   about how to support novice MTEs through identification of their
   problems of practice. Finally, we problematize the model we are
   investigating and propose implications of this model and questions
   raised by our work with the goal of inviting further discussion about
   supporting novice MTEs.},

Abstract = {Positioned in the Hong Kong education context, this article evaluates
   the effects of teaching science through home and second languages (i.e.
   Chinese and English) in Secondary 2 (or eighth grade) science
   classrooms. A total of 479 students, divided into two language
   instruction groups, participated in a teaching intervention comprising
   16 lessons on the topic of `Making Use of Electricity'. Informed by the
   results of a mixed-methods study with a quasi-experimental design, with
   data collected from science diagnostic tests, inquiry questions and
   focus group interviews, this article reports that Chinese is the most
   advantageous language of instruction for low- and middle-ability science
   students, whereas English is more favourable for their high-achieving
   peers. Whilst Hong Kong students who learnt the focal topic in English
   were able to rid themselves of certain naive ideas generated from the
   translation of science terms into Chinese (e.g. pencil is translated as
   `lead pen' in Chinese), they were also found to have misconceptions
   about certain scientific concepts. For example, they were confused about
   `open' and `closed' circuits because they mixed up the words `open'
   ('(sic)') and `switch on' in English. The study's broad implications for
   language support and a mixed-code approach in science teaching worldwide
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {The intended curriculum is arguably one of the most important components
   within any national educational system although those in primary science
   have not been subject to extensive research scrutiny. Based on reformed
   primary science curricula from Hong Kong, mainland China, and Taiwan, we
   compared them on two key features: (1) levels of knowledge and cognitive
   processes from their learning outcomes, and (2) coherency of topics that
   influence the ease, meaningfulness, and quality of learning in the
   subject. In the former, we coded their intellectual demands (i.e., what
   learners must know and do) using revised Bloom's taxonomy while for the
   latter, we investigated the coverage, focus, sequence, and emphasis of
   topics across grades. We found that curricula from Hong Kong and
   mainland China generally focused on the first two levels of knowledge
   domains and cognitive processes while Taiwanese learning outcomes were
   predominantly coded as Apply. Different aspects of coherency in the
   intended curriculum revealed which topics were covered, their focus, and
   sequencing across grade divisions as well as their emphasis of topics.
   Our empirical research therefore adds to the small number of comparative
   studies in primary science curricula. It can also practically assist
   policy- and curriculum-making in these regions as they seek to
   understand and develop quality curricula in primary science.},

Abstract = {In this article, we assume that discursive language aspects of science
   education are highly intertwined with students' knowledge-building and
   meaning-making in science. In an empirical case study, we investigate
   secondary students' (ages 15 to 16) discursive language use during group
   interactions. The focus is on how students define and explain the
   content within everyday or scientific discourses and how their
   negotiations may influence discussion outcomes. The results suggest that
   students who can move between everyday and scientific languages benefit
   from this exchange, while students who only use colloquial language or
   relate the content to everyday experiences become disadvantaged.
   Furthermore, important general success factors are students' abilities
   to establish solid relationships between words, expressions, and
   scientific terms to discuss, explain, and evaluate the scientific
   content. The results show important differences in discursive use of
   language within various school environments.},

Abstract = {Decisions related to career choice are influenced by person's
   interactions with his or her environment. The purpose of this study was
   to examine the characteristics of a STEM (Science-Technology,
   Engineering, and Mathematics) career choice. The study included two
   stages in which two different questionnaires were used. The purpose of
   the first questionnaire, which was replied by 1162 people, was to
   examine their attitudes towards STEM, and their sense of employment
   capability in this field. The data were analyzed according to three age
   groups: 12th graders, young adults aged 21-35, and adults over the age
   of 35. The second stage focused on three sub-groups: young high school
   graduates with a high affinity to STEM studies, whom have not yet chosen
   career; adults who have chosen career as researchers in the STEM field;
   and adults who have chosen career as researchers in the social sciences
   and humanities. The second questionnaire examined environmental
   characteristics and attitudes towards the factors potentially
   influencing a career choice in STEM. The results indicate that the
   attitudes towards STEM and the sense of employment capability in this
   field become significantly more positive with age. The number of family
   members who have a STEM career was not found to be a significant factor
   influencing a career choice; however, a significant correlation was
   found between high school major and the career chosen by graduates. The
   research findings point to important trends that shed light on the
   process of choosing a career in STEM and concludes that young people's
   interest in science during school is a key variable to sparking interest
   in science careers.},

Title = {Teachers' Attitudes Toward Teaching Integrated STEM: the Impact of
   Personal Background Characteristics and School Context},

Abstract = {A promising approach to increase students' motivation for science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is integrated STEM
   education (iSTEM). This is an instructional approach that emphasizes the
   deeper connections between the STEM disciplines by involving students in
   design challenges centered around real-world problems. However, the
   successful implementation of a new instructional approach, such as
   iSTEM, strongly depends on teachers' attitudes toward the innovation.
   Therefore, a deeper understanding of teachers' attitudes toward teaching
   iSTEM is necessary. This study uses a survey method to investigate the
   influence of teachers' background characteristics and school context
   variables on teachers' attitudes toward teaching iSTEM. To do so, a
   differential approach is used. Attitudes toward five key principles for
   iSTEM (integration, problem-centered, inquiry-based, design-based, and
   cooperative learning) are examined separately to get a more in-depth and
   nuanced insight into the factors influencing these attitudes. Results of
   the multiple regression analyses show that participation in professional
   development is positively linked to teachers' attitudes toward all key
   principles, whereas several other teacher and school context variables
   are positively correlated with attitudes toward one or two principles.
   Moreover, experience in mathematics and total years of teaching show a
   negative correlation with several aspects of teachers' attitudes toward
   teaching iSTEM. Findings of this study are valuable, since they not only
   provide insight into possible barriers to the implementation of iSTEM
   but also suggest opportunities for overcoming these barriers.},

Abstract = {Recent research in science education for learners whose first language
   is Arabic suggests that learning in the mother tongue can reduce learner
   misconceptions, but there has been little research into the
   comprehensibility of science texts where Arabic is the language of
   instruction. This mixed-methods study describes the perceptions of
   substantial changes in science education, including translation of
   American science textbooks into Arabic, expressed by six grade 10
   physics teachers and 360 grade 10 physics learners in two cities in
   Saudi Arabia. Factor analysis allowed themes emerging from the teacher
   interviews to be compared with underlying constructs from student
   questionnaire responses. Results reveal teachers' and students' concerns
   about adequacy of resourcing for the newly mandated student-centered
   style of learning, and language difficulties affecting comprehensibility
   of the textbook to support students' learning. These findings suggest
   that science education policymakers should consider all components of
   constructive alignment if they wish to achieve the goals of science
   education reform that they set for themselves.},

Abstract = {This paper outlines an initial learning progression for the use of
   evidence to support scientific arguments in the context of
   decision-making. Use of evidence is a central feature of knowledge
   evaluation and, therefore, of argumentation. The proposal is based on
   the literature on argumentation and use of evidence in decision-making
   contexts. The objective is to develop a construct map describing a
   trajectory of evidence use in a decision-making context. The levels in
   the initial learning progression are characterised by students'
   performance in practice. The framework is applied to a multiple-case
   study in 10th grade (66 students), structured around a marine resource
   management task. Data included audio and video recordings, as well as
   students' written artefacts. Five levels of complexity in student
   performance are described; on the lowest level, students are able to
   identify and extract information in response to a problem and recognise
   general features in a set of data; on the uppermost level, they are able
   to articulate arguments by synthesising evidence from multiple sources
   and evaluate options based on evidence and scientific content. The
   framework also shows potential for recognising students' difficulties in
   identifying and integrating data and evidence in their justifications
   and in drawing from domain knowledge to interpret evidence. Implications
   for educational practice are discussed.},

   information about and gain greater insight into how student processes
   connections. Pre-calculus students were observed and interviewed while
   performing a task that required connections among graphical and
   algebraic representations of a polynomial relation. Their reasoning and
   processes on the task were examined. This revealed more detailed
   information about the nature of their connections and misconceptions.
   The study reveals different types of student connections among graphical

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to describe a design and implementation of a
   school-university action research project about teaching and learning
   biology and mathematics in primary school. Nine teachers in grades 1 to
   6, in collaboration with two researchers, were using content
   representation (CoRe) in learning study (LS)-inspired cycle as
   pedagogical tools when planning, implementing, and reflecting on lessons
   and pupil learning. By using pre- and post-tests, the teachers acquired
   knowledge about pupil subject-specific knowledge and learning. Some
   examples are given on how the tools in the project influenced the
   teaching practices and pupil learning. This research design brought
   together university and school practitioners to work collaboratively in
   a professional learning community, which developed teaching and learning
   in biology and mathematics.},

Abstract = {Based on the literature review about abacus arithmetic, this study
   proposes a model of the cognitive process of Chinese abacus arithmetic.
   This model describes three methods for solving abacus arithmetic
   problems: retrieval method, procedure method, and mental arithmetic
   method and three external factors that affect the choice of those
   methods: level of expertise, level of difficulty, and type of operation.
   The experiment in the study invited 36 participants including 12
   vocational high-school students as junior experts, 12 ordinary
   high-school students as novices, and 12 bank clerks as senior experts to
   validate the 3 x 3 x 2 experiment. The results of this study indicate
   that (1) the retrieval method, procedure method, and mental arithmetic
   method are the three main calculation methods of abacus arithmetic, each
   of them having some variations; (2) experts tend to use the retrieval
   method, while novices tend to use the mental arithmetic method; (3) the
   retrieval method and mental arithmetic method are applied more for
   simple operations and addition problems, while the procedure method is
   applied more for complicated operations and subtraction problems.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of an intervention
   on pre-service science teachers' self-efficacy to teach science through
   argumentation and explore the challenges they experienced while
   implementing argumentation. Forty pre-service science teachers in their
   final semester of schooling participated in an intervention that lasted
   for 11 weeks. Intervention focused on participants' understanding of
   argumentation as a scientific practice and as a pedagogical tool. The
   participants engaged in argument construction, evaluation, and critique,
   taught three argumentation lessons, engaged in peer observation of
   teaching, and reflection on their teaching skills. Data were collected
   through Argumentation Self-Efficacy Scale and an open-ended
   questionnaire. The results show that the intervention had a
   significantly positive effect on pre-service teachers' self-efficacy.
   Despite this reported self-efficacy, participants experienced
   significant challenges in guiding their students to construct scientific
   arguments and assessing the arguments developed by their students.
   Discussion focuses on implications for professional development of
   pre-service and in-service science teachers.},

Abstract = {From a multicultural perspective, this research investigated to what
   extent Korean mathematics textbooks use history of mathematics. The
   results show even though educational use of history presented in Korean
   mathematics textbooks may provide a rich outlook, it does not encourage
   a fundamental change in the educational practice of school mathematics
   that has traditionally been entrenched in the Eurocentric narrative of
   mathematics. This suggests that the mathematics textbooks were not
   organized effectively to promote students' understanding of diversity.
   Based on the results, we discuss the implications for the development of
   mathematics textbook from multicultural perspectives.},

Abstract = {Mathematics-related affect is established regarding both individual and
   interindividual levels. However, the interaction between the levels has
   not been elaborated. Furthermore, it is known that people may draw
   either from intrinsic or extrinsic experiences to construct their
   identities depending on their cultural environment. Thus, affective
   individual and interindividual levels seem to interact with culture. In
   this study we focus on the significance of and the interaction between
   the individual and the interindividual levels of affect. This is done
   with respect to 2 different types of countries (Finland and Chile) to
   include cultural effect. We use questionnaire-based data and pupils'
   drawings of their mathematics class to find out about their individual
   and interindividual experiences. By using mixed data, we are not only
   getting a wider picture of pupils' affect but we can also avoid the most
   typical errors made in the cross-cultural comparisons as the pupils' own
   voice is strengthened. The main finding in the study is that the 2
   affective levels are not congruent and that the incongruence appears
   differently in different types of cultures.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to propose and validate a structural model in
   fraction and decimal number addition, which is founded primarily on a
   synthesis of major theoretical approaches in the field of
   representations in Mathematics and also on previous research on the
   learning of fractions and decimals. The study was conducted among 1701
   primary and secondary school students. Eight components, which all
   involve representational transformations, were encompassed under the
   construct of representational flexibility in fraction and decimal number
   addition. This structure reveals that for both concepts, the
   representational transformation competences of recognition and
   conversion, and therefore representational flexibility as well, were
   affected by the complexity of the concepts involved and the direction of
   the conversion, respectively. Results also showed that two first-order
   factors were needed to explain the problem-solving ability in fraction
   and decimal number addition, indicating the differential effect of the
   modes of representation that is diagrammatic and verbal form on
   problem-solving ability irrespective of the concepts involved, as in the
   case of the conversions, Representational flexibility and
   problem-solving ability were found to be major components of students'
   representational thinking of fraction and decimal number addition, The
   proposed framework was invariant across the primary and secondary school
   students. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {A significant body of research literature in mathematics education
   attends to mathematical proofs. However, scant research attends to proof
   comprehension, which is the focus of this study. We examine perspective
   secondary teachers' conceptions of what constitutes comprehension of a
   given proof and their ideas of how students' comprehension can be
   evaluated. These are explored using a relatively novel approach,
   scripted dialogues. The analysis utilizes and expands the proof
   comprehension framework of Mejia-Ramos, Fuller, Weber, Rhoads \& Samkoff
   (Educational Studies in Mathematics, 79, 3-18, 2012). We suggest that
   this expansion is applicable to other studies on proof comprehension.},

Title = {Examination of the Nonlinear Dynamic Systems Associated with Science
   Student Cognition While Engaging in Science Information Processing},

Abstract = {A critical problem with the examination of learning in education is that
   there is an underlying assumption that the dynamic systems associated
   with student information processing can be measured using static linear
   assessments. This static linear approach does not provide sufficient
   ability to characterize learning. Much of the modern research within
   fields adjacent to education has embraced the idea that information
   processing and cognitive states are dramatically dynamic and nonlinear.
   The dynamic and nonlinear aspects of information processing makes
   current educational research methods ill equipped to examine cognitive
   processing. This is because many quantitative and qualitative methods of
   examination tacitly assume that ``snap-shots{''} provide an appropriate
   view of student information processing during learning. This study
   examines the role of nonlinear dynamics as a descriptor of student
   learning in the science classroom. The purpose of this study is to
   establish explanatory mechanisms for understanding the variable outputs
   seen within student cognitive processing of science-based tasks. Initial
   parameterization of the subject response to the task sets presented in a
   serious educational game occurred using the DINA-N model. Drawing upon
   the tools from other disciplines such as computational modeling and
   artificial neural networks, it is possible for science education
   researchers to understand the interplay of multiple processing units
   known as a cognitive attributes. At this point, a limitation of this
   approach in education is the accuracy and lack of the model's ability to
   represent the fractal dimensionality, emergent properties associated
   with cognition, and aspects of multiple interaction systems of the
   brain.},

Abstract = {Mathematics-related beliefs play an important role in the willingness to
   engage in academic activities in mathematics education. Such beliefs
   might not be consistent with the beliefs students hold about context
   problems that require sufficient mathematical knowledge and the
   application of such knowledge to various real-life situations. This
   study was designed to examine the differences between students'
   mathematics-related beliefs and beliefs about context problems. The
   variations in these beliefs could explain the different amounts of
   effort students put into solving context problems on one hand and in
   solving typical mathematical tasks on the other. The study included 261
   first-year students: students in one group were enrolled in academically
   more demanding study programmes (n = 162), while students in the other
   group (n = 99) were enrolled in less demanding study programmes. The
   results revealed significant differences in beliefs between the two
   groups. A detailed analysis indicates the factors which need to be
   emphasised when designing problem-based mathematics education to promote
   the successful problem solving of context problems.},

Abstract = {This study explored the quality of arguments used by first-year
   engineering university students enrolled in a traditional physics course
   dealing with electromagnetic induction and related problem solving where
   they had to assess whether the electromagnetic induction phenomenon
   would occur. Their conclusions were analyzed for the relevance of the
   laws and principles they had considered when coming to a conclusion
   (conceptual relevance) and the quality of the evidence and whether their
   conclusions were validated by the consistency of their reasoning
   (sufficiency of the reasoning). The most remarkable findings revealed
   emerging deficiencies linked to the fact that, when considering the
   evidence, in most cases, students do not reason the relationship between
   the evidence and the conclusion properly and they used only the Faraday
   Law. Implications for teaching, based on the results of this study,
   suggest that instruction should consider both the Faraday's and Lorentz
   Force Laws when trying to calculate the magnetic flow variation through
   the area swept by the conductor. Furthermore, considerations should
   explore both laws as equivalent and the need to develop a reasoned
   justification for their conclusions using the appropriate foundation.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the analysis of two teaching experiments carried out
   in the context of the mathematics laboratory in a primary school (grades
   3 and 4) with the use of the pascaline Zero + 1, an arithmetical
   machine. The teaching experiments are analysed by coordinating two
   theoretical frameworks, i.e. the instrumental approach and the Theory of
   Semiotic Mediation. The paper focuses on the analysis of the semiotic
   potential of the pascaline and students' instrumental genesis, on the
   functions of schemes and gestures of usage.},

Abstract = {This study presents a small part of a larger study investigating Turkish
   and German mathematics teachers' and their students' values (Values in
   Mathematics Teaching in Turkey and Germany). The main focus of the study
   was school levels of the teachers working at primary and secondary
   schools. The interactions related to nationality were also of interest.
   The methodology employed in this paper was a descriptive study. The
   participants were 27 German and 33 Turkish teachers. A five-point
   Likert-type questionnaire was used as data collection instrument. The
   data were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics for
   analysis. Effect size coefficients were also calculated. The results
   indicated that school levels of the teachers within and between the two
   nations had a significant effect on the mathematics teachers' education
   values. It is thought that these findings may help to show interesting
   differences in systems in Germany and Turkey.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a qualitative research that identifies the
   characteristics of good mathematics teaching from the perspective of
   Mexican high school students. For this purpose, the social
   representations of a good mathematics teacher and a good mathematics
   class were identified in a group of 67 students. In order to obtain
   information, a questionnaire was applied with open questions and focus
   groups with three or four students were organized. The answers to the
   questionnaire were analyzed by locating categories that consolidate a
   specific social representation. The information collected in the focus
   groups contributed to shedding light on the meaning of the words,
   phrases, and notions of common-sense knowledge used by the students. The
   students consider a good teacher to be someone with knowledge and who
   knows how to transmit the knowledge; someone who provides a step-by-step
   explanation and does not leave doubts in the minds of the students;
   someone who is patient/comprehensive and someone who does not make
   classes tedious/boring; someone who teaches in a simple and fun way, and
   arouses interest in students. In a good mathematics class, you are not
   bored, you learn; there are good, varied explanations and lots of
   exercises and students participations.},

Abstract = {School mathematics tends to have developed from the major cultures of
   Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe. However, indigenous cultures in
   particular may have distinctly different systematic ways of referring to
   space and thinking mathematically about spatial activity. Their
   approaches are based on the close link between the environment and
   cultural activity. The affinity to place strengthens the efficient,
   abstract, mathematical system behind the reference and its connection to
   the real world of place and a holistic worldview. This paper sets out to
   present an overview of various approaches to aspects of space and
   geometry by drawing on linguistic and cultural literature, my
   collaborative research in Papua New Guinea, and from personal
   communications with indigenous colleagues in Australia and elsewhere.
   This diversity provides a challenge by which teachers can deconstruct
   their thinking about mathematics and subsequently to review the content
   of teaching and to be more responsive to the diversity of cultural
   backgrounds of students. To assist with recognising ecocultural
   mathematics on space and geometry, 4 principles are established and
   discussed on language structures, reference lines and points, measures
   of space and worldviews and interpretations of space as place.},

Abstract = {The pedagogical practices of mathematics education for young children in
   English and Korean pre-schools were compared through analyses of
   interviews with practitioners, observations of classroom activities and
   an examination of documents related to the planning and implementation
   of mathematics education. Practitioners in both countries used
   integrated activities to teach mathematics, although they used such
   activities more frequently in nurseries than in reception classes in
   England and more frequently in state settings than in independent
   settings in Korea. Furthermore, mathematics education was more
   structured, more likely to be led by an adult and less holistic in
   reception classes than in nurseries in England, whereas it was more
   structured and didactic in independent than in state settings in Korea.
   However, mathematics education in England was more systematic, used a
   more individualised approach and incorporated a variety of hands-on
   materials and rigorous outdoor activities, whereas it was more
   group-oriented and utilised limited materials and fewer outdoor
   activities in Korea.},

Abstract = {Educators and policymakers envision the future of education in Egypt as
   enabling learners to acquire scientific inquiry and problem-solving
   skills. In this article, we describe the validation of a model for
   problem solving and the design of instruments for evaluating new
   teaching methods in Egyptian science classes. The instruments were based
   on an established model for problem solving and were designed to assess
   seventh grade students' problem solving, experimental strategy
   knowledge, achievement and motivation towards science. The test for
   assessing students' knowledge has been developed based on the topic,
   density and buoyancy which will be taught in seventh grade in a later
   intervention study. The instruments were partly self-developed and
   partly adapted from newly performed studies on strategy knowledge and
   problem solving in Germany. All instruments were translated into Arabic;
   the translation process and quality control are described. In order to
   determine the quality of the instruments, 44 students in Egypt completed
   the questionnaires and tests. The study's aim to develop and validate
   the instruments did require an ad hoc and typical sample which was drawn
   from an accessible population. Accordingly, the characteristics of the
   sample are described. Data were analysed according to the classical test
   theory, but to underpin the results, the instruments were additionally
   analysed using the even stronger Rasch model. The findings demonstrated
   the reliability of the items and aspects of validity. In addition, this
   study showed how test items can be successfully developed and adapted in
   an international study and applied in a different language.},

Abstract = {How individual characteristics affect the acquisition of knowledge in
   teacher education has been widely unexplored thus far. The ``Teacher
   Education and Development Study-Learning to Teach Mathematics
   (TEDS-M){''} provides a database for examining this research question
   across countries. Based on the Taiwanese and German sample of TEDS-M,
   the relationship between future lower secondary mathematics teachers'
   knowledge and their affective, cognitive and socio-demographic
   characteristics was examined using multilevel modelling whilst
   controlling for the teachers' opportunities to learn. The results reveal
   that in Germany, teacher knowledge is more strongly affected by future
   teachers' individual characteristics than teacher knowledge in Taiwan.
   These results are interpreted against the background of cultural
   differences between ``the West{''} and ``the East{''} or
   ``individualism{''} and ``collectivism{''}, respectively.},

Abstract = {In general, mathematical representations such as formulae, numbers, and
   graphs are the inseparable components in science used to better describe
   or explain scientific phenomena or knowledge. Regardless of their
   necessity and benefit, science seems to be difficult for some students,
   as a result of the mathematical representations and problem solving used
   in scientific inquiry. In this regard, several studies have attributed
   students' decreasing interest in science to the presence of these
   mathematical representations. In order to better understand student
   learning difficulties caused by mathematical components, the current
   study investigates student understanding of a familiar science concept
   and its mathematical component (pH value and logarithms). Student
   responses to a questionnaire and a follow-up interview were examined in
   detail. ``Measure{''} and ``concentration{''} were key criteria for
   students' understanding of pH values. In addition, only a few students
   understood logarithms on a meaningful level. According to students'
   understanding of scientific phenomena and mathematical structures, five
   different student models and the critical features of each type were
   identified. Further analysis revealed the existence of three domains
   that characterize these five types: object, operation, and function. By
   suggesting the importance of understanding scientific phenomena as a
   ``function,{''} the current study reveals what needs to be taught and
   emphasized in order to help students obtain a level of scientific
   meaning that is appropriate for their grade.},

Abstract = {The aim of the research was to compare espoused beliefs about teaching
   and learning and reported practices for the teachers of mathematics in
   Latvia. The sample consisted of 390 teachers of mathematics from
   different regions of Latvia. The present research is a part of an
   international comparative research within the NorBa project
   (Nordic-Baltic Comparative Research in Mathematics Education) that makes
   use of a quantitative questionnaire for mathematics teachers. The
   results show that the espoused beliefs of Latvian teachers of
   mathematics on efficient teaching tend more to a constructivist
   approach, whilst reported practices are more oriented to a traditional
   approach; yet, there exist statistically significant differences for
   teachers of different social and demographical groups. The research
   outcomes may be used for the improvement of teacher further education
   programmes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to enhance the teaching and learning of
   matter and its properties for grade 6 students. The development of a
   conceptual change approach instructional unit was undertaken for this
   purpose. Pre- and post-concept surveys, classroom observations, and
   student and teacher interviews were used to collect data. The teaching
   activities not only challenged and encouraged students' conceptual
   change but also indicated that teachers needed to develop their content
   knowledge and teaching strategies. The participants developed more
   scientific conceptions and were able to apply these in appropriate
   contexts. This study illustrates how a conceptual change approach can be
   accomplished in the Thai context.},

Abstract = {This study examined standard 6 and 8 (Standards 6 and 8 are the sixth
   and eighth years, respectively, of primary level schooling in Kenya.)
   students' perceptions of how they use mathematics and science outside
   the classroom in an attempt to learn more about students' everyday
   mathematics and science practice. The knowledge of students' everyday
   mathematics and science practice may assist teachers in helping students
   be more powerful mathematically and scientifically both in doing
   mathematics and science in school and out of school. Thirty-six students
   at an urban school and a rural school in Kenya were interviewed before
   and after keeping a log for a week where they recorded their everyday
   mathematics and science usage. Through the interviews and log sheets, we
   found that the mathematics that these students perceived they used
   outside the classroom could be classified as 1 of the 6 activities that
   Bishop (Educ Stud Math 19: 179-191, 1988) has called the 6 fundamental
   mathematical activities and was also connected to their perception of
   whether they learned mathematics outside school. Five categories of
   students' perceptions of their out-of-school science usage emerged from
   the data, and we found that 4 of our codes coincided with 2 activities
   identified by Lederman \& Lederman (Sci Child 43(2): 53, 2005) as part
   of the nature of science and 2 of Bishop's categories. We found that the
   science these students perceived that they used was connected to their
   views of what science is.},

Abstract = {Utilizing video study methodology where participants, as well as the
   researcher, analyzed their own video data, this research examined the
   nature of students talking aloud during peer collaborations in
   mathematics. The findings suggest that students engage in three types of
   talking aloud: (1) clarification of thinking (i.e. spontaneous
   utterances related to the mathematical task); (2) expressions of
   confusion (i.e. ``I don't understand!{''}), with the explicit intent of
   eliciting support from peers; or (3) a combination of (1) and (2). The
   findings also show that students do not perceive other students' talking
   aloud as an inter-communicative gesture. This research highlights the
   importance emphasizing to students that talking aloud during peer
   collaborations should be viewed as a potential antecedent to
   communicative interaction and the importance of teaching students how to
   listen to one another.},

Title = {AN ANALYSIS OF INDONESIAN AND JAPANESE STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDINGS OF

Abstract = {This study investigated Indonesian and Japanese students' understandings
   of macroscopic and submicroscopic levels of representing matter and its
   changes and the difficulties they have with these concepts. A
   multiple-choice questionnaire was constructed and delivered to 447
   Indonesian and 446 Japanese public senior high school students. The data
   were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings
   of the study show students' understandings of macro-and submicroscopic
   levels are stronger for higher-grade levels, except that the Indonesian
   students' pattern is slightly different. The average percentage of
   students responding correctly on the macroscopic level ranges between
   62\% and 69\% (Indonesia) and between 58\% and 73\% (Japanese), whereas
   on the submicroscopic level ranges between 56\% and 62\% (Indonesian)
   and 44\% and 66\% (Japanese). Their understandings of the macroscopic
   level, however, are higher than for the submicroscopic level. The
   soundness of students' understandings of the concepts increases with
   grade level, except for Indonesian pattern slightly different. The
   average percentage of students responding correctly ranges between 37\%
   and 48\% (Indonesian) and between 28\% and 52\% (Japanese). Furthermore,
   students' level of sound understandings of the concepts is lower than
   their understandings on either the macroscopic level or the
   submicroscopic level. It is found that students have great difficulties
   with and hold some alternative conceptions of the concepts of
   homogeneous mixtures, phase changes from solid to liquid, and phase
   changes from solid to gas. The study has implications, for example, the
   use of several routes to meaningful learning and the careful use of
   technical words.},

Abstract = {The present study observed how Taiwanese college students'
   epistemological beliefs about mathematics evolved during a year-long
   historical approach calculus course. On the basis of the characteristics
   of initial accounts, seven students were invited to participate in this
   study and were divided into two groups. An open-ended questionnaire,
   mathematics biographies, in-class reports, and follow-up semi-structured
   interviews served as instruments for identifying their epistemological
   beliefs. Furthermore, four randomly selected students from another
   calculus class constituted the control group. Results indicated that
   most of the students receiving this course exhibited relatively
   significant changes in their epistemological beliefs of mathematics, but
   trends and extents in their epistemological development varied across
   groups as well as individuals. This study identifies the potential
   relationships among the course features, initial beliefs, and the
   tendency of belief development, followed by a discussion of the
   mechanism of belief change and an afterthought on HPM approach.},

Title = {The Effect of the Online Flipped Learning Model on Secondary School
   Students' Academic Achievement, Attitudes Towards Their Mathematics
   Course, and Cognitive Load},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Month = {2024 FEB 20},
Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the effect of the online flipped learning
   model (OFLM) when integrated into a mathematics course in an emergency
   remote teaching process on seventh grade students' academic achievement,
   their attitudes towards their mathematics course, and their cognitive
   load. The study was designed as a crossover experimental research model
   and conducted in two stages. In the first stage, 26 girls constituted
   the experimental group and 22 boys constituted the control group. In the
   second stage, the experimental and control groups were switched. In both
   stages, an academic achievement test was administered to the groups
   before and after implementation, an attitude test towards the
   mathematics course was applied to the experimental group before and
   after each stage, and a cognitive load test was administered to the
   groups after the live online classes each week. Also, the students'
   views about OFLM were obtained through qualitative methods. The findings
   indicate that there is a significant difference between the academic
   achievement of the experimental and control groups in favour of the
   experimental group in the first stage. However, in the second stage, no
   significant difference was found between the groups. Students had a more
   positive attitude towards the mathematics course when the flipped
   learning model was used. There was a significant difference in favour of
   the experimental groups in the cognitive load of the experimental and
   control groups in both stages except for the first week. This study
   provides evidence that OFLM contributed positively to the mathematics
   learning of secondary school students in distance education.},

   Goals, and Parents},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 7},
Abstract = {The undergraduate college years are a critical time when students are
   beginning to think seriously about their career interests, and it is
   critical that students have a positive outlook for their mathematical
   learning if they are going to pursue math-related STEM majors. The
   current research with 748 undergraduate math students found that the
   more they endorsed a fixed mindset, the more they were likely to
   experience math anxiety, a relationship partially explained by their
   adoption of mastery-avoidance and performance-avoidance goals.
   Furthermore, the degree of this mediation effect did not differ for men
   and women. While women were not more likely to hold a fixed mindset for
   their math intelligence, they did report higher scores for math anxiety
   in comparison to men. In addition, if students felt that when they were
   growing up, their parents were uncomfortable helping them with math
   homework, it also led to students' math anxiety, and this was partially
   explained by influencing students' fixed mindset beliefs about their
   math intelligence.},

Title = {Teachers' Knowledge of Fractions, Ratios, and Proportional
   Relationships: the Relationship Between Two Theoretically Connected
   Content Areas},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Teachers' knowledge of the subject matter is considered an important
   component of their expertise in teaching mathematics. Yet how teachers'
   understanding of one content area is related to other content areas has
   not been investigated in depth. We explored this question by
   investigating teachers' knowledge of two theoretically related areas:
   (1) fractions and (2) ratios and proportional relationships. We also
   investigated the extent to which teachers' educational backgrounds are
   related to their understanding of these concepts. Based on the results
   obtained from structural equation modeling and path analysis, we found
   that teachers' knowledge of these two concepts is highly interdependent,
   forming a single construct. Furthermore, holding a credential in
   teaching mathematics, the route teachers took to enter teaching, and
   their undergraduate majors were associated with their knowledge of these
   concepts. This study illustrates the importance of attending to the
   theoretical relationships among different content areas when assessing
   teachers' subject matter knowledge and provides initial evidence that
   teachers' subject matter knowledge may be unidimensional for
   theoretically related domains.},

Abstract = {Learning progressions (LPs) are cognitive models that describe the
   development of scientific knowledge and practices in students. They are
   constructed based on learning theories and student data. Scholars have
   advocated for using LPs to align curriculum, instruction, and assessment
   into a coherent system, and by doing so, promote productive learning
   (Duncan \& Hmelo-Silver, 2009; National Research Council {[}NRC], 2005,
   2007). Systematic validation can be used to monitor and evaluate how
   well LPs enhance the coherence in curriculum-instruction-assessment
   systems. A framework for systematic validation of LP research is
   presented in this article, which illustrates Kane's argument-based
   validation approach (Kane, 2013) can be applied to science LP research.
   In the framework, an interpretation/use argument and a validity argument
   are established to ensure that the LP aligns curriculum, instruction,
   and assessment into a coherent system. The interpretation/use argument
   contains three claims and their assumptions. The three claims are the
   LP, students' proficiency measured by the LP, and the use of the LP to
   inform teaching. The validity argument specifies what and how
   theoretical rationale and empirical evidence are obtained and used to
   evaluate those assumptions and hence the claims. We use the activities,
   data, and results from the Mathematical Thinking in Science (MTS)
   project to illustrate how these two arguments can be built in an
   iterative and progressive manner. The framework, along with our
   experiences and lessons learned, will be of value to other researchers
   as they conduct their own LP studies.},

Abstract = {Scientific knowledge is a primary resource that scientists use to shape
   their activities to make sense of natural phenomena. Support for
   students' adaptation of scientific knowledge can enhance their ability
   to make sense of the natural world. This study aims to examine how
   ecological concepts are used when students plan field-based modeling of
   ecological phenomena and to identify teachers' support for students' use
   of ecological concepts. This study adapts the categorization of
   ecological concepts as natural, functional, and integrative according to
   how they are used in ecological research. With this foundation, we
   examine a field-based modeling activity that was implemented in a middle
   school science club. The goal of this activity was to develop models
   that make sense of ecological phenomena through processes that involve
   field investigations. Video recordings and transcriptions of the
   activities were analyzed as the main data sources. The analysis results
   reveal how different types of ecological concepts are used in modeling
   and illustrate how teachers support students' use of different
   ecological concepts. Based on these findings, we discuss instructional
   supports to expand the resources that students can use in field-based
   modeling of ecological phenomena and the importance of domain-specific
   knowledge in making sense of the natural world.},

Abstract = {There has been considerable research into how children solve
   single-digit addition problems for more than a century now, which has
   brought about significant changes to the ways teachers' support children
   to retrieve single-digit addition facts. In this project, we examine
   what makes an addition problem difficult to retrieve in light of
   contemporary teaching approaches, based on both student performance and
   teacher perceptions. Australian primary school students in Years 3 and 4
   (n = 166) solved 36 single-digit addition problems under two different
   conditions during a structured interview. These data were then used to
   create the Difficulty Retrieving Addition Facts (DRAF) measure, which we
   propose as a contemporary measure of single-digit addition problem
   difficulty to supersede older measures developed in a different era of
   instruction. We then invited Australian primary school teachers (n = 49)
   to complete a questionnaire asking them to estimate the percentage of
   students who would be able to rapidly retrieve these same 36
   single-digit addition problems to facilitate comparison between student
   performance and teacher perceptions. We found that although teachers
   were generally accurate in discerning which addition problems students
   would find relatively easy to retrieve and which they would find more
   difficult, they tended to overestimate student capacity to retrieve
   addition facts in general, particularly when the addition fact was
   comparatively difficult. We suggest that this overestimation resulted
   from teacher responses being shaped by curriculum expectations, which
   states that students should be able to recall single-digit addition
   facts by the end of Year 3.},

Abstract = {This research compares the use of triadic dialogue and translanguaging
   in two multilingual grade seven classrooms where algebra is taught in a
   foreign language. Ten lessons in one classroom that involve teaching
   properties and seven lessons in another classroom that involve teaching
   conventions were video- and audio-recoded and then transcribed. Teacher
   and learners' utterances were coded at different levels: school,
   session, interlocutor, language use, and move and function. Quantitative
   analyses and qualitative illustrations of interaction, discourse, and
   translanguaging are reported and analyzed. The triadic dialogue
   (initiation-response-follow-up) turn-taking structure is the dominant
   style of classroom interaction. Dominant functions of the triadic
   dialogue and translanguaging in each classroom are identified and
   analyzed. The findings are discussed from a socio-cultural perspective
   in which language is viewed as a medium for the process of teaching and
   learning.},

Title = {Drama as a Powerful Tool to Enrich Socio-scientific Argumentation},

Abstract = {Socio-scientific argumentation (SSA) is increasingly being recognized as
   a key aspect of scientific literacy. Much of the reason for this is that
   this skill is crucial for helping students to become active participants
   in twenty-first-century democratic societies in which the construction
   of informed and critical views of socio-scientific issues (e.g. climate
   change, COVID-19 vaccination, genetic testing) plays a fundamental role.
   The problem is that instructors rarely give students explicit and
   research-based opportunities to enrich their SSA skills. Therefore, the
   aim of this study was to provide evidence that drama can be used as a
   platform to enrich argumentation in genetic testing. The data were
   derived from the written responses and the audio recordings of
   seventy-six university students (37 females and 39 males, 16-29 years
   old) in Colombia during a complete drama-based teaching-learning
   sequence (TLS) supervised by the same instructor. The outcomes suggest
   that the sequence can be used to enrich argumentation in genetic testing
   as it effectively provided participants with explicit opportunities to
   produce both arguments and counterarguments about the controversy
   whether the use of genetic tests among people should be encouraged. This
   study contributes to the literature on SSA in science education by
   demonstrating that drama is a promising tool to enhance argumentation
   about science-based social issues.},

Title = {Students Do Not Always Mean What We Think They Mean: A Questioning
   Strategy to Elicit the Reasoning Behind Unexpected Causal Patterns in
   Student System Models},

Abstract = {An ability to engage in system thinking is necessary to understand
   complex problems. While many pre-college students use system modeling
   tools, there is limited evidence of student reasoning about causal
   relationships that interact in diverging and converging chains, and how
   these affect system behavior. A chemistry unit on gas phenomena was
   implemented in two successive years with 73 high school students.
   Although the phenomena could be explained with simple linear causal
   reasoning, many student models included surprising and problematic
   causal chains and non-linear patterns. Commonly, discussion about
   student models in classrooms and interviews focuses on individual causal
   relationships. However, in our experience, this can fail to bring to the
   surface conceptual issues that result from the combination of two or
   more relationships. Using interview data from 19 students, we looked for
   instances where students explained their conceptions and we identified
   questioning strategies that elicited these explanations. Questions that
   appeared most productive asked about distal relationships between
   nonadjacent variables in model substructures of three to four variables.
   In response to these questions, eight students expressed their thinking
   about relationship combinations, including unexpected reasoning that had
   not emerged during classroom instruction. Using exemplars from three
   interviews, we argue that students engage in complex causal reasoning
   that may be implicit and unexpected, and that if this is not recognized,
   it cannot be responded to during instruction. We suggest that using
   model substructures as a mutual visual referent along with a simple
   questioning strategy shows promise for helping students make their
   causal reasoning explicit.},

Title = {Effectiveness of Argument-Based Inquiry Approach on Grade 8 Students'
   Science Content Achievement, Metacognition, and Epistemological Beliefs},

Abstract = {The quasi-experimental, two-group (treatment and comparison),
   pretest-posttest study of metacognition, epistemological beliefs, and
   science content achievement explored the effectiveness of argument-based
   inquiry (ABI) instruction as opposed to traditional teacher-directed
   lectures and structured activities. Participants included 60 eight-grade
   students attending two intact classes of a middle school located in an
   urban area. One class was treated as the treatment group and the other
   as the comparison group. The students in the treatment group were taught
   for 13 weeks with the ABI approach while those in the comparison group
   were taught using traditional instruction. Data were gathered by
   administering the Epistemological Belief Questionnaire, Metacognitive
   Awareness Inventory, and Science Content Achievement Test as pretest and
   posttest and were analyzed using t-test and MANOVA. The findings
   revealed that the treatment group significantly outperformed the
   comparison group in terms of science content achievement, metacognition,
   and epistemological beliefs. Treatment group students' scores in science
   content achievement, epistemological beliefs (i.e., justification and
   development), and most of the dimensions of metacognition (i.e.,
   declarative knowledge, planning, information management, debugging,
   monitoring, and evaluation) significantly improved as ABI was applied.
   However, the ABI approach was not found to improve students'
   epistemological beliefs concerning the source and tentative nature of

Abstract = {We examined widely used popular calculus textbooks to explore
   opportunities to learn the limit concept. Definitions, worked problems,
   and exercise problems were coded to examine if these tasks allow
   students to use informal thinking to coordinate domain and range
   processes to understand the infinite process of limit. Results revealed
   many exercise problems are step 1 tasks in genetic decomposition, where
   students only need to evaluate a function at one point. Such tasks
   prevent students from using their informal thinking productively.
   Recommendations and implications to calculus students and instructors
   are also mentioned.},

Abstract = {There is substantial research in science education about students',
   teachers', and scientists' views of nature of science (NOS). Many
   studies have used NOS frameworks that focus on particular ideas such as
   tentativeness of scientific knowledge and cultural embeddedness of
   science. In this paper, we investigate NOS from the perspective of the
   Family Resemblance Approach (FRA) which considers clusters of ideas
   about science in terms of categories that offer a comprehensive
   analytical lens to studying NOS views. The empirical study re-analyzes
   NOS views obtained from 7 and 8th grade students, science teachers, and
   scientists using the FRA lens. Statements from all three groups were
   obtained using a free-write questionnaire on nature of knowledge and
   nature of knowing. The statements were reclassified using the FRA
   framework. Epistemic network analysis (ENA) was applied to the
   statements produced by each group of participants, and the resulting
   network models were interpreted and compared. The results show that
   student and teacher network models possessed no central idea, and more
   tangible ideas about science were frequently connected. Scientist
   network models showed more connections across their statements which
   indicate a higher degree of agreement and coherence among a variety of
   ideas compared to student and teacher network models. The paper
   discusses the findings as well as the methodological contributions, and
   concludes with implications for future research.},

Abstract = {Promoting positive student attitudes towards stochastics has become a
   core goal of statistics education reform, and we argue that this starts
   with the teachers during their teacher preparation program. Building on
   previous work assessing teachers' attitudes, we focus on how pre-service
   teacher attitudes vary across different dimensions, and how these
   patterns can inform teacher training. We present results from assessing
   attitudes towards stochastics and its teaching for a sample of 269
   pre-service Chilean mathematics teachers across three topics:
   descriptive statistics, probability, and statistical inference. Using a
   quantitative approach, and considering attitudes towards content and
   pedagogy, we focus on describing the main attitudinal differences among
   these three areas. In general, we found positive attitude towards the
   content and its teaching in all three areas, but with differences among
   them, primarily in the area of statistical inference. We end with some
   proposals aimed at improving teacher preparation, focusing on helping
   pre-service teachers understand the utility and overarching process of
   statistical investigations.},

Abstract = {Many students are becoming increasingly disengaged in school,
   particularly in mathematics. This is an important problem as lack of
   engagement may threaten students' achievement and performance in
   mathematics. A flipped learning pedagogy, which encourages students to
   take an active role in learning mathematics, has become a widely
   researched topic in recent years. However, few empirical studies to date
   have focused on the influence of flipped learning on student engagement
   in secondary mathematics classrooms. This qualitatively oriented study
   aimed to extend existing research on the role of flipped learning in
   behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement by adopting a social
   constructivist perspective to examine a secondary mathematics classroom.
   The participants were 33 high school students and their mathematics
   teacher, from whom data were gathered using multiple empirical methods.
   The results indicate that a flipped learning pedagogy has the potential
   to play a positive role in behavioral, cognitive, and emotional
   engagement as it provides learners with many possibilities for the
   learning of mathematics. However, to successfully flip learning, it is
   important to have a well-developed interactive design and to encourage
   social interaction in mathematics teaching and learning. Engagement was
   found to be negatively affected when the students had a negative
   perception of flipped learning and failed to complete the pre-class
   tasks. Overall, our results indicate that mathematics education can
   benefit from a flipped learning pedagogy as it has the potential to
   strengthen students' engagement and mathematics learning in a social
   environment.},

Abstract = {Engaging with learner errors in mathematics classrooms is an important
   aspect of teacher pedagogy which can support learner identification with
   mathematics. This study examined the opportunities that teachers
   provided for the construction of learner identities based on how the
   teachers spoke about and interacted with learner errors in two secondary
   school mathematics classrooms. Data were collected over two years in the
   form of videotaped lessons, field notes, photographed learner notebooks
   and audiotaped interviews with participants, and were analyzed
   qualitatively. Two ways in which teachers spoke about errors are
   discussed: errors are contagious and errors are lessons. How the
   teachers spoke about and interacted with errors were informed by their
   views of learners and their reasoning in mathematics, which shaped the
   identities they offered learners. We show that while learners'
   experiences of their teachers' approaches to errors informed their
   identification with mathematics to some extent, the learners also played
   a role in the construction of their mathematical identities.},

Abstract = {This article presents a study focused on analysing the effectiveness of
   an activity about the use of analogies in science communication. The
   activity consisted of reading two science articles published in a
   prestigious digital newspaper about the first image of a black hole. The
   purpose was (i) to identify and analyse the analogies used in the news
   articles and (ii) to assess the advantages and possible limitations of
   their use in communicating scientific ideas. The activity was performed
   with prospective primary education teachers (PPTs) who were receiving
   instruction in science teaching. Their responses were analysed
   descriptively with a rubric developed in accordance with methods of
   qualitative content analysis. The results indicate that the PPTs
   achieved a moderate progression in their conceptions of the use of
   analogies in science communication and, overall, it can be said that the
   activity had a positive educative effect. Finally, a discussion of the
   implications and limitations of the study for PPTs' training in the use
   of analogies is presented.},

Abstract = {Central in the frameworks that describe algebra from K-12 is the idea
   that algebraic thinking is not a single construct, but consists of
   several algebraic thinking strands. Validation studies exploring this
   idea are relatively scarce. This study used structural equation modeling
   techniques to analyze data of middle school students' performance on
   tasks that correspond to four algebraic thinking strands: (i)
   Generalized Arithmetic, (ii) Functional Thinking, (iii) Modeling
   Languages, and (iv) Algebraic Proof. The study also examined the role
   that cognitive abilities play in students' algebraic thinking. Results
   emerging from confirmatory factor analysis showed that the proposed
   model adequately explains students' algebraic thinking. Additionally,
   results emerging form latent path analysis showed that students are
   first able to solve Functional Thinking tasks and only when this is
   achieved, they proceed to solve Generalized Arithmetic tasks, then
   Modeling Languages tasks, and finally Algebraic Proof tasks. Lastly, the
   quantitative analyses indicated that students' cognitive abilities
   (analogical, serial, and spatial reasoning) predict students' algebraic
   thinking abilities.},

Abstract = {It is a well-known fact that many students struggle during the
   transition from school to university mathematics. The aim of our
   quantitative study was to clarify the role of students' beliefs
   concerning the nature of mathematics for a successful transition. We
   distinguish between static beliefs (mathematics as a finished system of
   rules, facts and formula) and dynamic beliefs (mathematics as a dynamic
   discipline with applications in everyday life). In particular, we
   examined whether first year students' beliefs are suitable to predict
   students' exam achievement and their satisfaction (as criteria for a
   successful transition) and how students' beliefs develop during the
   transition. Therefore, we used questionnaires at the beginning and in
   the middle of the first term at university. Our results indicate that
   dynamic beliefs decrease during transition, whereas static beliefs
   remain rather stable. This seems problematic since dynamic beliefs
   turned out to negatively predict students' dropout intention, while
   static beliefs are a negative predictor of students' achievement in real
   analysis. Furthermore, the beliefs assessed in the middle of the term
   had a stronger predictive power than those at the beginning of the term.
   Based on these results, we discuss implications for the teaching of
   mathematics during the transition.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that dialogic teacher talk not only supports
   students' understanding but also raises their interest. However, there
   is little, if any, research on the connection between dialogic talk and
   student interest in classroom situations. To investigate this
   connection, we collected video observations and experience sampling
   data. In total, 87 middle school students aged 14 to 16 participated in
   the study. Data were collected from the classes of six science teachers,
   and three lessons were video recorded in each teacher's classroom.
   During the lessons, students were asked several times to express their
   interest in the situation through the experience sampling method (ESM).
   The measurements took place in situations where the teacher either
   talked with the students or talked to the whole group of students. The
   talk situations were categorised as dialogic or non-dialogic, based on
   the video recording. On a five-point scale of interest, the median value
   was 3.3 in non-dialogic talk situations and 3.5 in dialogic talk
   situations. We hypothesised that students' interest would be higher in
   dialogic talk situations than in non-dialogic talk situations. The
   hypothesis was tested with a related samples Wilcoxon signed rank test,
   and the results supported the hypothesis (Z = - 2.62;p < 0.05). The
   results suggest that dialogic talk may trigger students' interest in
   science learning.},

Abstract = {Educators have been interested in the global maker movement as it
   provides hands-on learning opportunities for youths to enhance their
   knowledge and skills of science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM). This study aims to understand the maker movement
   from the perspective of frame analysis and collective action frames.
   Based on 33 interviews with makers from China, Europe, and the USA, we
   use diagnostic and prognostic frames to analyze the problems related to
   makerspaces and how makers solve these problems. The results highlight
   that makerspaces are deeply rooted in local communities as they both
   integrate local expectations with their ideal of making and depend on
   communities to solve internal problems. Makers also proactively change
   the mindset of what constitutes and defines making of other actors (e.g.
   public). Discussion focuses on the roles of governments and the inequity
   of resource mobilization in terms of STEM learning in the movement.},

Abstract = {Proportional reasoning is the basis for most medication calculation
   processes and is fundamental for high-quality care and patient safety.
   We designed a simulated Medication Mathematics (siMMath) environment to
   support proportional reasoning in transitioning via concreteness fading
   between two mediators. The first mediator is simulated nursing tools of
   medication preparation. The second is a ratio-table setup which is used
   as a goal representation, which enables one to spatially hold in place
   different quantities in their relative proportion. We conducted a
   two-part study with nursing students. Part 1 was a quasi-experimental
   pretest-intervention-posttest design assessing the effectiveness of
   learning, by evaluating four categories of medical calculation
   questionnaire items (solid medications, unit conversion, concentrations,
   infusion rates). We used the Noelting proportional reasoning test to
   evaluate the generalizability and abstraction of proportional reasoning.
   Part 1 included an experimental group (n=96) learning with siMMath, and
   a comparison group (n=73) learning with an equation-based lecture
   approach. Part 2 employed a case study design to characterize the
   learning process. The experimental group's learning gains were
   significantly higher than the comparison group's for the two most
   challenging categories of the medication calculation problems
   questionnaire, namely concentrations and infusion rates. Furthermore,
   the experimental group's learning gains were significantly higher than
   the comparison group's for formal operational reasoning on the Noelting
   test. Students who used a ratio-table setup scored significantly higher
   on the Noelting posttest questionnaire. Nursing students who learned
   with the siMMath environment overcame difficulties in proportional
   reasoning to the highest levels and extended this understanding to other
   contexts.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the Common
   Knowledge Construction Model (CKCM) lesson sequence on grade 7 students'
   conceptual understanding of the ``water pollution{''} topic. Within a
   pre-experimental (one group pre-test/post-test) research design, this
   study was conducted with 25 (12 females and 13 males) grade 7 students
   in a lower secondary school in the district of YeniAYehir, Bursa,
   Turkey. To collect data, word association test (WAT), conceptual
   understanding test (CUT), and interviews were employed. After
   calculating the students' responses to the WAT and the CUT, their scores
   were imported into SPSS 15.0 (TM) to run paired samples t test and
   descriptive analysis. Also, the interviewees' responses to principal
   interview questions were thematically analyzed in regard to their
   similarities and differences. The results of the study showed that the
   CKCM lesson sequence resulted in a better conceptual understanding of
   the ``water pollution{''} topic. The current study recommends to employ
   the CKCM lesson sequence for different science topics and varied grades
   and courses.},

Abstract = {When translating word problems into equations, a common error consists
   of using the same letter to refer to two different quantities. This
   error, called multiple referents for the unknown, can be connected to
   the existence of deictic or indexical expressions within the problem
   statement. This paper aims to analyse the influence of indexical
   expressions on the incidence of the multiple referents for the unknown
   error. Results from a quantitative study with 117 Spanish secondary
   students show a significantly higher number of such type of error when
   the problem statement contains indexical expressions. The analysis of
   students' performances in subsequent interviews indicates that this
   error may be due to the fragmented reading of statements.},

Abstract = {Students who study science in single-sex and coeducational schools have
   attracted lots of attention from the education community. However,
   changes to students' attitudes toward science as they progress to higher
   grades in these schools are not clearly understood. The aim of this
   study was to compare the changes in attitudes toward science among lower
   secondary students (Grade 7 to Grade 9) in single-sex and coeducational
   schools in Brunei. A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect
   data from 1,034 students. Despite a significant nonlinear decline in
   attitudes toward science from Grade 7 to Grade 9, the attitudes remained
   positive. This decline in attitudes toward science was at a minimum for
   students in the coeducational school, and it followed the following
   order: single-sex boys > single-sex girls > coeducational students. The
   decline was independent of the initial perceived values of the students'
   attitudes, and it followed different trends when the data of the
   same-sex students from single-sex and coeducational schools were
   compared. Male students from the SSB school had more chances for
   significant decline as they progressed from Year 7 to Year 9. Brunei and
   countries with similar intentions to expand single-sex and coeducation
   school systems can target communication between single-sex and
   coeducation schools so they may learn from each other to improve the
   effectiveness of science teaching and learning processes. We expect that
   academics and administrators can benefit from the results of this study
   to guide their secondary science education policies, curriculum reforms,
   and teaching practices.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate eight preservice middle and
   high school mathematics teachers' solution strategies when solving
   single and multiple proportion problems. Real-world missing-value word
   problems were used in an interview setting to collect information about
   preservice teachers' (PSTs) reasoning about proportional relationships.
   An explanatory case study methodology with multiple cases was used to
   make comparisons within and across cases. Analysis of the
   semi-structured interviews with each PST revealed that using practical
   problems, in which plastic gears and a mini balance system were
   provided, and multiple proportion problems facilitated the PSTs'
   recognition of the proportional relationships in their solutions.
   Therefore, they avoided using cross-multiplication and erroneous
   strategies in those problems. Among the strategies that the PSTs used in
   solving single and multiple proportion problems, the ratio table
   strategy was the most frequent and effective strategy. The ratio table
   strategy enabled the PSTs to recognize the constant ratio and product
   relationships more than the other strategies. The results of this study
   illuminate how PSTs reason about proportional relationships when they
   cannot rely on computation methods like cross-multiplication.},

Abstract = {This study examined preservice teachers' (PSTs) capacity for lesson
   planning in a university-based teacher preparation program in the USA
   Participants (n = 126) wrote lesson plans in three approaches:
   synthesis, creation, and modification. Findings indicate that PSTs who
   modified preexisting lesson plans produced better lesson plans than
   their peers and reported higher efficacy in their use of the lesson plan
   in their field experiences. This study supports the notion that the
   efficacy of first-year teaching lies more appropriately in the area of
   enacting curriculum than in the area of designing curriculum. With
   respect to career-long learning, PSTs' abilities to do curriculum work
   are likely to improve, as they grow more familiar with students and
   existing excellent curricula over years. Although the study presents a
   snapshot of U.S. preservice teachers' capacity for curriculum design,
   the findings may serve to inform the literature on the developmental
   aspect of curriculum design for teacher education systems across the
   world.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the effects of a cognitive acceleration program in
   mathematics classes on Tongan students' achievements, motivation and
   self-regulation. Cognitive Acceleration in Mathematics Education (CAME)
   is a program developed at King's College and implemented worldwide with
   the aim of improving students' thinking skills, mathematics performance
   and attitudes. The first author adapted the program materials to Tongan
   educational context and provided support to participating teachers for 8
   months. This study employed a quasi-experimental design with 219 Year 8
   students as the experimental group and 119 Year 8 students as the
   comparison group. There were a significant differences in the mean
   scores between the pre-test and post-test of the three instruments that
   were employed in the study, indicating that learning mathematics under
   the CAME program had a positive effect on levels of students'
   self-regulation, motivation and mathematics achievement. Students also
   reported changes to the ways they learn mathematics.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to propose an operational idea for
   developing algebraic thinking in the absence of alphanumeric symbols.
   The paper reports on a design experiment encouraging preschool children
   to use the associative property algebraically. We describe the
   theoretical basis of the design, the tasks used, and examples of
   algebraic thinking in 5-6-year-old children. Theoretically, the paper
   makes a critical distinction between operational and structural meanings
   of the notion of equality. We argue that mathematical thinking involving
   equality among young learners can comprise both an operational and a
   structural conception and that the operational conception has a side
   that is productively linked to the structural conception. Using
   carefully designed hands-on tasks, the crux of the paper is the
   realization of algebraic thinking (in verbal mathematics) as
   operationally experienced in the ability to transform one number
   structure, with a quantity that is subject to change, into another
   through equality-preserving transformations.},

Title = {The Transition from School to University in Mathematics: Which Influence
   Do School-Related Variables Have?},

Abstract = {Particularly in mathematics, the transition from school to university
   often appears to be a substantial hurdle in the individual learning
   biography. Differences between the characters of school mathematics and
   scientific university mathematics as well as different demands related
   to the learning cultures in both institutions are discussed as possible
   reasons for this phenomenon. If these assumptions hold, the transition
   from school to university could not be considered as a continuous
   mathematical learning path because it would require a realignment of
   students' learning strategies. In particular, students could no longer
   rely on the effective use of school-related individual resources like
   knowledge, interest, or self-concept. Accordingly, students would face
   strong challenges in mathematical learning processes at the beginning of
   their mathematics study at university. In this contribution, we examine
   these assumptions by investigating the role of individual mathematical
   learning prerequisites of 182 first-semester university students
   majoring in mathematics. In line with the assumptions, our results
   indicate only a marginal influence of school-related mathematical
   resources on the study success of the first semester. In contrast,
   specific precursory knowledge related to scientific mathematics and
   students' abilities to develop adequate learning strategies turn out as
   main factors for a successful transition phase. Implications for the
   educational practice will be discussed.},

Abstract = {Competitions are discussed as a measure to foster students' interest,
   especially for highly gifted and talented students. In the current
   study, participants of a cognitive school competition in science were
   compared to non-participants of the same age group (14-15) who either
   did not participate in any competition or who participated in a
   non-cognitive sports competition. The study focused on goal orientations
   and competence beliefs and analyzed outcomes as a foundation for further
   improvements of enrichment measures and competitions with regard to
   fostering students' interest especially in science. The results showed
   considerable differences (and some unexpected similarities) between
   groups: Science competition participants were more learning goal
   oriented, had less performance avoidance goals, and showed less work
   avoidance than non-participants. Social self-concept was higher but was
   moderated by GPA. Considerable gender differences were found as well.
   These findings are discussed with regard to further research and
   possibilities for improvement of science competitions.},

   Practice, 12, 5-14, 2011) was used. This instrument depends on 5 basic
   criteria: (a) type or level, (b) surface features, (c) relatedness to
   text, (d) existence and properties of a caption, and (e) degree of
   correspondence between representations comprising a multiple
   representation. The results of the study revealed that the chemical
   representations used in the selected textbooks are focused on the macro
   level with either implicit or ambiguous labels. Moreover, the selected
   textbooks use very few multiple, hybrid, or mixed representations. In
   addition, most chemical representations are accompanied by problematic
   or no captions. Recommendations for textbook writers and future research
   are discussed in light of these findings.},

Title = {Measuring Critical Thinking in Physics: Development and Validation of a
   Critical Thinking Test in Electricity and Magnetism},

Abstract = {Although the development of critical thinking (CT) is a major goal of
   science education, adequate emphasis has not been given to the
   measurement of CT skills in specific science domains such as physics.
   Recognizing that adequately assessing CT implies the assessment of both
   domain-specific and domain-general CT skills, this study reports on the
   development and validation of a test designed to measure students'
   acquisition of CT skills in electricity and magnetism (CTEM). The CTEM
   items were designed to mirror the structural components of items
   identified in an existing standardized domain-general CT test, and
   targeted content from an introductory Electricity and Magnetism (E\&M)
   course. A preliminary version of the CTEM test was initially piloted on
   three groups of samples: interviews with physics experts (N = 3),
   student cognitive interviews (N = 6), and small-scale paper and pencil
   administration (N = 19). Modifications were made afterwards and the test
   was administered to a different group of second-year students whose
   major was mechanical engineering (N = 45). The results showed that the
   internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .72) and inter-rater
   reliability (Cohen's kappa = .83) of the CTEM test are acceptable. The
   findings overall suggest that the CTEM test can be used to measure the
   acquisition of domain-specific CT skills in E\&M, and a good basis for
   future empirical research that focuses on the integration of CT skills
   within specific subject matter instruction. A broader CT assessment
   framework is proposed and possible research questions that can be
   addressed through the CTEM test are discussed.},

Abstract = {The strong humanistic and ethics-oriented philosophy of Confucianism
   tends to lead people influenced by these principles to undervalue the
   importance of hands-on practice and creativity in education. GreenMech,
   a science and technology contest, was implemented to encourage
   real-world, hands-on problem solving in an attempt to mitigate this
   effect. The self-reported attitudes, values, and intentions of 684
   GreenMech participants from elementary, junior high, and senior high
   schools in Taiwan were subjected to confirmatory analysis with
   structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized model. The
   research findings revealed that the students' problem-solving attitude
   is positively correlated to their perception of their own knowledge
   enrichment and thinking-skill enhancement as a result of participating
   in GreenMech. The findings also suggest that these perceived advantages
   positively influenced the intention to participate in future contests.
   This indicates that a highly competitive contest can be used to promote
   awareness of opportunities, which may enhance thinking skills and enrich
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {This report examines teachers' self-espoused attitudes and beliefs on
   proving in the secondary mathematics classroom. Conclusions were based
   on a questionnaire of 78 US mathematics teachers who had completed at
   least 2 years of teaching mathematics at the secondary level. While
   these teachers placed importance on proving as a general mathematical
   skill, when they discuss their own classrooms, procedural skill
   consistently surpasses proof-related activities in importance for a
   majority of high school teachers. Furthermore, teachers labeling their
   own past experiences in proving as causing anxiety are predictably more
   likely to put less value on proving. Interestingly, the quantity of past
   college mathematics courses is a reverse predictor indicating that
   further study should consider how students perceptions of proving change
   as they pass through a mathematics major.},

Abstract = {Holding scientific conceptions and having the ability to accurately
   predict students' preconceptions are a prerequisite for science teachers
   to design appropriate constructivist-oriented learning experiences. This
   study explored the types and sources of students' preconceptions of
   electric circuits. First, 438 grade 3 (9 years old) students were
   surveyed about their pre-instructional ideas on electric circuits and
   where they developed these ideas. Then, 76 elementary school teachers
   with master's degrees in science education were selected and their
   content knowledge of electric circuits was documented. Next, they were
   asked to make predictions about the kind of preconceptions most grade 3
   students would have about electric circuits and the most dominant source
   of these preconceptions. The results revealed that these skilled
   teachers held scientific conceptions for most of the questions surveyed;
   however, they inaccurately predicted the types and sources of the
   students' prominent alternative preconceptions. Specifically, they
   underestimated the possibility of students holding scientific concepts
   and neglected the effect of students' intuition on their conceptions.
   Implications for teaching and teacher education are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study designed a set of computerized collaboration scripts for
   multi-touch supported collaborative design-based learning and evaluated
   its effects on multiple aspects of metacognitive self-regulation in
   terms of planning and controlling and mathematical literacy achievement
   at higher and lower levels. The computerized scripts provided a sequence
   of guidance for structuring intragroup and intergroup interactions and
   prompting individual metacognitive processes throughout the
   collaborative design phases based on the Think-Pair-Share method. Four
   intact classes of 80 fifth-grade students participated in this study.
   Employing a nonequivalent comparison group quasi-experimental design,
   this study examined whether or not applying the scripts better enhanced
   self-regulation and achievement in a technology-infused mathematics
   learning classroom. Multivariate analyses were conducted to reveal the
   effects on the aspects among the two sets of variables. The results
   showed medium effects on the controlling of metacognitive
   self-regulation and higher level achievement, whereas no significant
   effects were found for the planning aspect and lower level achievement
   between the groups with and without the collaboration scripts. The
   implications of this work in relation to metacognitive processes and
   technology-infused mathematics learning are discussed based on the
   results.},

Abstract = {This study compares students' opportunities to engage in
   transformational (rule-based) algebraic activity between 2 classes
   taught by the same teacher and across 2 topics in beginning algebra:
   forming and investigating algebraic expressions and equivalence of
   algebraic expressions. It comprises 2 case studies; each involves a
   teacher teaching in two 7th grade classes. All 4 classes used the same
   textbook. Analysis of classroom videotapes (15-19 lessons in each class)
   revealed that the opportunities to engage in transformational algebraic
   activity related to forming and investigating algebraic expressions were
   similar in each teacher's 2 classes. By contrast, substantial
   differences were found between 1 teacher's classes with regard to the
   opportunities to engage in transformational algebraic activity related
   to equivalence of algebraic expressions. The discussion highlights the
   contribution of the interplay among the mathematical topic, the teacher,
   and the class to shaping students' learning opportunities. Specifically,
   the mathematical topic appeared to play a prominent role in certain
   situations, with the topic involving deductive reasoning generating high
   variation in classes of 1 teacher but not in the other's.},

Abstract = {Based on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2007
   study and a follow-up national survey, data for 3,901 Taiwanese grade 8
   students were analyzed using structural equation modeling to confirm a
   social-relation-based affection-driven model (SRAM). SRAM hypothesized
   relationships among students' perceived social relationships in science
   class and affective and cognitive learning outcomes to be examined.
   Furthermore, the path coefficients of SRAM for high- and low-achieving
   subgroups were compared. Given the 2-stage stratified clustering design
   for sampling, jackknife replications were conducted to estimate the
   sampling errors for all coefficients in SRAM. Results suggested that
   both perceived teacher-student relationships (PTSR) and perceived peer
   relationships (PPR) exert significant positive effects on students'
   self-confidence in learning science (SCS) and on their positive attitude
   toward science (PATS). These affective learning outcomes (SCS and PATS)
   were found to play a significant role in mediating the perceived social
   relationships (PTSR and PPR) and science achievement. Further results
   regarding the differences in SRAM model fit between high- and
   low-achieving students are discussed, as are the educational and
   methodological implications of this study.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Good conceptual understanding of physics is based on understanding what
   the key concepts are and how they are related. This kind of
   understanding is especially important for physics teachers in planning
   how and in what order to introduce concepts in teaching; connections
   which tie concepts to each other give direction of progress-there is
   ``flux of information{''} so that what was learned before provides the
   basis for learning new ideas. In this study, we discuss how such
   ordering of concepts can be made visible by using concept maps and how
   they can be used in analysing the students' views and ideas about the
   inherent logic of the teaching plans. The approach discussed here is
   informed by the recent cognitively oriented ideas of knowledge
   organisation concentrating on simple knowledge organisation patterns and
   how they form the basis of more complex concept networks. The analysis
   of such concept networks is then very naturally based on the use of
   network theory on analysing the concept maps. The results show that even
   in well-connected maps, there can be abrupt changes in the information
   flux in the way knowledge is passed from the initial levels to the final
   levels. This suggests that handling the information content is very
   demanding and perhaps a very difficult skill for a pre-service teacher
   to master.},

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that mathematical learning builds upon students'
   prior knowledge and understandings, and their identities. In this study,
   this phenomenon is explored with indigenous students in remote community
   schools in outback Australia. Through one-on-one task-based interviews,
   it was found that these students had some clear understandings of the
   measurement concepts involved, although these understandings were often
   idiosyncratic to these students in this context. The task-based
   one-on-one interview gave better insights into students' knowledge than
   the written form of the National Assessment Program-Literacy and
   Numeracy assessment. Nevertheless, the students' conceptions provide a
   useful basis upon which to build subsequent knowledge, understanding and
   skills in the forms required by the formal mathematics curriculum.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to identify children's conceptions of
   learning mathematics and to assess the identified conceptions.
   Children's conceptions are identified by interviewing 73 grade 5
   students in Taiwan. The interviews are analyzed using qualitative data
   analysis methods, which results in a structure of 5 major conceptions,
   each having 2 subconceptions: constructivist (interest and
   understanding), interpretivist (liberty and innovation), objectivist
   (academic goal and perseverance), nativist (confidence and anxiety
   (reverse)), and pragmatist (vocational goal and application). The
   conceptions are assessed with a self-developed questionnaire, titled
   ``the Conception of Learning Mathematics Questionnaire{''} (CLMQ), which
   is administered to 513 grade 5 students in Taiwan and examined with a
   reliability measure, confirmatory factor analysis, and correlations with
   2 criteria: mathematics achievement and approaches to learning
   mathematics. The results show that the CLMQ has desirable internal
   consistency reliability and construct validity. The conceptions are also
   sensibly in relation to the 2 criteria, suggesting that the CLMQ is a
   valid measure for evaluating the quality of children's learning

Abstract = {This paper reports on different underlying structures of the derivative
   schema of three undergraduate students that were considered to be at the
   trans level of development of the derivative schema
   (action-process-object-schema). The derivative schema is characterized
   in terms of the students' ability to explicitly transfer the
   relationship between a function and its first derivative to the
   derivative function and the second derivative. This conscious shift of
   properties of derivatives is differently manifested by the students in
   the trans level of development of the derivative schema and can be
   considered evidence of the different characteristics of the
   thematization of derivative schema. From here we suggest that there are
   different underlying structures in the constructed schema due to the
   consciousness in which students use the relations between a function and
   its derivative.},

Abstract = {Nearly 5,000 self-generated science-related K-12 students' questions,
   classified into seven science subjects, were used to quantitatively
   measure the gender gap in science interests and its change with age. In
   this data set, a difference between boys' and girls' science interests
   did not exist during early childhood, but increased over 20-fold by the
   end of high school. Furthermore, the gap widened in a stereotypical
   manner, with girls being increasingly interested in biology and boys
   more interested in physics and technology. This method could be applied
   for identifying and comparing the gender gap in science interests
   between different populations based on different data sources.},

Title = {A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF A CONCEPT MAPPING ENHANCED
   LABORATORY EXPERIENCE ON TURKISH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF
   ACID-BASE CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {The research reported here consists of the introduction of an
   intervention based on a series of laboratory activities combined with
   concept mapping. The purpose of this intervention was to enhance student
   understanding of acid-base chemistry for tenth grade students' from two
   classes in a Turkish high school. An additional aim was to enhance
   student attitude toward chemistry. In the research design, two cohorts
   of students were compared; those from the intervention group (N=31) and
   a second group (N=28) who were taught in a more traditional manner.
   Student understanding of acidbase chemistry was evaluated with a
   pretest/posttest research design using a purpose-designed instrument,
   the Concept Achievement Test (CAT) consisting of 25 items, 15 multiple
   choice and ten multiple choice with explanation. Alternative conceptions
   identified in the pretest were incorporated into the intervention, which
   thereby sought to move students toward views more in accord with
   scientific views for the concepts. Statistical tests indicate the
   instrument is reliable (with an alpha reliability of 0.81) and the
   analysis of the findings revealed statistically significant differences
   between the intervention and traditional groups with respect to
   conceptual understanding. Examination of student explanations and
   analyses of semi-structured interviews conducted with selected students
   suggest that the main influence was the laboratory activities. Analysis
   of the findings in the context of relevant literature that concept
   mapping in conjunction with laboratory activities is more enjoyable,
   helps student link concepts, and reduces their alternative conceptions.},

Abstract = {This study examines the views of people involved in mathematics
   education regarding the commonly stated goal of using mathematics
   learning to develop deductive reasoning that is usable outside of
   mathematical contexts. The data source includes 21 individual
   semi-structured interviews. The findings of the study show that the
   interviewees ascribed different meanings to the above-stated goal.
   Moreover, none of them said that it is possible to develop formal
   logic-based reasoning useful outside of mathematics, but for different
   reasons. Three distinct views were identified: the
   intervention-argumentation view, the reservation-deductive view, and the
   spontaneity-systematic view. Each interviewee's view was interrelated
   with the interviewee's approach to deductive reasoning and its nature in
   mathematics and outside it.},

Abstract = {This article will describe the dispositions of science teachers in the
   context of a curriculum reform. Using Bourdieu's notions of `habitus'
   and `the field,' the analysis of the data highlights the necessity for
   curriculum reformers to view the field of the science department as a
   contested space. From this understanding flow several subsidiary issues:
   the need to promote disequilibrium and critical conversations around the
   meanings and practices of science education within the department, and
   the need to value and capitalise on the symbolic capital of teacher
   credibility. The article concludes by briefly critiquing recent
   curriculum reforms in Australia.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the procedures and the analysis
   of an instrument designed to measure preservice teachers' ability to
   develop appropriate 5E learning cycle lesson plans. The 5E inquiry
   lesson plan (ILP) rubric is comprised of 12 items with a scoring range
   of zero to four points per item. Content validity was determined through
   the expertise of a panel of five science educators. Sixty six preservice
   teachers enrolled in elementary science methods at three universities
   prepared lesson plans, which were scored by their instructors using the
   ILP rubric. Using a Pearson two-tailed correlation, inter-rater
   reliability was established at a value of 0.83. An exploratory factor
   analysis provided evidence of construct validity, with three factors.
   The factors included (1) explore, (2) engage/explain/elaborate, and (3)
   evaluate. In addition, a secondary analysis revealed the means and
   standard deviations of the students' performance on each of the phases
   of the 5E that include: engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and
   evaluate. The engage item held the highest mean rating, and the
   evaluation items had the lowest mean ratings. Examination of the
   instrument's structure in light of the 5E phases is discussed and
   provides directions for future revisions and research.},

Abstract = {The environmental agenda is gaining momentum as an international policy
   issue. This is reflected in an increase in environmental education
   research focussing on children's awareness and attitudes toward the
   environment. In this study, we focused on this issue from a school
   effectiveness perspective and evaluated (a) which student
   characteristics predict environmental attitudes and awareness, (b)
   whether schools make a difference in their students' environmental
   attitudes and awareness and (c) if school effects are different for
   students with varying levels of science ability. The cross-sectional
   Flemish data of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development's Programme for International Student Assessment 2006 (4,999
   students in 156 schools) were re-analysed using a multivariate
   multilevel model to address these issues. Results show that gender,
   immigrant status, socioeconomic status and educational track are
   important in explaining students' environmental attitudes and awareness.
   Furthermore, the results show that schools do matter; schools in which
   science is taught in a more hands-on manner are associated with higher
   student environmental awareness whilst environmental learning activities
   are associated with more pro-environmental attitudes amongst students.
   After controlling for student characteristics, these school effects do
   not differ between more science-literate children and their less or
   average science-literate peers.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results obtained from a study comparing the
   strategies used by 1,070 Chinese students and 1,002 Singaporean students
   from primary grade 6 to secondary year 2 in solving three
   fraction-related problems. It is part of the author's Ph.D. study, which
   involves more word problems on speed. The Chinese students performed
   better than the Singaporean students on two of the three problems, while
   the Singaporean students performed better than the Chinese students on
   the other. The strategy analyses reveal that the Chinese students used
   the traditional methods like arithmetic and algebraic strategies more
   frequently than the Singaporean students, whereas the Singaporean
   students used the model and unitary methods more frequently than the
   Chinese students. Implications for the teaching and learning of word
   problems on speed, as well as problem solving, are also provided.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the understanding of three key conceptual
   categories relating to the kinetic particle theory: (1) intermolecular
   spacing in solids, liquids and gases, (2) changes of state and
   intermolecular forces and (3) diffusion in liquids and gases, amongst
   148 high school students from Brunei, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore
   using 11 multiple-choice items that required students to provide
   explanations for their selection of particular responses to the items.
   Students' responses to the items revealed limited understanding of the
   particle theory concepts, with nine alternative conceptions held by more
   than 10\% of various samples of students. Also, 40.5-78.4\% of all
   students indicated consistent understanding relating to the three
   conceptual categories based on their responses to the 11 items. However,
   when their explanations were taken into account, very few students
   displayed consistent understanding of the related concepts.},

Title = {FROM ``EXPLORING THE MIDDLE ZONE{''} TO ``CONSTRUCTING A BRIDGE{''}:
   EXPERIMENTING IN THE SPIRAL <i>BIANSHI</i> MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The spiral bianshi curriculum, an improvement on bianshi teaching
   developed by Gu (2000) and in line with Marton's theory of variation
   (Marton \& Booth, 1997), was tried out in a primary school in Hong Kong.
   This improved theoretical framework for the spiral bianshi curriculum
   comprises four types of bianshi problems-the inductive bianshi, the
   broadening bianshi, the deepening bianshi, and the applicative bianshi.
   Based on this framework, the research team developed a set of teaching
   materials on the three topics of division of fraction, speed, and
   volume. The materials were tried out in 21 Primary 6 classes (a total of
   686 students) in a school. The effect was compared with a reference
   group using standard textbook materials in Hong Kong. A series of
   instruments, pre-tests, and post-tests were administered to gauge the
   effects on students' performance in solving routine and non-routine
   problems, as well as the affective outcomes including self-concept,
   attitude towards learning mathematics, approaches to learning, and
   conceptions of mathematics. The intervention effects of the experimental
   design were examined by hierarchical regression analysis. The research
   reveals that students using spiral bianshi teaching materials performed
   significantly better than their counterparts using standard textbook
   materials. However, no significant differences were identified among
   affective learning outcome variables despite the positive results on
   cognitive learning outcomes. The findings indicate that spiral bianshi
   curriculum has high potential in enhancing students' learning
   effectiveness. However, further studies are needed to map its strengths
   in detail.},

Abstract = {With the increasing importance of teaching STEM to young students, the
   engineering design process (EDP) has become a popular learning platform
   in K-12 STEM education. The engineering design process guides students
   in solving engineering problems, but there is a lack of understanding of
   how students utilize this process. In this study, we explored how
   iterative design activities form procedural patterns of the engineering
   design process using sequential analysis. We videotaped 48 engineering
   design sessions via the Concurrent Think-Aloud (CTA) protocol from
   elementary students grades 3-6 in the USA. The data was coded using
   Halfin's codes. The sequential analyses identified the statistical
   significance of patterns from the repetitive design activities. The
   results indicate (1) there were two iterative recursions in the problem
   and solution phases, (2) questioning was a gateway to designing, (3)
   modeling and predicting occurred with designing, and (4) managing
   bridged the problem and solution phases. The study also found that
   different design contexts yield distinctive procedural patterns. This
   result implies that engineering educators need to understand the proper
   use of the design process model.},

Abstract = {Recent research on teacher education has highlighted the importance of
   teachers' noticing of students' mathematical thinking. Much remains
   unknown about the ways in which teachers develop noticing abilities in
   professional development settings. This study examines changes in
   teachers' noticing in the context of peer discussions in a video club.
   The study identified critical incidents of noticing, ranging from
   attending and interpreting to deciding on pedagogical responses.
   Furthermore, the study divided attending in the noticing framework into
   selecting and recognizing. Findings indicate that peer discussions about
   a video showing students' statistical variability reasoning catalyzed
   change in teachers' attending. Other catalysts include (1) participants'
   assumption of the proposer role in the video club, (2) participants'
   peers as the coadjacent speakers, and (3) participants' use of an
   analytical framework as professional knowledge. The study discusses the
   ways in which participants' individual focal components of noticing
   emerge and develop through a video club as professional development.},

   to their success in their degrees. The article presents part of a larger
   qualitative study comprising individual interviews with faculty members.
   Data were analysed through an inductive system of categories and codes.
   The results show what the faculty did when they knew they had students
   with disabilities studying their subjects, how they valued their
   experiences with disability and what recommendations they would make to
   other colleagues regarding how to be more inclusive. The conclusions
   suggest that, in order to respond to diversity, faculty must be
   well-informed and well-trained, contact the disability office and plan
   the lectures in a proactive and accessible way, making reasonable
   adjustments. The experiences of these inclusive professionals can help
   other members of the university community to perceive disability as an
   opportunity to improve teaching practices, learn how to help their
   students with disabilities and design educational practices for all.},

Abstract = {Teacher noticing of student thinking represents a key aspect of teacher
   expertise as it informs teachers' actions `on the fly' during a lesson.
   In science and mathematics education, teacher noticing has been
   conceptualised as being driven by attending to and making sense of
   student thinking. A range of models of noticing developed in
   professional fields such as aviation posit that perceptual interaction
   is also a key driver of noticing. This paper presents an alternate,
   ecological model of teacher noticing that begins with the premise that
   teachers have limited capacity to make sense of noteworthy events
   mid-lesson. Multimodal data collected from a primary science and
   mathematics lesson, taught by the same teacher, is analysed using the
   ecological lens. The analysis draws research attention to aspects of
   teacher/classroom interaction such as attention deployment and the role
   that classroom environments play in facilitating mid-lesson noticing of
   student thinking. Differences in teacher noticing between the science
   and mathematics lesson can be accounted for in terms of variance in
   environmental structure rather than solely in terms of teacher
   cognition.},

Abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have drawn researchers' attention as
   a means of providing personalized learning content, adaptive feedback,
   and instructional strategies based on students' characteristics and
   learning needs. Few studies, however, have explored how prospective and
   practicing teachers integrate ITSs into their lessons. This study
   examines the relationships among prospective teachers' concerns about
   the ITSs, their positioning of an ITSs when planning a math lesson, and
   their technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK). The
   results indicate that the prospective teachers were intensively
   concerned with informational and personal aspects regarding ITSs and
   somewhat interested in modifying ITS-integrated teaching practices. The
   prospective teachers tended to assess themselves as having a high level
   of knowledge related to pedagogy but less knowledge about pedagogy and
   technology. Furthermore, the prospective teachers were more likely to
   position the ITSs as a servant than as a partner. When positioning the
   ITSs as a partner, they tended to plan their lessons based on
   in-the-moment student data provided by the ITS. In addition, the
   prospective teachers who positioned the ITS as a partner expressed more
   concern about modifying the ITSs and recognized that they had higher
   TPACK than those who positioned it as a servant.},

Abstract = {Representations constitute an important part of chemistry knowledge.
   This paper revisits the notion of the term, symbolic, in the chemistry
   triangle proposed by Johnstone using the theoretical lens of social
   semiotics. In doing so, this paper proposes a framework of chemistry
   learning that highlights representational re-description and
   coordination as key mechanisms for facilitating connections among the
   three domains of knowledge: chemical phenomenon (perceptual-experiential
   level), macroscopic (theoretical-descriptive level) and submicroscopic
   (theoretical-explanatory level). This paper illustrates how this
   framework can be used to explore student meaning making of changes of
   state by examining students' interactions with the phenomena of melting
   and boiling and with the multiple representations of the phases of
   matter introduced in the classroom. The findings revealed the
   opportunities and challenges which emerged from student meaning making
   with multiple representations in the process of developing an
   understanding of the submicroscopic view of phase change. It also
   highlighted the support needed to facilitate such meaning making through
   representational re-description and coordination in order for students
   to develop a deep understanding of the logical connections between the
   particular model and the macroscopic patterns of the observed phenomena.},

Abstract = {Network analysis is a topic in secondary mathematics education of
   growing importance because it offers students an opportunity to
   understand how to model and solve many authentic technology and
   engineering problems. However, very little is known about how students
   make sense of the algorithms typically used in network analysis. In this
   study, I used the Hungarian algorithm to explore how students make sense
   of a network algorithm and how it can be used to solve assignment
   problems. I report the results of a design-based research project in
   which eight Year 12 students participated in a teaching experiment that
   spanned four 60-min lessons. A hypothetical learning trajectory was
   developed in which students were introduced to the steps of the
   Hungarian algorithm incrementally. The results suggest that students
   made sense of the intermediate steps of the algorithm, the results of
   those steps, and how the algorithm works to solve assignment problems.
   The difficulties that students encountered are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Advocacy is an emergent dimension of teacher leadership, given its
   growing importance in shaping policy and facilitating reform efforts in
   American K-12 education. In 2014, the National Academies called for
   advancing advocacy-based activities and leadership among K-12 science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers, who are
   presently understudied. The purpose of this embedded single-case case
   study was to explore STEM teachers' development of self-efficacy in
   advocacy for STEM education. Contextualizing the case, participants
   consisted of 11 STEM teacher leaders who were part of the STEM Teacher
   Ambassadors (STA) program, a year-long advocacy-focused leadership
   development fellowship program, jointly sponsored by the National
   Science Teaching Association and National Council of Teachers of
   Mathematics. Employing case study research methodology, primary data
   were collected using semi-structured interviews, while secondary data
   were sourced via focus group interview and documents to triangulate
   interview data. Utterances (i.e., participant statements, groups of
   statements, or segments of statements) from transcribed data were coded
   a priori and analyzed via four constructs of self-efficacy theory:
   enactive master experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion,
   and emotional arousal. Results revealed 157 utterances coded to
   self-efficacy building within STEM education advocacy. Findings suggest
   that STEM teacher leaders' participation in professional development
   programs that specifically focus on development of policy knowledge and
   advocacy activities help to develop and sustain STEM teacher leaders'
   advocacy self-efficacy, given that participating teachers have numerous
   opportunities to fully engage in mastery experiences in STEM education
   advocacy. Implications and recommendations for policy and suggestions
   for further studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {Solving problems by different methods, identifying the knowledge put at
   stake in each case, and stating variants of the problems are fundamental
   aspects of the competence of analysis of mathematical knowledge for
   teaching. This paper reports on the design, implementation, and results
   of a formative intervention with primary education prospective teachers
   to promote developing this competence using tasks that involve
   proportional and algebraic reasoning. The experience has been carried
   out with a sample of 88 students (two class-groups), applying a didactic
   model that includes work in teams, institutionalization, and assessment
   of the individual learning achieved. Seventy three percent of students
   were successful in solving problems; however, only 27\% of students
   managed to solve the four problems proposed by at least two different
   procedures. More than half of the students adequately identified the
   knowledge involved in each problem and the algebraization level was
   correctly assigned in more than half of the proposed solutions.
   Elaborating meaningful variants to the problems was only achieved in a
   suitable way by less than 20\% of the students. It is concluded that
   developing the epistemic analysis competence of tasks bringing into play
   proportional and algebraic reasoning requires a greater attention in the
   teachers' formative programs.},

Abstract = {Interactions in multilingual science classrooms involve local cognitive
   and sociocultural dimensions along with global contextual aspects such
   as language-in-education policies. The intersection of these has
   implications for providing quality science education and supporting
   diverse students. This study investigates interactions in Lebanese
   multilingual science classrooms by using an integrative framework to
   analyze dialogicity oflocalclassroom practices, or the extent to which
   students' ideas are acknowledged and built upon for conceptual learning.
   Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) is then used to depict local
   practices within the largerglobalcontextual aspects. Data were collected
   through instrumental case studies of three middle school science
   teachers in schools of different socioeconomic levels. Data sources
   included: (a) videotaped science lessons, (b) teacher and school leader
   interviews, and (c) student group interviews. Data were then arranged
   into an activity system for each teacher's classroom. Each activity
   system showed how local interactions and practices were situated within
   contextual aspects and the emergent contradictions in each. We discuss
   what contradictions tell us about interactions in Lebanese multilingual
   science classrooms and how these can inform professional development in
   multilingual science education.},

Abstract = {The paper presents a study about pre-service science teachers'
   perceptions of the Nature of Science (NOS). Although there is a
   substantial amount of research on NOS in science teacher education,
   international comparative accounts particularly of in-depth qualitative
   data emerging from group discussions are fairly minimal. The primary aim
   of the research was to determine the changes of pre-service science
   teachers' NOS perceptions following group discussions in two different
   national contexts: Turkey and England. Two groups of pre-service
   teachers from Turkey were contrasted with two groups of pre-service
   teachers from England. The group discussions were structured with a set
   of steps. In the first step, the participants were asked to reflect
   about NOS and record their key ideas on sticky notes. Subsequently, they
   were presented with a visual framework of NOS, and they were asked to
   situate their own ideas from the sticky notes in this image. Verbal data
   from group discussions were investigated by qualitative methodology
   using thematic analysis. The findings suggest that both groups of
   pre-service teachers initially focused on epistemic-cognitive aspects of
   NOS but their ideas became more nuanced in providing some examples about
   social and institutional dimensions of NOS following the introduction of
   the NOS image. The study contributes to the understanding of how
   pre-service teachers view NOS and illustrates how NOS can potentially be
   incorporated into group discussions in science teacher education.},

Abstract = {In this study, we identify ways in which a sample of 18 graduates with
   mathematics-related first degrees found thenth term for quadratic
   sequences from the first values of a sequence of data, presented on a
   computer screen in various formats: tabular, scattered data pairs and
   sequential. Participants' approaches to identifying thenth term were
   recorded with eye-tracking technology. Our aims are to identify their
   strategies and to explore whether and how format influences these
   strategies. Qualitative analysis of eye-tracking data offers several
   strategies: Sequence of Differences, Building a Relationship, Known
   Formula, Linear Recursive and Initial Conjecture. Sequence of
   Differences was the most common strategy, but Building a Relationship
   was more likely to lead to the right formula. Building from Square and
   Factor Search were the most successful methods of Building a
   Relationship. Findings about the influence of format on the range of
   strategies were inconclusive but analysis indicated sporadic evidence of
   possible influences.},

Abstract = {Many Australian students from poor families decline to take advanced
   mathematics when they reach senior secondary school, resulting in an
   under-representation of disadvantaged student groups in the advanced
   mathematics streams. It is important to promote disadvantaged students'
   aspirations for advanced mathematics given the significance of this
   important subject for future academic and career opportunities. The
   current study followed a selected group of achieving mathematics
   students from low SES families (n = 30) for 3 years to understand what
   motivates them to learn mathematics and whether they aspire for advanced
   mathematics. Data collection activities spanned over 3 years beginning
   when the participating students were in year 8. The dataset includes
   student interviews in year 8 and year 9, students' survey responses in
   year 9, teachers' assessment of students' likelihood to take advanced
   mathematics, students' reported aspirations for advanced mathematics in
   year 8 and year 9, and their subject choice decisions in year 10. The
   findings showed that these students, notwithstanding economic
   disadvantage, were motivated to learn mathematics. Many aspired for
   advanced mathematics and held multiple reasons for learning mathematics.
   In contrast, those who did not intend to take advanced mathematics in
   senior secondary school learnt predominantly with performance
   considerations. The results are discussed in light of supporting
   students' mathematics aspirations from a motivational perspective.},

Abstract = {Supporting students' active participation in maker-centered
   project-based learning (PBL) can be challenging in inclusive classes.
   The aim of this study was to support students' active participation in
   cooperative team via teacher-directed reflective discussions during an
   inclusive, maker-centered PBL unit. The study was conducted during the
   students' final year of primary school. In the context of 44 students'
   inclusive class, the study focused on a team of 11 students (4 girls, 7
   boys; aged 12 - 13 years) who worked in pairs and had their own
   differentiated responsibility areas (e.g. interior designers had
   interior design and lighting responsibilities) in the construction of a
   scale-model house. Because students in PBL need support in their
   learning, reflective discussions were organized after each lesson to
   ensure students' participation. Reflective discussions were video
   recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a content and co-occurrence
   network analysis. The analysis revealed that teacher-directed reflective
   discussions first focused on supporting the cooperation of all students
   and then ensured the continuity of the process with most of the pairs.
   Some pairs, consisting of students with learning difficulties, needed
   intensified support until they could actively participate. The results
   indicate that teacher-directed reflective discussions improve students'
   cooperation skills and promote participation. A carefully prepared group
   composition enables the teacher to give intensified support to those
   students who need it most. In light of the results, we recommend that
   teachers focus on group composition when preparing inclusive,
   maker-centered PBL projects and use reflective discussions during said
   projects to promote inclusion and support students' active
   participation.},

Abstract = {The integration of socioscientific issues (SSI) into science teaching
   requires that teachers manage classroom discussions in which various
   perspectives are considered and students' contributions are recognized.
   The present study aimed to provide knowledge of how classroom
   discussions on SSI can be structured and implemented to pursue specific
   teaching purposes. In this study, two secondary science teachers'
   employment of communicative approaches during four discussions on SSI
   was analysed. In the studied context, communicative approaches can be
   described as involving various or only a single perspective on SSI and
   as being either interactive or non-interactive. The results elucidate
   how teachers can make purposeful use of different communicative
   approaches to facilitate students' decision-making while promoting
   complexity in their reasoning. The results also show how teachers can
   promote cumulativity, in terms of their recognition of students'
   contributions to discussions. It is proposed that teachers can use the
   concept of communicative approaches as an analytical tool to reflect on
   and develop aspects of teaching practice in relation to the goals that
   they wish to achieve.},

Abstract = {Recent reforms in science education have supported the inclusion of
   engineering in K-12 curricula. To this end, many science classrooms have
   incorporated engineering units that include design tasks. Design is an
   integral part of engineering and helps students think in creative and
   interdisciplinary ways. In this study, we examined middle-school
   students' naturally occurring design conversations in small design teams
   and their learning of science as a result of engaging in an engineering
   and science unit. We found that the proportion of different thought
   processes used by boys and girls was quite similar. Both girls and boys
   produced a higher percentage of ideas or thoughts associated with
   divergent thinking, but a lower proportion in convergent thinking,
   evaluative thinking, and cognitive memory. In addition, gender
   composition of design teams influenced thought processes expressed by
   girls and boys. Interestingly, in mixed teams, both girls and boys
   expressed less divergent thinking than those in single-sex teams. With
   regard to science content learning, both girls and boys showed
   statistically significant learning gains. There were no significant
   gender differences in the pre- and post-test scores. These results
   suggest that participating in an engineering design task in small design
   teams provided students opportunities to engage in productive thinking
   and enhance their learning of the targeted science concept-ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Through a questionnaire survey, this study aims to investigate the
   contributions of different sources in developing science teachers'
   practical knowledge of teaching with practical work. The framework of
   this study is based on the conceptualization of PCK and ten possible
   sources of science teachers' PCK related to teaching with practical
   work. The findings of this study can be summed in the following aspects.
   Firstly, among the ten possible sources, overall, the more important
   sources are personal teaching practices and reflection and informal
   exchanges with colleagues; the important sources are reading teaching
   materials, learning from online resources, and pre-service training
   experience, while the least important ones are in-service training
   experience and experience as primary and secondary school student.
   Secondly, for the five components of PCK of teaching with practical
   work, the contributions of the ten sources are different. Thirdly, three
   sources are found to be significantly different between teachers who
   have pre-service training experience and those who do not have. They are
   classroom observation (goals toward practical work), in-service training
   experience (laboratorial curriculum materials; instructional
   strategies), and reading professional journals (teaching assessment). In
   the last part of this paper, some explanations are provided for these
   findings and the limitation of this study is discussed.},

Title = {The Impact of Using Coherent Curriculum on Students' Understanding of

Abstract = {A coherent curriculum that clearly defines sets of ideas that build upon
   one another to meet desired learning goals can successfully support the
   development of meaningful understanding across time. This study explores
   the influence of a coherent curriculum as a systematic approach to
   aligning and sequencing specific ideas to support students in developing
   deeper knowledge of chemistry core ideas by comparing students in
   classrooms that used coherent instructional materials with those that
   used more traditional materials. We followed approximately 1225 middle
   school students from 6 schools in 4 different states over 4 time points,
   across 2 school years, and across 3 grade levels. 165 assessment items
   were used to measure student understanding along a learning progression,
   which provides a guide for how students may move toward more
   sophisticated understanding over time. Students' estimated ability
   parameters obtained from item response theory analysis were used to
   compare the achievement between the coherent and traditional curriculum
   groups. Hierarchical linear model analysis was employed to examine
   students' learning growth rates between different curriculum materials
   by grade and school. The results revealed that there are differences in
   the trends of learning between the coherent and traditional group by
   grade and school performance level. The coherent curriculum shows a
   promising effect on student learning, particularly in high- and
   middle-performing schools. However, there are limits to using coherent
   curriculum on a low-performing school. This study concluded with a
   discussion of challenges and promises for using coherent curriculum
   materials to support student learning.},

Title = {Insights and Teacher Perceptions Regarding Students' Conceptions as They

Abstract = {The successful transition from high school to tertiary chemistry studies
   relies on a student's ability to transfer prior understanding since many
   topics are extended during first year general chemistry. It was
   therefore of interest to investigate the perspectives of high school and
   tertiary teachers regarding which topics and concepts they perceived to
   be the most important and their views of student preparation. This study
   was paralleled by the refinement of a diagnostic concept instrument to
   explore chemistry preconceptions held by leaving high school students
   and incoming first year students across two institutions. This
   instrument has been shown to be valid, reliable, and consistent and has
   provided formative feedback to faculty and students in regard to
   alternate conceptions over several years. A mismatch was found between
   the perceptions of high school teachers regarding their students'
   preparation and commencing students' achievement on the instrument. The
   most important topic to high school teachers was how electron
   configuration relates to structure whereas for tertiary teaching
   faculty, it was the conservation of matter. The position and response of
   equilibrium to change was of lowest importance to both groups. Student
   misconceptions, attributable to different learning impediments, are
   considered and a series of recommendations is proposed to support
   chemistry teachers who practice each side of the secondary-tertiary
   transition.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the
   ORIGO Stepping Stones program in a large suburban school district in the
   Midwestern U.S.. The sample included 11 elementary schools that
   implemented the program during the 2013-2016 school years. Findings are
   presented from teacher surveys, classroom observations, and analysis of
   standardized student mathematics achievement scores on the Northwest
   Evaluation Association Measurement of Academic Progress (NWEA MAP).
   Using multilevel models, the program did not demonstrate a detectably
   larger effect on mathematics achievement than the comparison. Classroom
   observations and views of teachers that support program implementation
   were explored. In terms of fidelity of implementation, findings
   suggested that the program was delivered differently from how it was
   intended. With respect to researchers and policymakers, the approach
   used to evaluating mathematics program effectiveness is informative and
   could be used as part of larger accountability systems.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate how students' high school
   experience, math and science efficacy, and student, parent, and teacher
   expectations affect their plans for college major choice after
   controlling for students' gender, ethnicity, and parental variables.
   Over 1500 9th grade students participated in the study. Using logistic
   regressions, we found that males and students whose parents held degree
   from a U.S. college are more likely to consider STEM majors in college.
   Hispanic students were found less likely to consider STEM major in
   college compared their Asian counterparts. Students who completed more
   STEM PBL projects and attended STEM summer camps are more likely to
   consider STEM majors. Students with higher GPAs also indicated that they
   are more likely to study STEM majors in college. In addition, students
   with higher parent and teacher encouragement are more likely to consider
   selecting a STEM major after graduating from high school. Moreover,
   students who had higher math and science efficacy are also more likely
   to consider choosing a STEM major in college. Last but not least, we
   found that students' future career choice is also positively associated
   with their interests and goals they develop during high school years.
   Other findings and interaction effects with gender and ethnicity are
   also discussed in the paper. Overall, this study demonstrates that
   students' contemplations about STEM major selection in college is
   influenced by the complex interplay between the individual, environment,
   and behavior, three major components of social cognitive career theory.},

Abstract = {Self-efficacy beliefs play a major role in determining teachers' science
   teaching practices and have been a topic of great interest in the area
   of preservice science teacher education. This qualitative study
   investigated factors that influenced preservice elementary teachers'
   science teaching self-efficacy beliefs in a physical science content
   course. The primary data sources included Science Teaching Efficacy
   Belief Instrument-B (STEBI-B) responses, two semi-structured interviews,
   classroom observations, and artifacts. Analysis of STEBI-B data was used
   to select 18 participants with varying levels of self-efficacy beliefs:
   low, medium, and high. Four categories representing course-related
   factors contributing towards participants' science teaching
   self-efficacy beliefs were found: (1) enhanced science conceptual
   understandings, (2) active learning experiences, (3) teaching
   strategies, and (4) instructor as a role model. While some course
   elements such as hands-on learning experiences and inquiry-based
   teaching strategies seemed to impact all groups positively, the
   low-group participants were particularly benefited from the ways in
   which science concepts were presented and the pace at which learning
   progressed. One implication from this study is that science educators
   could include elements within science content courses to potentially
   support preservice teachers with varied initial levels of science
   teaching self-efficacy.},

Title = {Multimodal Representations in Senior Biology Assessments: A Case Study

Abstract = {This paper investigates the use of multimodal representations to assess
   biological understanding in the final senior secondary school public
   examination in New South Wales, Australia. The investigation emanates
   from a larger Australian study concerned with the impact of disciplinary
   and technological innovations on science pedagogy, particularly in
   molecular genetics where much knowledge is represented in modalities
   other than, or in conjunction with, language and traditional print-based
   texts and visuals. The availability of digital technologies and their
   affordances for the learning and teaching of senior high school Biology
   now makes it realistic for examiners to include multimodal
   representations in assessment tasks. A qualitative analysis of
   final-year Biology examination papers from 2001 to 2013 identified and
   classified the multimodal representations included in this written
   external examination. Findings indicate that despite the ready
   availability of multimodal, multimedia representations in classroom
   learning and curriculum materials, and evidence of students' engagement
   with ICT, the high-stakes examinations make little use of such
   resources. A consequence of this mismatch between curriculum outcomes
   and assessment tools is that students may be disadvantaged because their
   in-depth knowledge and understanding of biological concepts is not
   effectively demonstrated through traditional pen-and-paper tests. A move
   towards a range of alternative assessment formats is one way to ensure
   that assessment aligns with multimodal learning in the classroom.},

Abstract = {The aim of this 2-group study was to investigate the following question:
   Are there significant differences between scaffolded design-based
   learning controlled using 7 forms and teacher-directed instruction
   methods for the toy crane project on grade 7 students' posttest scores
   on the simple machines achievement test, attitude toward simple
   machines, and attitude toward creativity in simple machines after
   adjusting for their respective pretest scores and the prior semester
   science grades? The study group (N = 65) consisted of grade 7 students
   in public middle schools in Burdur, Turkey. There were significant
   treatment effects favoring the first method with large effect sizes on
   both achievement and creative attitude scores. Teaching topics about
   simple machines with the design-based method increased students'
   achievement and creative attitude without disadvantaging their attitude
   toward the topic as they constructed new knowledge through each step of
   the precise process.},

Abstract = {A 30-item questionnaire was designed to determine Omani science
   teachers' attitudes toward teaching science and whether or not these
   attitudes differ according to gender and teaching experiences of
   teachers. The questionnaire items were divided into 3 domains: classroom
   preparation, managing hands-on science, and development appropriateness.
   The questionnaire was administered to 139 randomly selected science
   teachers who teach science in grades 5-10. The sample consisted of 72
   male teachers and 67 female teachers, 57 teachers with teaching
   experience between 1 and 5 years and 82 teachers with teaching
   experience of 6 and more years. The sample was selected from 7 schools
   in 1 Educational Governorate in the Sultanate of Oman. The questionnaire
   reliability was calculated by an internal consistency method, using
   Cronbach's alpha, which gave the value of 0.73 for all the items. The
   findings indicated that science teachers' attitudes toward teaching
   science were positive. Furthermore, the results showed that there were
   statically significant differences in teachers' attitudes due to gender
   in favor of the female teachers and in teaching experience in favor of
   teachers with long experience. The study proposed some recommendations
   to improve the science teachers' attitude, especially male teachers
   towards science teaching. Paying more attention to in-service
   professional development programs, encouraging new teachers to attend
   some classes to observe experienced colleagues, and finally rewarding
   teachers morally, socially, and financially are some of these
   recommendations.},

Abstract = {A one-group quasi-experimental design and survey methodology were used
   to investigate the effect of virtual laboratory practices on preservice
   teachers' (N = 29) graphic comprehension and interpretation skills with
   different learning approaches. Pretest and posttest data were collected
   with the Test of Understanding Kinematic Graphs. The Learning Approaches
   Scale was administered to the preservice science teachers to determine
   if they used an in-depth, superficial, or strategic approach. These data
   were analyzed using non-parametric statistics. The effect of virtual
   laboratory practices on these preservice teachers' graphic comprehension
   and interpretation skills was evaluated, and a significant
   pretest-posttest gain for ``Selecting the graphic related to the
   explanation of movement{''} was found. Suggestions are made to address
   the effects of teaching models and technology-integrated learning
   environments on students' learning approach in science courses at
   different levels of education.},

Abstract = {Mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT), defined by Ball (Elementary
   Journal, 93, 373-397, 1993) as knowledge that is needed to teach
   mathematics, has been used as a framework by researchers to interrogate
   various aspects of teaching and learning mathematics. In this article,
   which draws from a larger study, we show how an in-depth analysis of MKT
   can illuminate what teachers know and need to learn. This study
   described here uses MKT theory (Ball, Thames \& Phelps, Journal of
   Teacher Education, 59(5), 389-407, 2008) to develop an assessment tool,
   the MKT proficiency status tool, to measure and describe teachers' MKT
   by proficiency status. The study explores Kenyan teachers'
   interpretations of secondary school students' unusual problem solving
   solutions from across five mathematics strands. In this article, we
   share findings from data collected using a MKT task questionnaire. Data
   were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interpreted against the
   MKT proficiency status tool continuum of fluent, partially fluent, and
   inadequate. The teacher was the unit of analysis. Findings from the
   study indicate that teachers' levels of fluency were not consistent
   either by mathematical strand or by assessed MKT component. A fluency
   rate of 9.1 \% for mathematical strands and 1.7 A, for MKT components
   was found. The overall description of MKT proficiency status for this
   study was found to be partially fluent. From this study, we argue that
   the MKT proficiency status tool details and illuminates teachers'
   professional development needs and enables an in-depth analysis of their
   MKT proficiency status.},

Abstract = {This paper presents some results of an investigation on the number sense
   of a group of pre-service secondary teachers from Spain. The objective
   of this research was to analyze students' use of strategies associated
   to number sense and compare them with those obtained in a previous study
   with pre-service primary teachers in Taiwan, ( Yang, Reys \& Reys,
   International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, 7, 383-403,
   2009). Pre-service secondary teachers showed lower success than
   pre-service primary teachers in a number sense test. Nevertheless, these
   last based their reasoning mainly on rules and algorithms, while
   pre-service secondary teachers used more strategies of number sense. In
   an attempt to delve into the low success shown by of Spanish pre-service
   secondary teachers, some students were interviewed. Those interviews
   showed that a deeper work on number sense in the training of these
   students is needed.},

Abstract = {The focus on professional noticing in mathematics education has recently
   gained increased interest as researchers work to understand how and what
   is noticed and how this translates into practice. Much of this work has
   focused on the professional noticing practices of inservice teachers and
   preservice teachers, with less attention focused on those educating
   teachers. This research explores how novice mathematics teacher
   educators professionally notice as they engage in teaching experiments
   and create models of student's mathematical thinking. Findings indicate
   the novice teacher educators are including some evaluative comments in
   their professional noticing practices but lack in-depth interpretive
   analysis about student thinking and rarely make connections between
   student's thinking and the broader principles of teaching and learning.
   These findings provide evidence for the importance of supporting teacher
   educators with developing their abilities to professionally notice.},

Abstract = {Data collection, organization, and analysis are indispensable means of
   seeking solutions during the process of inquiry. Representations (called
   inscriptions by some educators) including graphs, tables, photographs,
   and equations are powerful ways of arranging and displaying data in
   visual form. This study aims to analyze quantitatively the use of
   representations by Key Stage 2 (KS2) students in extra-curricular
   science inquiry projects. The reports from 145 science inquiry projects
   entries in a primary science exhibition in Hong Kong were studied. A
   total of 22 projects were awarded Outstanding; 46 were awarded Merit;
   and 77 were awarded Consolation by the exhibition judges using
   well-established scoring rubrics and procedures. The ability to use
   different types of representations and the representational practices
   were studied across the three award classes. Levels of abstraction and
   functionality (constructing, interpreting, reasoning, and presenting)
   were determined for the representation types and practices demonstrated
   in the reports. The findings indicate that the highest level projects
   (judged Outstanding) tended to exhibit a higher frequency and more
   diverse use of representations. In addition, the three award levels also
   displayed different patterns of representational practices.},

Abstract = {Homework (HW) is an integral part of the learning process. Currently,
   there is renewed interest and controversy about its effectiveness. The
   present study explores the voices of the science teachers on this
   matter. Adopting the view that reporting both teachers' views and actual
   classroom practices is necessary for obtaining a more complete view of
   the phenomena, the present study addressed teachers' views relating to
   the cognitive, affective, and pedagogical aspects of HW, their in-class
   practices and behaviors related to HW, and if the views and practices
   differ. The research was conducted in 3 stages: (a) teachers' (n = 25)
   behaviors were examined based on classroom observations of 3 - 5
   consecutive lessons, (b) these teachers were interviewed about their
   beliefs about and attitudes toward HW, and (c) the data from both the
   observations and interviews were processed into categories and
   subcategories. The findings revealed a wide range of teachers' beliefs,
   attitudes, and behaviors and that teachers hold both positive and
   negative views simultaneously. In addition, the views for some
   categories expressed in the interviews concurred with the teacher's
   actual classroom behavior; for other categories, disagreements were
   identified. This research broadens the contemporary horizons regarding
   HW and may contribute to those who wish to work with teachers making HW
   more effective.},

Abstract = {The professional development of mathematics teachers needs to support
   teachers in orchestrating the mathematics classroom in ways that enable
   them to respond flexibly and productively to the unexpected. When a
   situation arises in the classroom which is not connected in an obvious
   way to the mathematical learning intentions of the lesson, it can be
   challenging for the teacher to improvise so as to craft this situation
   into an opportunity for doing and learning mathematics. In this study,
   as teacher-researcher I maintained a record of unexpected situations as
   they arose in my own secondary mathematics classroom. Details are given
   of four unexpected situations which I found ways to exploit
   mathematically, and these are analysed to highlight factors which may
   enhance a mathematics teacher's preparedness for dealing with the
   unexpected. The results of this study indicate that deviating from the
   intended lesson to exploit an unexpected situation in which students
   have shown some interest can lead them into enjoyable and worthwhile
   mathematical engagement.},

Abstract = {School visits and field trips to museums and science centres are
   considered a powerful learning resource given their recreational and
   educational potential, but visits need to be integrated into classroom
   programming to optimize learning. In this study, we have attempted to
   design and build bridges between what a school needs and what a museum
   can offer, to ensure that future teachers acquire teaching skills that
   allow them to prepare a visit focused on learning. To that end, we make
   a `proposal for pre-service teacher training' consisting of designing
   and implementing a teaching unit cantered on a visit to the science
   centre. The study aims to assess how students' conceptions evolved with
   regard to the particular topic, using a pre- and post-test methodology,
   supported by qualitative analysis in the final reports. Although the
   results were limited to a single experiment, they provide evidence of an
   improvement in the methodological knowledge of teacher trainees
   regarding school visits to museums, although several aspects were
   identified to be worked on.},

Abstract = {Box plots are frequently misinterpreted and educational attempts to
   correct these misinterpretations have not been successful. In this
   study, we used two instructional techniques that seemed powerful to
   change the misinterpretation of the area of the box in box plots, both
   separately and in combination, leading to three experimental conditions,
   next to a control condition. First, we used multiple external
   representations: Histograms were used as an overlay on box plots in
   order to give students a better insight in the way box plots represent
   data distributions. Second, we used refutational text to explicitly name
   and invalidate the area misinterpretation of box plots. Third, we
   combined multiple external representations and refutational text. A box
   plot test showed that students in the refutation and combination
   condition scored statistically significant better than students in the
   control condition with respect to the misinterpretation of interest. The
   condition with multiple external representations scored in between. The
   implications of these results for theory and educational practice are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The classroom practices of science teachers are indicative of their
   beliefs and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). PCK is an amalgam of
   knowledge about subject matter, pedagogy, and contextual issues. This
   article identifies areas where physics teachers in Lesotho may need
   professional development support by addressing the research question:
   How do secondary school physics teachers in Lesotho describe the
   teaching of science and their actual practice? A mixed-methods approach
   involving a survey and follow-up interviews of secondary school physics
   teachers was used to collect information about this research question.
   The results show that there is a disjuncture between the teachers'
   pedagogic knowledge and the teachers' contextual knowledge, indicating
   that their PCK was not well formed and could serve as a central focus
   for their professional development.},

Abstract = {The lack of females entering STEM careers is well documented. Reasons
   for the gender gaps at all stages of the educational pipeline include
   both internal factors such as self-concept and external factors such as
   the influence of parents, media, and educators. Using latent growth
   curve analysis and nationally representative longitudinal survey data,
   this study compares differences in the relationship between a critical
   external factor (perceived early parental support), student mathematics
   and science achievement trajectories, and persistence in STEM career by
   gender. Mathematics and science trajectories were positively related to
   STEM career persistence for males and females. Perceived early parental
   support was related to growth in mathematics achievement for males but
   not females. There was no relationship between early perceived parental
   support and growth in science achievement for either males or females.
   These findings indicate differences in the relationship between parental
   support, achievement, and career persistence depending on content area
   and gender.},

Abstract = {Finding out about and then understanding the forces acting on a moving
   object, based on a description of the change in motion of this object,
   is an important part of the conceptual understanding of Newton's law of
   motion. Using Hempel's deductive-normative model for scientific
   explanation, we developed a deductive explanation task (DET), and we
   applied this task in teaching students to improve their knowledge about
   force and motion. The results showed that many students received
   benefits and reached a good conceptual understanding by using the DET.
   Also, many students responded that learning physics through deductive
   thinking was less difficult, and in fact, this method of learning was
   even interesting. Based on the research results, we present some
   recommendations and suggestions for further study for more effective
   physics teaching.},

Abstract = {This study explores the effects of the presence of external
   representations of a mathematical object (ERs) on problem solving
   performance associated with short double-choice problems. The problems
   were borrowed from secondary school algebra and geometry, and the ERs
   were either formulas, graphs of functions, or drawings of geometric
   figures. Performance was evaluated according to the reaction time (RT)
   required for solving the problem and the accuracy of the answer. Thirty
   high school students studying at high and regular levels of instruction
   in mathematics (HL and RL) were asked to solve half of the problems with
   ERs and half of the problems without ERs. Each task was solved by half
   of the students with ERs and by half of the students without ERs. We
   found main effects of the representation mode with particular effect on
   the RT and the main effects of the level of mathematical instruction and
   mathematical subject with particular influence on the accuracy of
   students' responses. We explain our findings using the cognitive load
   theory and hypothesize that these findings are associated with the
   different cognitive processes related to geometry and algebra.},

Abstract = {This paper considers studying changes in teachers' perspectives
   regarding the teaching of mathematically talented students learning in
   heterogeneous classes. We investigate these changes through a case study
   of Rona, a teacher who participated in the professional development
   program ``From One End to the Other{''} held in The David Yellin College
   of Education, Israel. The analysis focuses on 3 categories of change:
   awareness, practice, and self-efficacy. The results concerning Rona, 1
   of the participants, demonstrate a rise in awareness of talented
   students, a change in the ways of meeting the needs of these students,
   and a rise in self-efficacy regarding the teaching of talented students.
   Moreover, it was found that changes in 1 category are interwoven with
   changes in the other categories.},

Title = {EXPLORING TEACHERS' KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTIONS ACROSS MATHEMATICS AND

Abstract = {This paper examines upper elementary and middle school teachers'
   learning of mathematics and science content, how their perceptions of
   their disciplines and learning of that discipline developed through
   content-rich learning experiences, and the differences and commonalities
   of the teachers' learning experiences relative to content domain. This
   work was situated within a larger professional development (PD) program
   that had multiple, long-term components. Participants' growth occurred
   in 4 primary areas: knowledge of content, perceptions of the discipline,
   perceptions about the learning of the discipline, and perceptions
   regarding how students learn content. Findings suggest that when
   embedded within an effective professional development context, content
   can be a critical vehicle through which change can be made in teachers'
   understandings and perceptions of mathematics and science. When
   participants in our study were able to move beyond their internal
   conflicts and misunderstandings, they could expand their knowledge and
   perceptions of content and finally bridge to re-conceptualize how to
   teach that content. These findings further indicate that although
   teachers involved in both mathematics and science can benefit from
   similar overall PD structures, there are some unique challenges that
   need to be addressed for each particular discipline group. This study
   contributes to what we understand about teacher learning and change, as
   well as commonalities and differences between teachers' learning of
   mathematics and science.},

Abstract = {The tacit messages transmitted to indigenous learners in the science
   classroom provide a lens through which indigenous disengagement with
   school science can be better understood. In this paper, the findings of
   a cross-national comparative study conducted with indigenous Maori
   students in New Zealand and Seediq/Atayal students in Taiwan are
   discussed from a sociological perspective. The purposes of the present
   study were to explore the ways in which indigenous elementary school
   students in two industrialized nations experience the science curriculum
   and to identify the socialization processes through which patterns of
   indigenous under-achievement in science are maintained and reproduced.
   The findings suggest that the peripheral positioning of indigenous
   culture and knowledge within the science curriculum in developed nations
   underpins a series of tacit pedagogical codes that contribute to
   indigenous student disengagement with the subject.},

Abstract = {This study gives an insight into the differences between student
   understanding of line graph slope in the context of physics (kinematics)
   and mathematics. Two pairs of parallel physics and mathematics questions
   that involved estimation and interpretation of line graph slope were
   constructed and administered to 114 Croatian second year high school
   students (aged 15 to 16 years). Each pair of questions referred to the
   same skill in different contexts-one question in the context of
   mathematics and the other in the context of kinematics. A sample of
   Croatian physics teachers (N = 90) was asked to rank the questions
   according to their expected difficulty for second year high school
   students. The prevalent ranking order suggests that most physics
   teachers expected mathematics questions to be more difficult for
   students than the parallel physics questions. Contrary to the prevalent
   teachers' expectations, students succeeded better on mathematics than on
   physics questions. The analysis of student answers and explanations
   suggests that the lack of mathematical knowledge is not the main reason
   for student difficulties with graphs in kinematics. It appears that the
   interpretation of the meaning of line graph slope in a physics context
   presents the largest problem for students. However, students also showed
   problems with the understanding of the concept of slope in a
   mathematical context. Students exhibited slope/height confusion in both
   contexts, but much more frequently in the context of physics than in the
   context of mathematics.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of students'
   motivational beliefs (learning goal orientation, task value and
   self-efficacy) in science learning on students' self-regulation in the
   science classroom. The study also examines the moderating effect of
   gender on the proposed relationships. Data were collected from 719 boys
   and 641 girls across grades 8, 9 and 10 in 5 public schools in Perth,
   Western Australia. Results from structural equation modeling analysis
   indicated that all 3 motivational constructs were strong predictors of
   students' self-regulation in science learning. The multi-group analysis
   to examine gender differences revealed that the influence of task value
   on self-regulation was statistically significant for boys only. The
   findings present possible opportunities for educators to plan, and to
   put into practice, effective intervention strategies aimed at increasing
   students' self-regulation in science learning. The core feature would be
   to target and develop students' motivational beliefs of learning goal
   orientation and self-efficacy in science learning. Additionally, for
   boys, the intervention strategies would be to elevate boys' perspectives
   of science task value.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigate the meaning students attribute to the
   structure of mathematical induction (MI) and the process of proof
   construction using mathematical induction in the context of a geometric
   recursion problem. Two hundred and thirteen 17-year-old students of an
   upper secondary school in Greece participated in the study. Students'
   responses in 3 written tasks and the interviews with 18 of them are
   analyzed. Though MI is treated operationally in school, the students,
   when challenged, started to recognize the structural characteristics of
   MI. In the case of proof construction, we identified 2 types of
   transition from argumentation to proof, interwoven in the structure of
   the geometrical pattern. In the first type, MI was applied to the
   algebraic statement that derived from the direct translation of the
   geometrical situation. In the second type, MI was embedded functionally
   in the geometrical structure of the pattern.},

Abstract = {Given the large investment in teacher professional development (PD),
   further understanding of the factors that impact PD success is needed.
   In a previous study, the authors established a framework for
   categorizing PD projects using the notion of orientations. A PD
   orientation is comprised of project characteristics that drive the PD
   design and implementation for that project. In this study, we applied
   this orientation framework to 14 science and mathematics PD projects and
   examined the relationship between projects of differing orientations and
   PD outcomes (e.g. perceived improvement in teaching practices). The
   results provide support for the value of the framework and demonstrate
   that PD projects with different orientations exhibit differing
   participant outcomes. This study also provides evidence of the value of
   this research framework for understanding how PD implementation
   characteristics are related to PD outcomes, as well as points to the
   value of a ``balanced{''} orientation where both content and pedagogy
   are addressed in equal parts.},

Abstract = {The way in which students view science and its practitioners,
   particularly during their late elementary and early secondary grade
   levels, has been at the core of numerous studies dating back to research
   by Mead \& Metraux (Science 126:384-390, 1957). In this study, we used
   the Draw-a-Scientist Test Checklist developed by Finson, Beaver \&
   Cramond (Sch Sci Math 95(4):195-205, 1995) to explore and document
   Colombian and Bolivian students' perceptions of scientists. Despite the
   wealth of information from years of study, there is a lack of research
   on images held by students in Latin American nations. This study
   involved Colombian and Bolivian students (N = 1,017) in 5th to 11th
   grades and was aimed at providing an original account of how these
   students picture scientists and science. Results suggest differences on
   how students perceive scientists based on nationality, grade and school
   type. We discuss how features may be associated with educational and
   socioeconomic status in each school community.},

Abstract = {The recruitment and training of scientists is an area of international
   concern. Much of the research and policy focus around this issue in the
   UK has been on how science is taught in schools and in particular on the
   structure of the school science curriculum. Much less attention has been
   devoted to the undergraduate student experience and the trajectory that
   learners take which can lead to higher education and into careers as
   professional scientists and technicians. This paper reports the findings
   from a comparative study of the experiences and aspirations of almost
   1,000 art and science undergraduates studying at 6 elite British
   universities. There is no evidence to suggest that undergraduate
   scientists are put off a career in the science, technology, engineering
   and mathematics field, although theirs is arguably a less positive
   experience than that of their peers who study arts subjects. Most
   science undergraduates have clear career aspirations which are largely
   linked to remaining in the field and often involve further study. For
   many, these aspirations lead them towards the applied sciences and away
   from a career in `pure' research or academia.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the nature and source of mathematics homework and
   teachers' and students' perspectives about the role of mathematics
   homework. The subjects of the study are three grade 8 mathematics
   teachers and 115 of their students. Data from field notes, teacher
   interviews and student questionnaire are analysed using qualitative
   methods. The findings show that all 3 teachers gave their students
   homework for instructional purposes to engage them in consolidating what
   they were taught in class as well as prepare them for upcoming tests and
   examinations. The homework only involved paper and pencil, was
   compulsory, homogenous for the whole class and meant for individual
   work. The main source of homework assignments was the textbook that the
   students used for the study of mathematics at school. `Practice makes
   perfect' appeared to be the underlying belief of all 3 teachers when
   rationalising why they gave their students homework. From the
   perspective of the teachers, the role of homework was mainly to hone
   skills and comprehend concepts, extend their `seatwork into out of class
   time' and cultivate a sense of responsibility. From the perspectives of
   the students, homework served 6 functions, namely improving/enhancing
   understanding of mathematics concepts, revising/practising the topic
   taught, improving problem-solving skills, preparing for
   test/examination, assessing understanding/learning from mistakes and
   extending mathematical knowledge.},

Abstract = {The German education system does not traditionally rely on standardized
   testing. However, when the Programme for International Student
   Assessment (PISA) study revealed an average performance of German
   students compared to other participating countries, a particular
   proportion of low-performing students, and remarkable disparities
   between the federal states, German policy makers decided for a major
   reform of the education system. A core piece of this reform was the
   introduction of National Education Standards. For science education,
   these standards were heavily influenced by the PISA results and its
   underlying framework. That is, with the standards, a paradigm shift took
   place from the German notion of Bildung towards the Anglo-American
   notion of literacy. With the introduction of these standards, a new
   field of empirical educational research was created: research on models
   of scientific literacy or competency models as a basis of benchmarking
   the standards. This article describes the German education system before
   PISA, summarizes the major findings from PISA, and describes how these
   findings informed the formulation of the performance standards for
   science education. It also details the measures undertaken to benchmark
   these standards. Finally, it provides insight into the issues with
   developing and benchmarking performance standards and points out future
   areas of research on evidence-based decision making in educational
   policy.},

Abstract = {We used four different methods to determine the best means of assessing
   over 200 preservice elementary teachers' growth in knowledge of models
   and their use in K-8 classrooms while participating in the Science
   Capstone course that focused on the unifying themes of models in
   science. Each assessment method probed a different aspect of models
   (from growth in scientific use to need for greater emphasis on the role
   and use of models) and each used a different method of gathering student
   responses (Likert-type responses to concept maps). We determined that
   growth in student knowledge was demonstrated by all instruments, but
   some instruments were more useful than others for determining preservice
   elementary teachers' prior knowledge as well as growth in knowledge of
   models necessary for K-8 teachers.},

Abstract = {Teaching and testing in science in junior secondary schools in Botswana,
   takes place in English which is a second language for the majority of
   Batswana (Citizens of Botswana are called Batswana {[}sing. Motswana]
   and the national language is Setswana.) students and a third language
   for many. The understanding of textual material in science has been
   shown to be problematic for first language speakers, which means that
   difficulties in comprehension are likely to be even greater for second
   language readers. This study set out to test the hypothesis that
   improving the readability of junior certificate science examination
   questions would improve student achievement. Results show that changing
   certain readability factors, such as sentence length, simplified
   vocabulary and the removal of obscure information, brought about an
   improvement in achievement. The conclusion considers the implications of
   the study for the writers of examinations and other texts in science.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the approaches to teaching by three fifth-grade
   teachers' of creative and non-creative mathematical problems for
   fractions. The teachers' personal constructs of the two kinds of
   problems were elicited by interviews through the use of the repertory

   Results revealed that the teachers had slightly distinctive constructs
   of creative and non-creative problems, and professed a greater
   preference for creative problems. Based on the teachers' creations of
   problems in classrooms and related features, the study identified three
   types of teaching approaches: liberal, reasoning, and skill approaches.
   The liberal approach appeared to indicate the most appropriate teaching
   methods for creative problems.},

Title = {A Review of Analytic Frameworks for Noticing in Mathematics and Science:
   Comparing Noticing Frameworks Across Disciplines and over Time},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 20},
Abstract = {We review analytic frameworks related to the study of noticing in
   mathematics and science education for the purpose of suggesting trends
   in research literature across both disciplines over time. We focus on
   highly cited articles in both mathematics and science noticing research,
   along with recent articles in both disciplines. We focus specifically on
   research articles that include an analytic framework, to understand the
   state of how data on noticing are analyzed. We conducted an extensive
   review of literature, intentionally related to population, temporality,
   methodology, and quality. The purpose was to provide an overview of the
   field of noticing, based on particular search criteria for articles
   including an analytic framework. To be considered an analytic framework,
   the article had to include a framework that could be used to analyze
   teacher noticing. We found frameworks in science education are
   frequently adapted from mathematics education and are moving toward
   pairing noticing with aspects of effective instruction (formative
   assessment, sense-making, pedagogical content knowledge), whereas the
   frameworks in mathematics education now consider context and equity,
   which was not an explicit focus in the initial noticing literature.},

Title = {Pattern-Recognition Processes of First-Grade Students: An Explorative
   Eye-Tracking Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 25},
Abstract = {Recognizing patterns is an essential skill in early mathematics
   education. However, first graders often have difficulties with tasks
   such as extending patterns of the form ABCABC. Studies show that this
   pattern-recognition ability is a good predictor of later pre-algebraic
   skills and mathematical achievement in general, or the development of
   mathematical difficulties on the other hand. To be able to foster
   children's pattern-recognition ability, it is crucial to investigate and
   understand their pattern-recognition processes early on. However, only a
   few studies have investigated the processes used to recognize patterns
   and how these processes are adapted to different patterns. These studies
   used external observations or relied on children's self-reports, yet
   young students often lack the ability to properly report their
   strategies. This paper presents the results of an empirical study using
   eye-tracking technology to investigate the pattern-recognition processes
   of 22 first-grade students. In particular, we investigated students with
   and without the risk of developing mathematical difficulties. The
   analyses of the students' eye movements reveal that the students used
   four different processes to recognize patterns-a finding that refines
   knowledge about pattern-recognition processes from previous research. In
   addition, we found that for patterns with different units of repeat
   (i.e. ABABAB versus ABCABCABC), the pattern-recognition processes used
   differed significantly for students at risk of developing mathematical
   difficulties but not for students without such risk. Our study
   contributes to a better understanding of the pattern-recognition
   processes of first-grade students, laying the foundation for enhanced,
   targeted support, especially for students at risk of developing
   mathematical difficulties.},

Title = {Challenging Greek Primary Students' Knowledge of Ocean Acidification
   Using the Carbon Cycle Context},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Month = {2023 NOV 21},
Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of an
   intervention on primary school students' construction of knowledge on
   ocean acidification and the development of their systems thinking.
   Eighty-five 11 to 12-year-old students from five different classes of
   two public primary schools in Greece participated in the 8-h
   intervention. The intervention included inquiry-based and
   knowledge-integration activities, and students worked in groups during
   all activities. Rich pictures, made by the groups at the beginning and
   the end of the intervention, were used to evaluate their progress in
   their knowledge concerning the carbon cycle, as well as in their systems
   thinking. Our findings showed that the intervention contributed to
   primary students' conceptual knowledge of the carbon cycle and the
   inclusion of ocean acidification in the carbon cycle. It also helped
   them improve their systems thinking, indicating that students' systems
   thinking at this age could be developed through formal instruction with
   interventions which emphasize content knowledge and use an earth systems
   approach. Moreover, our findings indicate that the systems thinking
   perspective can serve as an effective approach to help children better
   understand and critically engage with complex environmental issues, such
   as ocean acidification.},

Abstract = {Many science students struggle with using scientific language and making
   sense of scientific phenomena. Thus, there is an increased interest in
   science education research and public policy with regard to
   understanding and promoting scientific language use and sensemaking in
   science classrooms. However, there is a lack of comparative studies on
   how upper-secondary school students of different achievement and
   language levels use scientific language to make sense of phenomena. The
   aim of this study was to explore the relationship between achievement
   level, scientific language use, and sensemaking in chemistry for
   students being set a sensemaking task while constructing concept maps on
   the topic of chemical equilibrium. The concept maps were collected from
   five different upper-secondary schools in Sweden from two school systems
   (Swedish and International Baccalaureate). Using content analysis, these
   concept maps were examined for scientific language use as well as
   structuring of sensemaking. A majority of the students had difficulty
   structuring sensemaking in their concept maps, independently of
   achievement level. These difficulties included unstructured reasoning,
   symbolic representations being used as explanations, surface-level
   learning, and linear reasoning connected to rote learning. There
   appeared to be a connection between learning context and student
   individual structuring of sensemaking as expressed in the concept maps.
   The results also showed a clear relationship between scientific language
   use and achievement level in the student sample. The results indicate
   that the structuring of sensemaking and scientific language use are not
   always connected processes. In conclusion, teachers may need to adopt a
   teaching practice that includes directed and differentiated support for
   scientific sensemaking.},

Title = {The Use of the Constructivist Teaching Sequence (CTS) to Facilitate
   Changes in the Visual Representations of Fifth-Grade Elementary School
   Students: A Case Study on Teaching Heat Convection Concepts},

Abstract = {Most primary school students, although they grasp the scientific
   concepts of heat convection at the macroscopic level, commonly fail to
   visualize those concepts. Therefore, our research aims to enact a
   constructivist teaching sequence (CTS) to restructure students'
   visualization changes, ultimately enabling them to synergize macroscopic
   and sub-microscopic levels of understanding and visual representation.
   This study has employed a case study, combining qualitative and
   quantitative data to obtain an in-depth explanation. The quantitative
   data represent the percentage of the students' visual representation
   category and their understanding of pattern changes before and after the
   intervention. Meanwhile, the ways students presented their thoughts
   about a concept based on their visual representation are presented via
   qualitative data. All data come from the participants, comprising 69
   fifth-grade elementary school students at one public school in
   Indonesia. Our research findings show that students' understanding of
   heat convection at both macroscopic and sub-microscopic levels improved
   to scientific conception, after undertaking the learning process using
   CTS. In addition, the use of CTS fostered a level of visual
   representation change regarding ``construction{''} that dominated
   compared with other approaches: students shifted their visual
   representations from the varying styles of undefined drawing (UD),
   non-microscopic drawing (NMD), or no drawing (ND), to partial drawing
   (PD) and scientific drawing (SD).},

Title = {Exploring the Relationship Between Surface Features and Explaining
   Quality of YouTube Explanatory Videos},

Abstract = {Physics education research on explanatory videos has experienced a boost
   in recent years. Due to the vast number of explanatory videos available
   online, e.g. on YouTube, finding videos of high explaining quality is a
   challenging task for learners, teachers, and lecturers alike. Prior
   research on the explaining quality of explanatory videos on classical
   mechanics topics has uncovered that the surface features provided by
   YouTube (e.g. number of views or likes) do not seem to be suitable
   indicators of the videos' explaining quality. Instead, the number of
   content-related comments was found to be statistically significantly
   correlated with the explaining quality. To date, these findings have
   only been observed in the context of explanatory videos on classical
   mechanics topics. The question arises whether similar correlations
   between the explaining quality and YouTube surface features can be found
   for videos on topics that are difficult to access visually and verbally,
   for example from quantum physics. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory
   study analyzing the explaining quality of N = 60 YouTube videos on
   quantum entanglement and tunnelling. To this end, we made use of a
   category-based measure of explanatory videos' explaining quality from
   the literature. We report correlations between the videos' explaining
   quality and the surface features provided by YouTube. On the one hand,
   our results substantiate earlier findings for mechanics topics. On other
   hand, partial correlations shed new light on the relationship between
   YouTube's surface features and explaining quality of explanatory videos.},

Abstract = {Covariational reasoning (or the coordination of two dynamically changing
   quantities) is central to secondary STEM subjects, but research has yet
   to fully explore its applicability to elementary and middle-grade levels
   within various STEM fields. To address this need, we selected a globally
   referenced STEM assessment-the Trends in International Mathematics and
   Science Study (TIMSS)-to investigate the extent to which covariational
   reasoning could be applied. Specifically, we identified the frequency of
   items with potential to elicit students' covariational reasoning through
   a content analysis of publicly released TIMSS 2011 items in Grades 4 and
   8 mathematics and science. We found that approximately one-third of
   items in all grades and subjects had potential for covariational
   reasoning, and many of these items had such potential with no viable
   alternative strategy. Furthermore, items in every content strand and
   cognitive domain had potential for covariational reasoning. We interpret
   these findings as indicative of the salience of covariational reasoning
   across STEM education, and we discuss the implications of these results
   for research, assessment, and instruction.},

Abstract = {The work of teaching includes many in-the-moment decisions for teachers
   to make. In this study, we focused on the decisions prospective teachers
   made within the elementary context specific to shared teaching practice
   in mathematics and science instruction - elicit and use evidence of
   student thinking. Within a qualitative multisite case study, we analyzed
   data for how PTs took up student thinking within instructional
   decisions, and the nature of responsive moves enacted within an animated
   context once student thinking had been elicited. Findings reveal PTs
   were responsive to elicited student thinking. Most commonly, PTs'
   instructional decisions involved asking additional questions or inviting
   students to test their ideas. However, PTs' pedagogical moves varied
   across mathematics and science disciplines. Our findings guide teacher
   educators to focus on what moves best support PTs' development to use
   evidence of student thinking across disciplines in the elementary
   classroom. The consistency of asking questions within mathematics and
   science begins to inform the quest for shared core practices. Results
   highlight the benefit of using technology (i.e. animations) as a tool to
   support PTs' learning of instructional decisions and pedagogical moves
   to uncover the nuances of the teaching practice elicit and use evidence
   of student thinking.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the results of a quasi-experimental study that
   evaluated the effectiveness of collaborative mind mapping in three Hong
   Kong primary schools. More than 200 grade 4 students, divided into three
   pedagogical groups, participated in a variety of science learning
   activities with the aid of a mind map and/or collaborative group work.
   The results of diagnostic tests reveal the synergy of peer collaboration
   and mind mapping to be more effective than either collaboration or mind
   mapping alone in enhancing students' scientific achievement. Analysis of
   the students' science discourse and follow-up interviews indicates that
   collaborative mind mapping fosters learning motivation and facilitates
   the joint construction of conceptual knowledge in science.
   Recommendations are made for the integrative use of graphic organisers
   and group work, and implications for future research on science teaching
   in Hong Kong and elsewhere are further discussed.},

Abstract = {Retrieving information from memory can-under many
   circumstances-strengthen one's memory of the retrieved information
   itself. The strategic use of retrieval to enhance memory and help
   long-term retention is known as retrieval practice. However, it is
   unclear whether its effect also holds true in the case of learning
   mathematics. This research is an exploratory case study, where we test a
   method- using test-enhanced learning as formative assessment-in a
   high-needs vocational school. Since the literature on how this method
   works in classroom settings in mathematics is limited, the purpose of
   our case study was to get a better view and to lay the groundwork for
   further experiments. The experimental group and one of the control
   groups were from the vocational school, while the other control group
   was from an elite grammar school. On the final test members of the
   experimental group outscored their schoolmates and reached statistically
   the same scores as the control group from the elite grammar school. By
   means of the method, we were able to reduce the performance gap in
   long-term retention between students from the elite grammar school and
   students from the urban high-needs school.},

Title = {Development and Application of a Three-Tier Diagnostic Test to Assess
   Pre-service Science Teachers' Understanding on Work-Power and Energy

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to develop and validate a
   three-tier diagnostic test on work, power, and energy (WPE) concepts and
   (2) to identify Turkish pre-service science teachers' conceptual
   understanding through this test. The Work, Power, and Energy Concept
   Test (WPECT) was developed through interviews, read-aloud sessions, and
   two pilot tests. Construct, content, and face validity of WPECT was
   achieved by various statistical procedures and expert opinions. The
   final version was administered to 709 pre-service science teachers
   (79.43\% female, 20.57\% male) from nine different universities which
   are located in seven official geographical regions of Turkey. The
   Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of the test was estimated as .73.
   The analysis of the responses revealed that the majority of the
   participants showed an inadequate scientific understanding of WPE
   concepts. Four common alternative conceptions were held by more than
   10\% of the participants. These are as follows: (1) Constant pulleys
   produce a gain in energy and a corresponding gain in work; (2) The total
   amount of potential energy always transforms into the kinetic energy
   including frictional environments; (3) An object's total energy does not
   change when it is moved by a force; (4) A less muscular person moving
   the same object to the same distance at the same time delivers more
   power because s/he uses more energy. The results also presented that
   WPECT is a valid and reliable instrument to assess pre-service science
   teachers' alternative conceptions on WPE.},

Abstract = {Despite their high performance in STEM disciplines and earning top
   grades in math and science classes, many academically talented girls
   often leave STEM majors or shy away from careers in STEM. Understanding
   why bright and talented girls leave STEM majors requires an in-depth
   understanding of the factors that predict their success and retention in
   STEM. This study, conducted in Post-Soviet Kazakhstan, a country with a
   strong emphasis on the nation's talented students and STEM-focused
   education, provides evidence on the underlying reasons for this puzzling
   phenomenon. The findings from the study provide supportive evidence of
   the presence of individual and environmental (distal and proximal)
   factors facilitating and impeding talented girls' STEM progression and
   retention, as proposed by SCCT theory.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine how 10th graders make use of different
   intertwined representations when solving algebraic word problems. It is
   structured in a quantitative phase, with 61 students and a subsequent
   follow-up case study with nine pairs of students. We found that drawings
   and tables, used as auxiliary representations within variants of the
   algebraic solving method, were useful in the construction of situation
   and/or problem models. However, this did not entail a higher rate of
   correct solutions, because students made errors in the subsequent
   conversion to equations due to misconceptions about the notion of
   equation. Teaching implications are discussed.},

Title = {Effects of Diverse STEM Role Model Videos in Promoting Adolescents'

Abstract = {Role models are critical for broadening participation in science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); however, little is
   known about STEM role model characteristics most likely to promote
   identification. This study focused on adolescents' preferences and
   identification with diverse STEM role models featured in online videos.
   Findings from a quantitative analysis of adolescents from a suburban
   community in the Midwest of the USA showed that same-sex and same-race
   STEM role models did not affect preference. Post hoc analysis indicated
   that students rated STEM role models who were established or early in
   their careers and fictitious STEM role model characters higher than
   portrayals of famous STEM professionals. Students rated role models who
   were female, non-white higher than female, white and male, non-white,
   but students did not rate them differently than male, white characters.
   Students rated female, white characters equivalently to male, non-white
   characters but lower than male, white characters. Lastly, male, white
   characters were rated higher than male, non-white characters. Findings
   from the qualitative analysis of adolescents' written reflections found
   identification with STEM role models who challenged gender and
   racial/ethnic STEM stereotypes, pursued interesting hobbies, and worked
   in STEM fields perceived as interesting. Implications for educators and
   media practitioners are discussed.},
