Abstract = {This paper establishes a method of supply-chain multi-attribute reverse
   auction. Presuming the tenderers' preference is open, the paper proposes
   a non-cooperative multi-attribute bidding game model about public
   construction projects and analyzes the bidding strategies of tenderers
   and bidders. Through the simulation of a case in China, we find that:
   (1) the more committed of the tenderers to construction quality and
   schedule, the greater benefits, enthusiasm in bidding, and tenderer's
   surplus; (2) the bidder's benefits have a U-shaped relationship
   respectively with the bidding quality and the construction period; and
   (3) the greater the bidder's construction quality and period cost
   coefficients, the smaller the tenderer's surplus. Such conclusions
   indicate, the improvement of the bidding rules or procedures can
   contribute to restricting the behavior of tenderer and bidder,
   furthermore reducing the corruption possibility of public construction
   projects.},

Abstract = {The development level of port finance has an important influence on the
   development of port economy. Under the background of the new economy and
   the construction of the 21st century Maritime Silk Road, the
   increasingly close economic and trade cooperation has put forward higher
   requirements for the financial development level of Shanghai Port. This
   paper takes Shanghai Port as the research object, analyzes the financial
   development level of Shanghai port by constructing Levin index, and
   takes the financial activity and financial scale of Shanghai Port as the
   dependent variable, selects the representative port container throughput
   and urban GDP of the financial environment factors and deposit and loan
   ratio of the financial system factors as independent variables. Then the
   VAR model is established to explore the influence of financial
   environment and financial system on the financial development level of
   Shanghai Port. The results show that the above-mentioned independent
   variables have positive effects on the financial activity and financial
   scale of Shanghai Port, and all have some lag. It shows that the level
   of financial development in Shanghai Port on the port of the financial
   environment and financial system has a certain dependence. Finally,
   according to the research results, some suggestions are put forward to
   improve the financial development level of Shanghai Port.},

Abstract = {The urgency of the paper is determined by the continuous information
   development of all spheres of education: integration of new knowledge,
   accessibility of information technologies and computer facility aids,
   professionalization and computerization of educational activities. The
   purpose of the research is to develop the structure and content of
   learning information environment in a higher education institute on the
   basis of geo-information technologies. The authors show the
   possibilities of using geo-information technologies in teaching outside
   the scope of their typical application (geographic, geodetic, geological
   education). The principles of designing the information environment for
   training on the basis of geo-information technologies are developed,
   which is built into the general information environment of higher
   education institute. The peculiarities of using geo-information
   technologies in non-core training are revealed, and the structure of
   learning environment modules based on geo-information technologies is
   developed and their content is described. The authors adapted the system
   of criteria evaluating the the effectiveness of training information
   environment, carried out an empirical study of the quality of education
   information environment in a higher education institute on the basis of
   geo-information technologies. The paper is intended for teachers,
   specialists in the field of information as means of education.},

Abstract = {In this study, it is aimed to design a computer game for the 7th grade
   Science lesson and evaluate the effect of the computer game on students'
   motivation and aggression. The quasi-experimental method has been
   selected as a quantitative method of research. The study group of the
   research is comprised of 444 7th grade students in total studying in 7
   different schools chosen from each region of Turkey. In this context,
   while there is no interference in one of the two 7th grade classrooms
   from each school, the other is sustained with a computer game as an
   additional material to the teaching process. The application proceeded
   through 2014-2015 academic year. Motivation towards Science and
   aggression scale have been applied to all groups three times; at the
   beginning of the first term, at the beginning of the second term and at
   the end of the second term. As a result of the research, the computer
   game is found to generate a meaningful difference on behalf of the
   experimental group and to have no effect on aggression. Computer games
   meet the deficiencies of a conventional educational system by promoting
   learning via games and creating an engaging atmosphere helping students
   increase their motivation.},

Abstract = {Conflict management strategies are crucial to enhance the culture of the
   schools even in rural areas. Communication enhancement and interaction
   between colleagues within the workplace require willingness to solve
   problems and develop positive perceptions on conflict. Storytelling
   approach and expression of the thoughts between colleagues to state
   problem and put forward steps for win policy in conflict situations are
   internalized in this research process. The research aims to reveal the
   role of storytelling approach in conflict management process for
   increasing the school achievement. The teachers acted voluntarily n the
   parts of the research. As the nature of the research relies on story
   telling approach, the qualitative research was employed and self-reports
   are used to gather in-depth data. The findings showed that teachers need
   in-service training on empathy for resolution of conflict through
   storytelling approach. In addition to this, it is revealed that team
   spirit, technology, professionalism, metaphors become a harmonic picture
   of story telling approach to enhance conflict management.},

Abstract = {Our purpose is to analyse the speed and contribution of the educational
   scientific and technological progress in the development of the primary
   forestry industry. In order to research the role of the educational
   scientific and technological progress in the development of the primary
   forestry industry more scientifically, the article employs the modified
   multi-factor two-level CES production function model, and the data from
   31 provinces over 19 years (1994-2012), to measure and calculate the
   speed and contribution of the educational scientific and technological
   progress in the development of the primary forestry industry from the
   two dimensions, time and space. The speed of educational scientific and
   technological progress in the primary forestry industry was 2.8\% from
   1994 to 2012, and the contribution rate of educational scientific and
   technological progress to the development of the primary forestry
   industry was 49.6\%. Through the measuring and calculating of different
   periods, it is found that there were big differences between different
   periods regarding to the contribution of the educational scientific and
   technological progress to the development of the primary forestry
   industry, and the contribution grew quickly in the last few years.
   Through the measuring and calculating of different areas, it is found
   that there were huge differences between different areas regarding to
   the contribution of the educational scientific and technological
   progress to the development of the primary forestry industry, due to the
   difference in nature, society and economic environment. Along with the
   development of the economy, the structure of the forestry industry needs
   important changes. The dominating status of the primary forestry
   industry in the forestry industry should be strengthened. The
   educational science and technology investment of the primary forestry
   industry should be boosted, to lead the development of the primary
   forestry industry onto a path relying on the progress of educational
   science and technology. In the process of making the development policy
   and investment policy on the primary forestry industry, it shall not
   impose uniformity in all cases. On the contrary, the policy shall vary
   according to the different situations; and it is noticed that the
   comparative advantages of different areas with different social economic
   and natural resources shall be exerted.},

Abstract = {When technology has successfully penetrated in all aspects of life, a
   discussion on public sphere and its relevance in today's scenario is
   becoming more complicated. It is needless to say that opinions will
   differ as the post-modern critics dissect Habermas' concept of public
   sphere with full acuity. As the mass media is being dominated by the
   Information and Communications Technology industry, the perceptible
   change and the aspect of critical publicity that Habermas emphasized on
   with a higher sense of responsibility is worth discussing.
   Computer-mediated communication and its uses in education is dominating
   today's age and the issue like commercialization, commodification, media
   ownership, instructional technologies are sometimes considered to be
   challenging the power of free, rational thinking and freedom of speech.
   This age of digitalization is definitely getting dependent to cyberspace
   more for every reason or the other, but what needs to be assessed is if
   this dependency is effecting the freedom of democratic discussion.},

Abstract = {The aim of the research is to study the possibilities of the final stage
   of working with a mathematical problem as a means of forming
   schoolchildren's creative activity. The leading method of investigating
   this problem is to establish the correspondence between the components
   of the final stage of working with the mathematical problem and the
   procedural features of the student's creative activity. The study
   resulted in defining the structure of the final stage of working with a
   mathematical problem, which made it possible to identify a certain set
   of activities that make up the ability to work with the problem on the
   final stage of its solution. The article establishes the relationship
   between actions appropriate to this stage of work with the task and
   signs of the student's creative activity. It is proved that in the
   process of working with the problem on the final stage of its solution,
   students develop procedural features of creative activity. The author's
   method of forming students' creative activity suggested in the article
   can be used by the teachers of mathematics in school practice, by the
   authors of methodological manuals for students and teachers, and also
   can be used as the basis for a special course for students of
   pedagogical universities.},

Abstract = {Chinese government puts forward a concept: five in one, putting
   environment in the same significant position as economy, politics,
   society and culture, which highlights the significance of environment.
   With the continuous increase of environmental awareness, many scholars
   pay more attention to green finance. However, the researches based on
   economic or social aspects, mostly stay on the theoretical level without
   studying how much people know about this concept. This paper, however,
   based on the questionnaire on Guangdong Undergraduates, aims to know
   about the deviation between undergraduates' awareness of the importance
   of green finance and the real situation. The results turn out that there
   are significant deviations in the following areas: concept, methods,
   reasons, purpose and representative principles, etc. Based on the
   results, the author tries to explain the reason of the existence of
   these deviations and the connection of enhancing education of
   environmental protection.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to investigate and compare the
   spatial conceptualization performance for sixth grade elementary school
   students from urban, suburban and remote schools in Taiwan. This study
   involved 27, 25, and 26 sixth grade students from one remote indigenous
   school in eastern Taiwan, one suburban indigenous school in northern
   Taiwan, and one urban Han Chinese school in northern Taiwan,
   respectively. Spatial ability assessments were carried out on the
   students to explore the spatial conceptualization abilities and the
   possible relationship between school children's spatial abilities and
   urban-rural, ethnic, and cultural diversities. The research tool
   utilized in this study was a scenario-based spatial ability assessment
   test, which had been carefully reviewed and pre-tested by experts. Test
   results revealed that: (1) Sixth grade students from the suburban and
   remote indigenous school shared no significant difference in their
   spatial abilities; (2) Sixth grade students from the urban Han Chinese
   school exhibited significantly better spatial performance than those
   from the suburban and remote indigenous schools. The spatial
   conceptualization performance for sixth grade elementary school students
   from urban, suburban and remote schools in Taiwan is different.},

Abstract = {This study presents a methodology for investigating teacher learning in
   and from practice based on discourses that are in constant flux and
   transformation. Conceptualizing teacher learning as a frame of meaning
   based on knowing and doing discourses, the ideas are illustrated through
   data collected from a secondary mathematics teacher conducting an
   inquiry of self-practice. Narrative analysis of the data from the
   teacher interviews was conducted along with classroom observations of
   the teacher's mathematical practice. The data supported that tracing
   shifts in teacher discourses enables to understand the connection
   between the teacher's past discourses and the present discourses when
   identifying teacher learning. It is concluded that tracking teacher
   learning through two complementary discourses of the teacher's
   instructional practice enabled a unification of individual and
   collective levels of the teacher learning by self-inquiry of own
   practice. Moreover, through the continuum of discourses, this study
   provided insights about the generation of new meanings through
   transformation of old meanings in the teacher learning.},

Abstract = {Since recommendation systems possess the advantage of adaptive
   recommendation, they have gradually been applied to e-learning systems
   to recommend subsequent learning content for learners. However, problems
   exist in current learning recommender systems available to students in
   that they are often general learning content and unable to offer
   personalized service. To overcome this, in the context of a learning
   style based on an Interpretive Structural Model (ISM), an adaptive
   learning path recommendation system is proposed comprising: (a) Fuzzy
   Delphi Method, (b) Fuzzy ISM and (c) Kelly Repertory Grid Technology.
   The results show that the learning outcome with ALPRS is better than
   those from general learning course guided recommendation mechanisms, and
   the scores of system satisfaction with ALPRS and personal service are
   higher than 90\%. Results of recall (95\%), precision (68\%), F1 index
   (45\%) and MAE (8\%) prove that ALPRS outperforms other approaches.
   Finally, three contributions are offered in this study:(1) a novel
   hybrid ALPRS is proposed and its practicability is tested; (2) a
   prototype gamification geometry-teaching material module is developed
   for the promotion in MSTE (Mathematics, Science and Technology
   Education) areas; (3) the adaptive geometry-learning path diagram
   generated with ISM based on learning styles could offer a basis for
   further studies.},

Abstract = {This study explored the relationship between teachers' content knowledge
   and their pedagogical skills, and reports on that relationship in the
   teaching of Assembly Drawing (AD) in a South African context. Given that
   Engineering Graphics Design (EGD) learners perform poorly in the AD
   section of the matriculation examination, we need to understand the
   extent to which this results from the quality of teaching. A case study
   approach was used to collect qualitative data from 25 purposively
   selected EGD teachers in the UThukela district of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN).
   Data was collected via an open-ended questionnaire, focus group
   interviews, lesson plans, observations, and post observation interviews.
   Our findings elucidate the relational interplay between teachers'
   understanding of AD and their teaching of AD. The majority of teachers
   failed to develop visual, spatial skills in learners. Our findings have
   implications for continuous teacher professional development.},

Abstract = {This study developed a set of Role-playing game (RPG), which was used to
   explore whether significant differences exist in academic performance
   and learning attitudes between RPG-based assessment and traditional
   lectures. This study also investigated the satisfaction of students
   toward the RPG scenario. Research participants included 100 second grade
   elementary students. The experimental results showed the different
   teaching methods affected the academic performance and learning attitude
   of second grade elementary students in fraction concepts. Learning by
   using RPG-based assessment can effectively improve the academic
   performance and learning attitudes of students. Students with high
   learning achievement were most satisfied with the RPG-based assessment
   scenarios, whereas those with low learning achievement demonstrated low
   levels of satisfaction. It is hoped that the innovative learning method
   provided by this study will help students.},

Abstract = {This study aims to assess the visual engagement of the video lectures.
   This analysis can be useful for the presenter and student to find out
   the overall visual attention of the videos. For this purpose, a new
   algorithm and data collection module are developed. Videos can be
   transformed into a dataset with the help of data collection module. The
   dataset is prepared by extracting the image frames from the video and
   marking them with a number of faces, the number of eyes, the status of
   eyes and the engagement score along with nominal values of engagement
   level. This data is transformed into time-based data items by using the
   attribute number of frames processed per second (PFPS). A case study for
   the assessment of TEDx video (length 8 minutes and 53 seconds) is
   included to validate the results and to extract statistical information
   from the dataset. Frames in the video are 16047 and they are transformed
   into 2675 keyframes. Machine learning classifiers are applied for the
   analysis of the dataset. The findings of this analysis help the
   presenter and the student to measure the quality of the visual content
   of the videos without actually going through it.},

Abstract = {It generally is accepted that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on
   learning. But literatures show the use of concept mapping is not benefit
   all learners. The present study explored the effects of incorporating
   computer-based concept mapping in physics instruction. A total of 61
   9th-grade students participated in this study. By using a
   quasi-experimental research approach, 31 students were assigned to a
   group that received computer-based concept mapping assisting instruction
   (CBCM), and 30 students were assigned to a constructive activities group
   that received ``Work, Power, and Energy Curriculum{''} instruction
   without concept mapping assistance (NCM). Both groups participated for
   eight weeks, with four sessions per week and 45 minutes per session. A
   pre test-post test control group design was employed. The findings
   revealed that the CBCM group students scored higher than the NCM group
   students on the cognition understanding and higher order thinking
   subtests. No significant differences were found in the conception
   memorization subtest. In the retention test, the students in the CBCM
   group outperformed the students in the NCM group on all subtests. The
   results of the current study revealed that concept mapping activities
   effectively promote higher order thinking and knowledge retention.},

   in the JBE and IJSE, and frequently studied topics were environment and
   ecology, genetics and biotechnology, and animal form and function. The
   findings were also indicated that learning, teaching and attitudes was
   in the forefront as the frequently investigated subject matters,
   undergraduate and secondary school students were mostly preferred as
   sample group and sample size mostly varies between 31-100 and 101-300.
   In addition, it was found out that interactive qualitative research
   designs were mostly preferred. Besides, that single data collection tool
   was generally used and this data collection tool included
   questionnaires, interviews and documents. Finally, frequency/percentage
   tables, central tendency measures, statistical analysis such as t-test
   and ANOVA/ANCOVA and content analysis were commonly used as data

Abstract = {Creating an attractive cityscape has become one of the most promising
   actions to improve urban functionality and increase urban
   competitiveness. However, the resistances from the local inhabitants are
   always against the urban development. Taipei City, a metropolis in
   Taiwan, is now composed of complex urban systems chaotically enclosed by
   existing and new urban environments. The city government is attempting
   to re-shape its cityscape by implementing a series of city regeneration
   plans, namely ``Taipei Beautiful{''}, considering the improvement of
   urban landscape, greenery open space, built environment, sustainable
   campuses and public facilities. These actions represent how Taipei city
   government educates its citizens toward to identify and recognize the
   benefits from the developments. Although Taipei Beautiful is an ongoing
   project, achievements of the current stage have revealed potentials to
   significantly increase the number of tourists, decrease energy
   consumption, and promote economic benefits. This study presents an
   overall review of educational strategies and actions enacted by the city
   government. Difficulties, challenges, and the role of the city
   government in affecting inhabitants' identification and recognition are
   also discussed. Lessons learned in Taipei City could be useful for other
   cities that are facing similar city development requirements.},

Abstract = {The development of the Internet and communication technology has
   revolutionarily changed the education contents and methods. Various
   governments and people with vision have promoted education to the
   highlight to determine the future of citizens in a nation. A teacher has
   to develop more creative teaching methods to teach new-generation
   students. Past research proved that cultivating students' creative
   thinking could significantly affect students' creativity and learning
   achievement. The approach of web-based era revolutionarily changed the
   media of creative thinking teaching. Applying design of experiment to
   the quasi-experimental research, total 186 universities and
   collegestudents in Taiwan are preceded a 4-month teaching program in
   this study. The research findings show 1. positively remarkable effects
   of web-based creative thinking teaching on creativity, 2. positively
   notable effects of creativity on learning outcome, and 3. positively
   significant effects of web-based creative thinking teaching on learning
   outcome. At the end, suggestions for teachers' teaching methods are
   proposed, expecting to make up the theories related to web-based
   creative thinking teaching.},

   Decision Making (MCDM) methodology to cross-evaluate the weighted
   questionnaire results based on three major analytical perspectives
   (higher education student's desires, online-learning technological
   functions and online-education scholar's considerations) to assess the
   interplays between the WHATs (students' online-learning interests) and
   the HOWs (the technological online-education measures), based on the
   higher research reliability and validity. According to the measured
   results, user's completely unrestricted operation, convenience,
   connectionization, openness and course complete rate are the most
   decisive five technological online-education determinants of MOOCs

Abstract = {``Building information technology{''} and ``cost estimating{''} are two
   core skills of construction education. However, in traditional
   education, students learn these two important subjects in separate
   courses. This study proposes a blended learning environment which can
   provide students with support for their face-to-face learning activities
   in the classroom and also give them the opportunity of ``learning by
   doing{''} through their practice with online construction projects in
   the web-based BIM (building information modeling) \& cost estimating
   system. Then the TAM3 (Technology Acceptance Model 3) theory was used to
   compare the expert and novice students' acceptance of this blended
   learning model. Finally, the path analysis method was used to verify the
   research hypotheses developed in this study based on the TAM3 method and
   then further explore the cause-effect among the TAM3 variables in these
   hypotheses. Our result found that the blended learning environment
   developed in this study was generally accepted by all the participating
   students and it could also enhance the students' acceptance of the
   blending learning strategy that combines classroom-based education and
   on-line learning. Even though there are significant differences between
   novices and experts in certain variables as found in this study,
   students can still achieve desirable learning results through repeated
   and continuous practice and learn how to solve problems through
   ``learning by doing{''} and discussions with their peers inside and
   outside the classroom. As a consequence, they will have better learning
   results in the end.},

Abstract = {In the information explosion era with constant changes of information,
   educators have promoted various effective learning strategies for
   students adapting to the complex modern society. The impact and
   influence of traditional teaching method have information technology
   integrated modern instruction and science concept learning play an
   important role. Teaching methods promoted in guided discovery
   instruction are to cultivate learners' abilities of discovery,
   exploration, problem-solving and independent thinking, and creation and
   invention through discovery or creative learning. Students could
   actively and positively participate in learning and integrate and
   construct knowledge by themselves. In other words, all knowledge is
   individually operated and explained, rather than passively acquired. By
   applying quasi-experimental research with experimental design, 98
   students in two classes in Fuzhou No. 1 Middle School and Affiliated
   High School of Fujian Normal University are preceded the 16-week (3hr
   per week) experimental teaching research. The research results reveal
   that 1. Guided discovery instruction would affect learning achievement,
   2.guided discovery instruction would influence learning retention, and
   3.learning achievement presents significantly positive effects on
   learning retention. Based on the research results, conclusions and
   suggestions are proposed at the end of this study, expecting to provide
   reference and improvement for teachers' teaching method.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a Science
   Technology and Society (STS) approach in terms of student understanding
   of major processes of science. Participants included twelve teachers who
   agreed to participate in an experimental study where Science,
   Technology, and Society (STS) strategies were utilized with one class
   section and in a school class where the teacher determined the course
   structure and the form of instruction (textbook-oriented) that is
   typically used by most science teachers. A total of twenty-four sections
   of students were in STS sections (199 students) and a similar number in
   textbook-oriented sections (204 students). The data collected were
   analyzed using quantitative methods. The results indicate that students
   in the STS sections achieved significantly better than students in the
   textbook-oriented sections in terms of understanding and using science
   process skills. Differences in success by male and female students of
   varying ability levels were examined as well.},

Abstract = {The PISA project has steadily increased its influence on the educational
   discourse and educational policies in the now 70 participating
   countries. The educational debate has become global, and the race to
   improve PISA-rankings has become high priority in many countries. For
   governments the PISA-test is a high-stake test. Governments are blamed
   for low scores, and governments are quick to take the honour when
   results are improving. National curricula, values and priorities are
   pushed aside. The influence of PISA is of high importance also for
   science educators; the battle to improve test results may conflict with
   our work to make science relevant, interesting and motivating for the
   learners. This article tries to unpack some of the challenges and to
   raise some of the problems caused by PISA as a global measure of
   quality.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to preservice science teacher education
   coupling video analysis with dialogue as tools for fostering teachers.
   ability to notice and reflexively interpret events captured during
   teaching practicum with the intent of transforming classroom practice.
   In this approach, video becomes a tool with which teachers connect
   theory and practice, and through dialogue, develop an appreciation for
   how one can inform the other. Specifically, we explore the role of
   cogenerative dialogue in structuring individual reflection and ongoing
   dialogue that help facilitate reflexivity. In doing so, we elaborate on
   the construct of reflexivity as a potential foundation for changing
   practices in the science classroom and we illustrate the ways in which
   reflexivity and action emerged from dialogic encounters around video
   analysis. We draw implications about the need for innovative teaching
   strategies, research initiatives, and changes in science teacher
   education},

Abstract = {Hans Niedderer (Figure 1) has contributed a lot to German physics
   education research. His work includes quantitative and qualitative
   studies about topics like the learning of physics concepts or the
   history and philosophy of science in science teaching, he has worked on
   theoretical issues as well as on textbooks. But it is not only his work
   that is remarkable. He was one of the physics educators in Germany who
   believed, from the early days of science education research on, in the
   need to conduct empirical studies. A closer look at his career provides
   insights into the development of the discipline of science education and
   into its establishment as a subject at German universities. In this
   interview, Hans Niedderer talks about the ``leaning pathway{''} of the
   discipline of science education in general - and about the value of
   researching learning pathways and learning progressions for science
   teaching. For more information and a bibliography of his work please
   visit his website:
   http://www.idn.uni-bremen.de/mitarbeiter\_eng.php?id=27. The interview
   with Hans Niedderer was conducted by Christoph Kulgemeyer in 2013 at the

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the questions that are used by
   teachers. In broader sense the intention is to focus on questions as
   part of teachers' formal as well as informal assessments. We will mainly
   concentrate on how students are assessed and how the questions in the
   assessments are formed and marked. The research is mainly qualitative
   having both descriptive and exploratory purposes. Questionnaire and
   semi-structured interviews are used as the research instruments
   Convenience sampling was chosen as the most appropriate purposeful
   sampling strategy for this study. The qualitative data obtained from 86
   teachers were categorised in terms of themes relevant to research
   questions and then these categorizations were coded. Data was collected
   in two phases. In the first phase a semi-structured interview was
   conducted to reveal the contexts in which teachers ask questions. Second
   phase started one month after the end of the first phase for which
   interviews and questionnaire were used together. Two dominant themes
   that emerged from this study are the effect of the institutional context
   teachers working within and the national examination system.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate upper primary school
   students' academic development in science courses and to evaluate their
   views and feelings about self-learning processes through journals.
   Students in 6th and 7th grade wrote journals twice a week for nine
   weeks. We evaluated the journals weekly according to the Science Journal
   Rubric (SCR), and individually observed students' academic developments.
   Subsequently, we also evaluated the journals by focusing on expressions
   in which students revealed their views and feelings about learning
   processes, excluding scientific concepts. We grouped the expressions
   containing views and/or feelings about the learning process into five
   categories. These categories were classmates, teacher, self-expressions,
   courses, and journals. The results supported the assertion that journals
   contain information not only about students' academic development but
   also about their personal and affective sides.},

Abstract = {Laboratory activities have long had a distinctive and central role in
   the science curriculum, and science educators have suggested that many
   benefits accrue from engaging students in science laboratory activities.
   Many research studies have been conducted to investigate the educational
   effectiveness of laboratory work in science education in facilitating
   the attainment of the cognitive, affective, and practical goals. In
   Israel, on 2000, the chemical education committee, based on a needs
   assessment survey, recommended that the new syllabus include a whole
   unit of inquiry-based laboratory as part of the learning sequence. The
   reform highlighted the laboratory unit as the central component in the
   new curriculum. In this paper we will describe the chemistry laboratory
   curriculum in Israel, its development, implementation and assessment
   strategies.},

   underlying philosophies, goals, objectives and recognized importance in
   science teaching. Even though all syllabi were prepared within the same

Abstract = {Conceptions of learning determine students' ways to learn, motivations
   and expectations in schools. Conceptions have potential to understand
   and mold their learning behaviors at schools. Certain types of
   conceptions of learning appear obvious feature of students performing
   poorly in schools. Literature suggests that students' conceptions of
   learning are affected by students' social and cultural backgrounds.
   Students in underdeveloped, minority and Asian social and cultures have
   quite different conceptions than the students in developed countries. In
   Pakistani public school, most students are from the lower socio-economic
   background. Available literature reports drill, memorization, and
   external regulation of learning and lack of adequate motivation to learn
   in students of these schools, which signpost undesired conceptions of
   learning. The current study deals with the students studying in
   Pakistani schools to determine and understand their conception of
   learning. A qualitative data collection approach was used to collect the
   data from the respondents. An approach of applied thematic analysis used
   reduced qualitative data into themes, sub-themes and into
   sub-sub-themes. The thematic analysis corroborated Pakistani secondary
   school science students' intake of knowledge and cooperation conceptions
   of learning. The findings were in line to various studies on Asian
   students. The high failing rate at secondary school level in science
   education in Pakistani schools is congruent to presence of intake of
   knowledge and cooperation conceptions of learning.},

Abstract = {The issue of scientific citizenship in the context of STEM education has
   been under debate for over two decades. We present a preliminary study
   which aims to investigate if, how and why the development of hard
   scientific skills grounded in the discipline of complex systems
   (suitably simplified and adapted) may foster the development of
   citizenship skills that can impact on people's approaches to facing
   problems and making decisions. We carried out a pilot study with a group
   of 34 volunteer adult citizens. The data analysis showed that: i) in the
   beginning, only a few participants were comfortable dealing with
   scientific and epistemological concepts related to complex systems,
   favouring instead a ``common sense{''} approach towards decision-making;
   ii) in some successful cases, there was an alignment between scientific
   competences and decision-making strategies, suggesting that it is
   possible to design activities based on authentic scientific concepts in
   order to develop citizenship skills.},

   relationships among technology acquisition \& exploitation,
   organizational innovation, and organizational performance. We selected
   80 knowledge-intensive organizations as statistical population of the
   study. Executive managers, senior managers, operational managers, and
   R\&D managers of the companies were considered as appropriate
   respondents for this study. After the distribution of 320 questionnaires
   among the respondents, 280 usable questionnaires were gathered. The
   analysis was done utilizing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)
   methodology by LISREL software. The factors analysis and the findings
   show that technology acquisition \& exploitation has a significant
   positive influence on both organizational innovation and organizational
   performance. Further, organizational innovation has a significant
   positive impact on organizational performance.},

Abstract = {Looking at the development of domestic industries, the industrial
   structure has turned from agriculture in the past to the focus on
   manufacturing and service industries. With constant investment in R\&D
   and the promotion of technology, manufacturing even turns to
   technology-intensive high-tech industry. Excellent talents and R\&D
   innovation capability have been the critical but difficult problems for
   high-tech industry. For this reason, the quality of work force and the
   product innovative R\&D capability in high-tech industry could merely be
   enhanced by reinforcing innovative education. Semiconductor
   manufacturers with the revenue ranked top three in 2016 in Taiwan are
   selected as the research subjects. Total 600 copies of questionnaire are
   distributed to the supervisors and employees, and 469 valid copies are
   retrieved, with the retrieval rate 78\%. The research results show
   significantly positive effects of 1.innovative education on innovation
   capability, 2.innovation capability on organizational performance and
   3.innovative education on organizational performance. According to the
   results, suggestions are proposed in this study, expecting to assist
   high-tech businesses in promoting human capital and innovation
   capability.},

Abstract = {Video Game-based learning has been an important way for practitioners to
   gear up for success. Advergames provide an exclusively learning
   environment in which video gamers pay full attention and thoroughly
   absorb information without interruption. But still very few studies have
   been devoted to understanding how individual's self-construal and for
   cognitive product involvement with advergame format influences the
   evolution of players perception of brand personality. This study was
   consisted of an experimental study in which a series of advergames was
   created and two distinct brands: a high and a low cognitively involving
   products were included as the stimulus. The study identified key
   measures of effectiveness in the context of 195 American and Chinese
   participants as subjects were randomly assigned to one of the
   experimental conditions. This study used 2 x 2 factorial
   between-subjects design. The two factors were individual's
   self-construal (interdepend and independent) and cognitive product
   involvement (high and low). The results revealed that the players with
   interdependent self-construal reported a greater influence on perception
   of brand personality than the players with independent self-construal.
   The results further verified an influence of self-construal on
   perception of brand personality in the different product involvement.},

Abstract = {Being in the era of the knowledge-based economy, knowledge would replace
   land, labor, capital, and equipment to become the primary production
   factor. An enterprise could create competitive advantages for the
   organization merely by constant knowledge accumulation and acquisition.
   Competitive advantages in the medical industry come from the efficacy of
   knowledge application that the execution of knowledge management is a
   pursued goal of medical institutions. Nurses in a hospital are like
   employees in an enterprise, and doctors are the senior supervisors in
   the organization. Supervisors in medical units must have the employees
   understand the attention from the hospitals so as to have nurses devote
   themselves to executing the organizational objectives. Aiming at
   hospitals in Shanghai, physicians and medical personnel in Shanghai
   Huashan Hospital were distributed with 420 copies of a questionnaire. A
   total 352 valid copies were retrieved, with the retrieval rate at 84\%.
   The research results conclude significantly positive effects of
   organizational support of knowledge management, knowledge management of
   organizational learning, and organizational support of organizational
   learning. Some suggestions are proposed at the end, expecting to assist
   the domestic medical industry in establishing market advantages.},

Abstract = {Customer resources is getting important when global economic
   competitiveness becomes serious as well as foreign advanced technology
   and talents flow more rapidly and become the development mainstream of
   Customer Relationship Management. Successful statistics education could
   integrate customer resources and Customer Relationship Management as
   well as enhance customer acquisition and create profits for higher
   return on investment. Besides, providing correct product information for
   suitable customers at proper time could reinforce customer relationship.
   Aiming at supervisors and employees in high-tech manufacturers in
   Hsinchu Science Park, total 500 copies of questionnaire are randomly
   distributed, and 388 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate
   78\%. The research results conclude significant correlations between
   1.statistics education and Customer Relationship Management, 2.Customer
   Relationship Management and customer value, and 3.statistics education
   and customer value. According to the results, suggestions are proposed,
   expecting to have domestic high-tech manufacturers keep long-term
   relationship with customers through Customer Relationship Management to
   further enhance customer value and create the market competitiveness.},

Abstract = {By focusing on the Chinese green education context, this study analyzes
   the environment and the status quo of China's green innovation, presents
   a ``4 Fundamental \& 3 Supported Bodies{''} green innovation paradigm
   based on user involvement electronic platform under Chinese green
   education context, namely, enterprises, universities, research
   institutes and users as the four fundamental bodies, and government,
   intermediary and financial institutions as supported bodies involved in
   green innovation paradigm through electronic platform. By using game
   theory and system dynamics, the mechanisms of green innovation based on
   user involvement electronic platform under Chinese green education
   context are simulated. Moreover, this study puts forward three specific
   operational modes, including: (1) the operational mode of user proposal,
   which is to seek the views and suggestions of users dynamically in the
   entire process of green innovation decision-making phase, green
   innovation of pilot phase, and green innovation of try-out phase, and
   absorb into the optimization process of innovation decision and
   innovative products; (2) the operational mode of user experience, which
   involves users' product and service experience into the innovation
   activities, as well as users' R\&D and production experience; and (3)
   the operational mode of user R\&D, which invites the users' designs
   collection and users' involvement in R\&D projects. Finally, the study
   takes NIU electric vehicle company in China as an example for case
   analysis.},

Abstract = {The emergence of mobile media has brought new opportunities and severe
   tests to the ideological and political education in universities. In
   order to improve and implement the effectiveness of ideological and
   political education of university students, we must fully realize that
   mobile media has become a new domain of ideological and political
   education. Ideological and political workers should strengthen the
   ideological and political education of university students under the
   influence of mobile media. This article takes the mobile phone media as
   a clue, and leads to the reflection of university students' mental
   health education. It aims to promote the benign development of mobile
   media, and calls on the community to pay more attention to the
   psychological health education of university students. The multiple
   linear regression model is applied to study the influence of mobile
   phone media application on mental health education of university
   students, the positive and negative influence of mobile phone media on
   university students' psychological health education in university
   students' cognitive ability, communicative ability, life and emotion
   regulation ability and other aspects are obtained, and the improvement
   strategies are proposed.},

Abstract = {Since the mid-1990s, both domestic and international tourism in China
   has grown rapidly in many destinations. In particular, city tourism
   plays an important role as a major destination in regional tourism
   development. To promote tourism, understanding image and promotion has
   become the key point in the development of regional tourism economy.

Abstract = {More and more people enjoy the brand new experience an e-book brings to
   them, but the traditional e-book is plenty of room for improvement. One
   of the reasons is that the book has to be read page by page; thus, it is
   not easy to grasp the overall structure of such a book. As such, we
   propose a novel system based on the information retrieval technologies
   to automatically create the keyword concept map for each section of the
   book. Moreover, in addition to showing the context where each keyword in
   the concept map is located, with each keyword in the concept map is
   associated a hyperlink, to make it easy for a reader to move to the
   context associated with the keyword. Equipped with the keyword concept
   map and the hyperlink associated with each keyword, it can be expected
   that the learning achievement of the reader can be raised. Our
   experimental results show that the proposed e-book system with the
   keyword concept map can provide a better learning result than a
   tradition e-book does in terms of both the scores received after
   learning and practicing and the results of satisfaction questionnaire on
   learning, practicing, and system satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Information has become a kind of resource wealth in the development of
   contemporary society, it is the spread of the channel, and exchange
   method may also be with the development of society and constantly
   changes. In recent years, the concept of healthy China has attracted
   wide attention. This paper USES a series of research methods, according
   to research shows that in modern times I for sports academic research am
   on the rise, sports study power is widely dispersed throughout the
   province. But all obvious gap, unbalanced development. Since modern
   times, China has involved the development of sports academic major
   sports, but there is still a problem, the major sports projects and
   project research among their strength is different, therefore there is a
   lot of strong project; At the same time, there are also some weak
   project, even the outline. This article also in the pro-cess of
   development and transformation of sports academic problems put forward
   some Suggestions and solutions, In the study of health education to
   become a global concern, it provides some meaningful exploration.},

Abstract = {This study explored the effects of a collaborative computer-based
   concept mapping strategy on Geographic Science learning outcomes in
   junior high school students. A quasi-experimental approach was applied
   to a sample of 85 9th grade students. Class instruction lasted for five
   weeks, with two classes each week. Using the quasi-experimental research
   approach, 27 students were assigned to a constructive activities group
   that received instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM), 28
   students were assigned to a group that received individual
   computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) assisted instruction, and 30
   students were assigned to a group that received collaborative
   computer-based concept mapping (CCBCM) assisted instruction. We explored
   the impact of these methods of instruction on students' memorization,
   understanding, and application of concepts and on their higher order
   cognitive ability. The findings revealed that the CCBCM and CBCM groups
   scored better than the NCM group on the post-test. On the retention
   test, the CCBCM group outperformed the NCM group on all subtests.},

Abstract = {This article examines the use of technology through creative
   collaborative drama writing as opposed to using only the traditional
   ``chalk and talk{''} methods of teaching for Language Classes based on
   the students' perspectives. The research was conducted with first year
   English Literature students who took a Literary Terminology course over
   a period of ten weeks. The data were collected through observation of
   the course instructor and interviews. A qualitative approach was used in
   this study. A case study was chosen and questions were prepared for a
   semi-structured interview form in order to gather data. Content analysis
   was used to examine the data. The purpose of this study is to reveal the
   importance of alternative, innovative and effective teaching
   applications in English language teaching. It is believed that, if
   teachers or teacher candidates experience student-centred and modern
   teaching methods, they will have increased capacity to deliver lectures
   with higher quality. When the findings of the research are examined, it
   can be seen that the teachers experienced time management problems, both
   before and after the application. Consequently, it is believed that
   teachers and teacher candidates require time management training for
   class activities.},

Title = {Market-Oriented LSP Training in Higher Education: Towards Higher

Abstract = {In the 21st century globalization accelerates the need for English
   communication skills as English is recognized as a lingua franca in the
   business world. A high priority of university educators involved in LSP
   (LSP - language for special purposes) training is to equip graduates
   with communicative LSP skills meeting the standards of huge and
   increasingly competitive job market. The study addresses the issue on
   how to close the current gap between prospective employers' expectations
   of English communication skills level and the existing LSP level of
   graduates. The study aims at, first, to reveal the effect of English
   globalization on employability from the perspective of university
   students; second, to identify factors leading to reticence in speaking;
   and third, to provide a solution to the problem of gap between
   graduates' oral skills and employers' expectations. The study uses two
   questionnaires as an instrument to collect data. The obtained
   quantitative data is used as an input for qualitative study. The study
   certifies that undergraduates are fully aware of the utmost importance
   of English language for employment. Also, the study identifies the main
   social and psycholinguistic reasons hindering to develop speaking skills
   in the university settings. Further, the research findings have been
   used to develop and integrate into university training curricula an
   intensive 3-module program meeting the real needs of students and
   business community. The goal of this program is to equip students with
   excellent English communication skills meeting the rapidly changing job
   market demands. The findings of the study suggest that LSP training
   offered at higher school should be improved to meet job market
   requirements. The study enabled to assess the instruction results and
   provide a solution to the problem of ``competency gap{''}. It points to
   where the real work of closing the gap between the need for workforce
   skilled in English communication and actual graduates' skill level needs
   to happen.},

Abstract = {As pupils are largely increased the opportunities to contact digital
   games, the effect of digital games has been broadly discussed and
   studied. Digital games no longer play the function of entertainment, but
   could assist students in more active learning and deeper and broader
   learning, when being applied to instruction. It is limited to learn in
   classes that combining courses with situated digital games presents the
   immersive feeling. This study therefore intends to discuss the effect of
   digital game-based instruction on students' learning motivation and
   achievement. Three universities in Taiwan, which are listed on top
   universities in Taiwan province, are selected as the research subjects
   in this study. With experimental research, total 326 students of two
   classes each from the three universities are preceded the experimental
   teaching for 3 hours per week for 16 weeks (total 48 hours). The
   research results are summarized as below. 1. Game-based instruction
   would affect learning motivation. 2. Game-based instruction would
   influence learning achievement. 3. Learning motivation presents
   significantly positive effects on learning effect in learning
   achievement. 4. Learning motivation shows remarkably positive effects on
   learning harvest in learning achievement. Aiming at the research
   results, it is expected to propose suggestions for education studies and

Abstract = {At present, in social transition period of China, reform of higher
   education is in full swing, with workload, job difficulty of university
   teachers greatly increased than before. Plus unique values and
   personality characteristics of the Millennial Generation, mental health
   of university teachers of the Millennial Generation has aroused more and
   more attention. However, research is still not enough. In this paper,
   questionnaire survey method was used to analyze the relationship between
   occupational stress, positive coping style, negative coping style, job
   burnout and mental health of university teachers of the Millennial
   Generation, and explore which path has the greatest effect on mental
   health with university survey data of Shaanxi Province, China from
   January 2016 to June 2016. It is found that occupational stress can
   produce significant positive predictive effect on negative coping style
   and job burnout, and have a significant negative predictive effect on
   positive coping style; Negative coping style has significant positive
   predictive effect on job burnout and mental health of university
   teachers of the Millennial Generation; Positive coping style has
   significant negative predictive effect on job burnout and mental health
   of university teachers of the Millennial Generation; Job burnout of
   university teachers of the Millennial Generation has significant
   positive predictive effect on mental health; Among all the paths that
   affect mental health, occupational stress has the greatest effect on
   mental health through job burnout. This study reveals the mechanism of
   influence of occupational stress on mental health of university teachers
   of the Millennial Generation, which can provide decision-making
   reference for colleges and universities to formulate strategies to
   intervene university teachers of the Millennial Generation's mental
   health problems from individual psychological level and strengthen
   mental health management of university teachers of the Millennial
   Generation.},

Abstract = {Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2016)
   released the results of Programme for International Student Assessment
   (PISA) 2015 and reported that the students' performance in mathematics
   of Singapore and Indonesia had significant differences. There is a
   strong relationship between textbooks used and mathematics performance
   of the students. If textbooks differ, students will get a different
   opportunity to learn and the opportunity to learn influences students'
   achievement (performance). The purpose of this study was to analyze the
   trigonometry contents and cognitive demand levels in Singaporean and
   Indonesian mathematics textbooks. The data were primarily qualitative.
   Horizontal and vertical analyses were used in this study. The result
   showed that Singaporean textbooks put more emphasis on all the concepts
   of trigonometry on right-triangle and further trigonometry (sine/cosine
   rules) while Indonesian textbook provided more discussions on angle and
   its concepts, trigonometry on right-triangle, and graph function of
   trigonometry (which is a lot more difficult than sine/cosine rules). In
   addition, Singaporean textbook provided more mathematical questions
   requiring higher cognitive demand levels while, Indonesian textbook
   provided more questions requiring lower levels. The differences of
   textbooks contents and required cognitive demand level probably
   influenced students' mathematics performance in the two countries. It is
   hoped that the results will inform curriculum designers and/or
   textbooks' author(s) in Indonesia, Singapore, and other countries as
   they review and update the mathematics curriculum and/or mathematics
   textbooks.},

Abstract = {Understanding high school students' engagement in science is important
   for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Drawing on data from the ROSE Survey
   conducted in Abu Dhabi schools in 2013, this paper used a
   multi-dimensional framework to explore associations between high school
   students' engagement in science and a range of student psychosocial and
   behavioral factors. The results of multi-level regression revealed that
   students' emotional and cognitive engagement in science was most
   strongly related to students' confidence in abilities in science,
   students' perceived benefits of S\&T, students' views about science and
   scientists, student's out-of-school experience, and the job orientation
   of self-actualization. Students' future career aspiration in science was
   also associated with students' gender, grade, and socioeconomic
   background, which highlighted the role of social values, gender
   socialization, and family cultural capital in understanding students'
   occupational engagement in science. These factors and policy
   implications were discussed in the light of international research
   findings and the empirical context of Abu Dhabi where the transformation
   of socioeconomic development is taking place.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine Korean middle school students' view
   about scientific inquiry with the Views about Scientific Inquiry (VASI)
   questionnaire, an instrument that deals with eight aspects of scientific
   inquiry. 282 Korean middle school students participated in this study,
   and their responses were classified as informed, mixed, and naive. The
   results revealed that Korean middle school students primarily held mixed
   or naive views about scientific inquiry. To discover why students held
   these views, their responses were analyzed in detail. For instance, they
   did not understand the meaning of `experiment', `scientific', `data',
   and `evidence' well. They understood scientific terminology and
   scientific inquiry in everyday contexts. Students also tended to regard
   science process skill as scientific method. According to the results
   mentioned above, explicit and reflective instruction is necessary to
   develop students' views about scientific inquiry.},

Abstract = {The importance of researching the opinions of students and teachers has
   been pointed out concerning the improvement of teaching and learning in
   laboratory environments. In this regard, a study of the laboratory
   environment was carried out from a diversity of perspectives and
   methodologies. By means of a questionnaire it was learned that the
   perception of the actual laboratory environment was clearly positive,
   with clear similarities but also some differences among participants.
   While the retrospective narrative has helped explain some of these
   differences, such as a less positive assessment by the teacher of the
   material environment as regards the large number of students for the
   limited laboratory space, the students' assessment is highly homogeneous
   and does not appear to be influenced by these conditions. The use of a
   fast and simple quantitative tool has provided the participants' general
   outlook, complemented by the qualitative depth of the retrospective
   account provided by the teacher.},

Abstract = {Background:
   The water birds are inseparable part of the environment and ecosystems.
   This group of birds has got an important role in the functioning of
   aquatic ecosystems make them sensitive indicators of the health of these
   environments.
   Material and methods:
   The main aim of the study was to find out the attitudes toward and
   knowledge about water birds among lower secondary school pupils. The
   partial aims was to find out the influence of demographic variables like
   gender, grade, residence and the ownership of pet on the attitudes
   toward and knowledge about water birds. The sample size consisted of 340
   lower secondary school pupils from Czech Republic. The obtained data
   were analyzed by the methods of descriptive (mean score), inferential
   (analysis of variance) and also multidimensional statistics (factor
   analysis).
   Results:
   The gender and grade level of pupils had got significant level on
   knowledge. All observed variables had got significant level on the
   attitudes toward water birds. And the relationship between knowledge and
   attitudes was negative.
   Conclusions:
   The implications to educational practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Communicative learning progress in industry and education must gain
   focus and commitment otherwise innovation efforts by new technologies
   and recent researches will produce scarce results. Frequently, it
   appears gaps in quality and efficiency due to lack of ideas
   assimilation, matter that can be noticed. Investigators may discourse
   about platforms which serve as communication medium for instructor and
   participants. The objective is to propound Human-Computer Interaction
   group activity where it is crucial to display program key contents
   through Twitter. The inputs are goals and instructions related to a
   scheduled task for a session. Messages and comments are managed by the
   students in classroom to accomplish learning actions, announcements
   deployed with basic schoolroom equipment (projector, speakers, laptops,
   Wi-Fi). A case with new. EXE code is developed containing main commands
   and targets of the activity aided by Augmented Reality. This paper
   alludes to some data structure architectures, communication layers and
   configuration of system.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of technology, incorporation of Information
   Communication Technology (ICT) for formative assessment purpose has been
   increasing over the past decade. This article describes the design and
   development of identification of students' misconceptions in an
   individualized learning environment (iSMILE) system that includes
   accommodations for students' misconceptions in order to improve
   student's conceptual understanding and finally learning outcome. The
   assessment process is carried out by preparing two-level multiple-choice
   questions. Misconceptions are identified for each instructional
   objective to make a root question and linked questions. Depending on the
   answers provided by the student in first level, the linked questions are
   given to get more information regarding the misconception. Based on the
   first and second level answers of students, feedbacks are provided with
   the misconception identified. One of the most important differences of
   our iSMILE system, with respect to the other developed systems, is the
   inclusion of misconception based feedback. The iSMILE system has been
   developed by using open source ICT tools (like MySQL, Apache, etc.)
   which make the system free of cost and accessible and editable by any
   instructor from anywhere and at any time.},

Abstract = {Whereas equity issues are mainly discussed with respect to students at
   risk, this article focuses on mathematical potentials of
   under-privileged students and therefore elaborates a wide, dynamic and
   participatory conceptualization of (sometimes still hidden) mathematical
   potentials. An extended research review theoretically and empirically
   grounds the presented approach for uncovering and enhancing (possibly
   underprivileged) students in design principles for the instructional
   design and the ways in which teachers notice students' and situations'
   potentials. Dual design research methodology on students' and teachers'
   level is adopted to develop whole class enrichment settings with rich
   tasks and empirically study the initiated processes. The empirical
   investigation of the classroom processes show that the chosen design
   principles can enhance the intended enrichment processes on the student
   side, but need to be strongly supported by teachers' expertise in
   noticing and fostering students. An important outcome is the perspective
   model for teachers' necessary diagnostic perspectives for noticing and
   enhancing the potentials. Consequences are formulated for professional
   development programs.},

Abstract = {Sequencing contents is of great importance for instructional design
   within the teaching planning processes. We believe that it is key for a
   meaningful learning. Therefore, we propose to formally establish a
   partial order relation among the contents. We have chosen the binary
   relation ``to be a prerequisite{''} for that purpose. We have applied
   this approach to the mathematical contents of the compulsory Secondary
   Education of the Spanish educational system and the information obtained
   has been modeled as a graph. The amount of contents considered (814) and
   the number of ordered pairs in the order relation considered (17,782)
   has produced a big graph. In order to work effectively with that amount
   of data, we have used software specialized in network analysis. More
   precisely, we have used the software packages Pajek and Gephi. This
   software, together with the use of techniques borrowed from graph
   theory, has allowed providing a tool for debugging curriculum
   developments (similar to rule based expert systems verification).},

Abstract = {This paper was designed to establish the relationships between faculty
   members' use and attitude towards Learning Management Systems (LMSs).
   LMSs have been adopted in various educational institutions due to their
   numerous applications and functionalities to improve pedagogy. As a
   result, faculty members are urged to utilise them for enhancing teaching
   and learning practices. Underpinning this study was a questionnaire
   distributed to 222 faculty members in six universities. Cross-
   tabulation in a bar graph and chi-square test were conducted to verify
   observed differences. The findings revealed that older generation (over
   40 years) tended to use LMS for many of their teaching activities than
   the younger counterparts. LMS was not actively used for most teaching
   purposes. Statistically significant association existed between
   resources organisation via LMS and restriction level (chi.2 (12) =
   24.890, p = 0.015). Attitude of faculty members who do not use LMS in
   pedagogy differ from those who use it for some and most teaching
   activities in terms of online examination and social media. Evaluations
   of personal and institutional experiences of LMS tools determine use and
   attitude.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a part of a study which was conducted to determine
   the effect of van Hiele theory based instruction in the teaching of
   geometry to Grade 10 learners. The sample consisted of 359 participants
   from five conveniently selected schools from Mthatha District in the
   Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. There were 195 learners in the
   experimental group and 164 learners in the control group. The
   experimental group was given van Hiele theory based geometry instruction
   and the control group was given traditional method of geometry
   instruction. A multiple choice geometry test was administered to the
   participants before and after five weeks of instruction (pre- and
   post-test design). The results indicated a statistically significant
   difference in the mean scores in favour of the experimental group. The
   significant improvement in the performance of the experimental group
   having more learners at level 2 than at level 0 and level 1 suggest that
   the van Hiele-based instruction had a positive effect in raising the
   learners' levels of thinking compared to traditional instruction.},

Abstract = {This paper explores science teachers' experiences, views, and
   preferences of what constitutes effective teacher professional
   development. The research method utilised both quantitative and
   qualitative analyses. The former was used with responses from
   closed-ended questions while responses to an open-ended question were
   analysed qualitatively. The questionnaire was administrated to science
   teachers in Saudi Arabia of both genders with a variety of teaching
   experiences, science specialisms and to those teaching in primary,
   middle and secondary stage schools. The findings indicate that teachers
   have concerns about continuing professional development (CPD) programmes
   offered to them. Teachers' description of CPD showed that they were
   passive recipients of a pre-packed programme paving the way to how they
   form their professional identity. Teachers reflected on the aspects that
   can lead to effective CPD. Drawing on the findings, this paper presents
   a framework for effective CPD for science teachers where teachers are
   collaborative, proactive as leaders of reform and with positive
   professional identities in a context of reform.},

Abstract = {This study explores the relationship between students' clicking
   behaviors, discussion processes, learning outcomes, and a prominent
   feature of clicker systems-the whole class' response results aggregated
   by clickers in real time. The results indicate that, while teaching
   Newton's laws of motion, displaying the real-time responses of the whole
   class to clicker questions can influence students' discussion processes
   and conceptual learning outcomes. The results have practical
   significance because that (1) the instructional design presented in this
   study (i.e., peer instruction) is widely used in clicker-integrated
   science instruction; and that (2) the effect sizes reported in this
   study are larger than the small magnitude. Implications for science
   teaching and technological development with clickers are discussed. A
   prototype of an advanced clicker system, developed based on the results
   of this empirical study, is presented at the end of this article.},

Abstract = {Twenty-eight freshmen majoring in biology and/or chemistry in an Arab
   college in Israel, were given a pre-test and a post-test in which they
   had to identify the control group and design a controlled experiment.
   During the course an intervention was used. Science was taught by
   inquiry while using strategies that promote higher-order thinking skills
   like case studies and reading scientific research articles. The study
   found that learning methods had a significant effect on developing HOTS
   among the study participants. Also, the students expressed positive
   attitude, both emotionally and cognitive as a result of the

Abstract = {This study investigated the influence of metacognitive guidance on
   pre-service science teachers' scientific knowledge, science process
   skills, and views about the nature of science. The sample included 48
   pre-service science teachers taking a first-year chemistry laboratory
   course in a public university in Turkey. During the 11-week course, the
   students conducted 11 experiments. Four scales were administered to a
   control group and an experimental group as pre- and post-tests.
   Differently from control group, experimental group discussed the
   experimental design and completed a reflection form before and after
   each experiment. Moreover, experimental group answered questions about
   daily life implications. Results indicate that the inclusion of
   metacognitive guidance helped the students in the experimental group to
   improve their process skills and conceptual understanding.},

Abstract = {In this study, an instrument, Using Mathematics in Science Self-efficacy
   Scale (UMSSS), was developed in order to determine preservice science
   teachers' self-efficacy toward the use of mathematics in their lessons.
   Data gathered from 250 preservice science teachers were used for
   Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis
   (CFA). The factor analysis revealed 3 factors: Self Perception of
   Mathematics (SPM), Utilization of Mathematics (UM), and Mathematical
   Skills (MS). The cronbach alpha coefficient for the overall instrument
   was computed 0.88. The analyses resulted in the development of a
   three-factor scale of 18 items that was shown to be valid and reliable.
   At the same time, this instrument is also the first original instrument
   developed for determining the preservice science teachers'
   self-efficacies toward the use of mathematics in their lessons.},

Abstract = {Social media plays a role in the development of a personal knowledge
   system and personal creativity. This paper develops a theoretical model
   to analyze the relation between social media and creative expression in
   design education. Based on the flow theory, the generativity theory, and
   TAM, the paper collects data regarding the usability dimension of
   students in social media, and their creativity, and examines the
   proposed model through statistical software SAS9.4 to analyze the data.
   A correlation is seen between the usability dimension of social media
   and the creative expression dimension, with an especially significant
   positive connection between perceived ease of use and perceived
   usefulness, as well as capturing and challenging. The adoption intention
   of social media is positively correlated with creative expression, while
   the usability dimension of social media has positive correlation with
   broadenings and negative correlation with surroundings; however, neither
   is significant. This reveals that aimlessly accumulating knowledge
   through social media will not help students improve their creativity;
   instead, overusing social media hinders one from understanding the real
   world and gaining inspiration. The paper is conducive to better social
   media design and higher personal creativity.},

Abstract = {China has promoted green campuses for decades. To better explore the
   current extent of pro-environmental awareness and behaviors of types of
   stakeholders (student, faculty members, and administrators) on campus,
   this study investigated the relationship between pro-environmental
   awareness and pro-environmental behaviors along with the influences of
   motivators, barriers, and culture (face (reputation) and group
   pressure). A questionnaire survey was conducted with a sample of the
   three types of stakeholders at Tianjin University, one of the largest
   academic institutions and the earliest to implement green campus
   development initiatives in China. Structural equation modeling tested a
   causal model of awareness, behaviors, and other explanatory variables.
   The results found that pro-environmental behaviors were more likely than
   awareness and the respondents engaged in private more than in public
   pro-environmental behaviors. Chinese social and cultural factors
   influenced pro-environmental behavior, particularly among the
   administrators, which informs our understanding of the reasons for the
   awareness-behavior gap. China's universities focus on eco-technology and
   energy management rather than on dissemination and publicity. The
   results suggest that advancing a pro-environmental cultural atmosphere
   and a consistent sustainability policy might significantly foster
   pro-environmental behaviors on university campuses.},

Abstract = {The study compares the learning satisfaction of two student groups, one
   takes the fully online course-Introduction to Internet of Things, and
   the other takes the small private online course (SPOC). In the research
   framework, learning satisfaction is the dependent variable, and learning
   engagement, learning presence, video perception, platform perception,
   and design perception are independent variables. This work adopts online
   questionnaire survey to collect data from the two student groups. As to
   research method, Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) is utilized to test
   proposed research framework. The results of MRA show that platform

   the new century is that it has entered the stage of massification
   development, and the reform and development of higher education presents
   new features. This paper intends to summarize the massification of
   higher education and discusses development stage and development
   characteristics of China's higher education massification, and combines
   with the development of higher education in recent years to analyze the
   progress of China has made in massification of higher education, and
   puts forward that China's higher education massification development is
   changing from pursued and passive mode to the active mode. Systematic
   research on practical teaching of undergraduate engineering education
   helps to provide theoretical and practical basis for policy makers of
   educational authorities, and change the view of practice teaching. In
   this paper, through literature research, survey research and case
   analysis, the problems existing in the teaching practice are summarized
   and the reasons behind the problem are analyzed. The concept of practice
   teaching is organized to build the standard for cultivating talents of
   undergraduate engineering education, on this basis, the curriculum
   content is updated, curriculum system is reconstructed and teaching
   methods are reformed. The perfection of university practice teaching
   mechanism promotes the development of university teaching reform and

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of TRIZ (Teoriya
   Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadatch) instructional strategies on
   students' imaginative learning. The subjects of this study were students
   from a vocational school in Taiwan. The quasi-experimental method was
   used to incorporate TRIZ instructional strategies into imaginative
   learning and practice and to analyze the effect of these strategies on
   students' imaginative learning in their learning portfolios. In
   addition, a documentary analysis was used to supplement an analysis of
   the key factors involved with imaginative learning and practice. TRIZ
   instructional strategies significantly positively affected students'
   imaginative learning abilities and can aid in their imaginative learning
   and practice. Based on the results, this paper summarizes 5-stage key
   factors, constructs the IDEAL-P imagination teaching model, and offers
   suggestions for providing students with diversified imaginative learning
   portfolios, all of which can effectively improve students' imaginative
   learning and practice.},

Abstract = {The relevance of this study is determined by the algorithm developed for
   test task selection. The purpose of this article is to develop this test
   task selection algorithm having single and multiple-choice answers with
   various blocks of reactions. The main approach to the study of the
   problem is the construction of a mathematical model to calibrate test
   task parameters and the university students' scale of knowledge level.
   The study has proven insufficient use of the classical theory of testing
   in an objective assessment of students' knowledge. The method for
   calibrating test task parameters is developed. Scales of testees'
   readiness level are defined. The adequate size of test reliability
   coefficient is found. The rule for test task selection is formulated. A
   formula for the complexity degree of a test task is found. An algorithm
   for allocation of test task types with unambiguous and multiple-choice
   answers with various blocks of reactions is offered.},

Abstract = {The Wolfram applications enable direct access to several main
   information sources (databases) and enable the data to be analysed
   easily. This offers developing information literacy on authentic
   material in chemistry education. For chemical compound identification:
   CAS, CID and Beilstein Numbers are used. In this paper, the authors
   focused on the ambiguousness of carbohydrate identification using these
   numbers. Altogether, there are 1498 compounds listed under the CAS
   Number, whereas CID and Beilstein Numbers are not assigned to every
   compound with CAS. During the analysis, several hundred entries with
   duplicate records were found, providing ambiguous information about the
   compounds. The authors focus on ambiguous database records, further
   analyse the physical properties of two compounds with several assigned
   identification numbers. This approach offers a suggestion on how to work
   with this topic in education, offering fruitful educational content.},

Abstract = {This study has been conducted with the aim of descriptively evaluating
   the Curriculum of Elementary School Third Grade Science Course. In this
   study, the elementary schools in Ankara have been divided into three
   groups, which are ``high level, medium level, and low level'', based on
   their success levels. The results of the study suggest that in terms of
   achievement level of prerequisite behaviors regarding the curriculum and
   achievement level of the acquisitions included in the curriculum, there
   is a significant difference between groups, which is in favor of the
   high level group. Similarly, it has been detected that in terms of both
   academic self-concept levels of students in the Third Grade Science
   Course and the quality of the education service given in the Elementary
   School Third Grade Science Course, there is a significant difference
   between groups, which is in favor of the high level group.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of measurements on 3D
   models obtained with a CBCT and digital scanner, comparing with analog
   dental plaster casts and therefore determine whether the aforementioned
   digital models could be implemented in dental education. A total of 120
   archived maxillary plaster models were digitized by using two different
   CBCT techniques, (NewTom, and 3G Planmeca ProMax 3D), and Cerec Omnicam
   Digital Scanner, Sirona. The mean absolute values among the plaster
   models, IDS models, and CBCT scans were in the range of 0.12 mm-0.33 mm.
   The intraclass correlation coefficients for all measured variables
   showed high reliability. The mean differences for arch width such as
   inter-canine, inter-premolar and inter-molar as well as mesiodistal
   width measurements exhibited a mean difference value higher than 0.3 mm
   (p<.05). Digital models acquired from plaster casts were reliable for
   clinical orthodontic practice. Therefore, the use of digital models
   provides a reliable alternative to plaster models and it can be used in
   dental education.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a `Water strider' Inquiry
   Learning Program for improved inquiry learning, and to analyze the
   validity of the `Water strider.' The Inquiry Learning Program's goal was
   to create an application for finding out an on-site applicability for
   the ` Water strider' Inquiry Learning Program through the Elementary
   school teachers' workshop. The following are the summarizations of the
   main issues of study. First, the `Water strider' Inquiry Learning
   Program, (or W.S.I.L.P. for short) consisted of five subjects:
   comprehension of surface tension, collecting and raising water striders,
   the secret of water striders' body, the condition of floating water
   striders, and making the model of water striders. There were 10 small
   group activities which were organized by themes including Prediction,
   Observation, Explanation, Reflection, and an Additional questions stage.
   Using these, the students could then comprehend the water strider's
   structural features and the scientific principles. Secondly, in the
   assessment of on-site applicability, which elementary school teachers
   directly implemented, each activity consisted of immediate manipulation
   activities to help increase the students' interest. They were not only
   able to easily comprehend the scientific inquiry ability, but also the
   inquiry ability of the W.S.I.L.P. The `Water strider' Inquiry Learning
   Program can also be useful for science club activities in addition to
   the regular curriculum time because of the integrative lessons that will
   be available by using the `Water strider' Inquiry Learning Program.},

Abstract = {Coordinating the relation between curriculum system, teacher
   achievements and student academic records is an urgent question to be
   solved. Solute the question needs a multi-disciplinary knowledge,
   multi-sectoral cooperation. Related operations include qualification,
   evaluation of quantitative management, process guidance, personality
   analysis and rating subsystems. In order to solve the problem of
   colleges management, the colleges urgently needs an intelligent
   management system for the evaluation, guidance and auditing of academic
   records. First of all, the paper analyzes the state of academic records
   at home and abroad. This paper puts forward the records system of
   college students' academic records based on Browser / Server structure,
   which is based on the records of relevant scholars and the influencing
   factors of practice, analysis and determination of academic records.
   Through the analysis of the system business, the demand and function,
   the system composition is constructed. Then, the evaluation system will
   be designed. Through the basic information management, certificate
   management, evaluation management and student academic model design, the
   system design is finished. Finally, the paper analyses the role of the
   evaluation system. The system is able to systematically and standardize
   most of the work in the course, teacher, and academic records management
   workflow. The system not only guarantee the quality of teaching, but
   also make academic records evaluation more effective, more powerful
   process management, and effective communication.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to develop the content and methods, as
   well as the analysis of the approbation of the program of the academic
   discipline ``History and methodology of mathematics{''} for graduate
   students of the Master's program of mathematical program tracks. The
   leading method in the study of this problem was the method of modeling
   the work program of the academic discipline ``History and methodology of
   mathematics{''}, as well as the selection and structuring of the system
   of classes of different types, which allowed us to generate a logically
   constructed course. The structural model of the curriculum ``History and
   methodology of mathematics{''} has been developed and presented; the
   selection and structuring of this course has been carried out, which
   combines such meaningful lines interwoven with time and history as: 1)
   history of mathematics, 2) history of mathematical education, 3)
   philosophy of mathematics, 4) methodology of mathematics; the types of
   classes on selected topics have been offered; the examples of the
   successful implementation of creative ideas are given which can be
   adopted and taken as a basis by other academic researchers. The
   competent teaching of the academic discipline ``History and methodology
   of mathematics{''}, based on the developed work program with the
   application of the proposed forms of classes, broadens the scientific
   horizons of graduate students of mathematical and pedagogical program
   tracks and allows them to focus on educational, scientific and
   methodological types of the future professional activity. The materials
   of the article can be useful for graduate students of mathematical
   program tracks for teaching university teachers of mathematics.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed geometry problems in four middle-grade mathematics
   textbook series from Taiwan, Singapore, Finland, and the United States,
   while exploring the expectations for students' learning experiences with
   these problems. An analytical framework developed for mathematics
   textbook problem analysis had three dimensions: representation forms,
   contextual features, and response types. The results showed that the
   Taiwanese and Singaporean textbooks contained more problems in combined
   form, whereas the Finnish and American textbooks contained more problems
   in verbal and visual forms. The problem distribution across various
   representation forms was more balanced in the Finnish and Singaporean
   textbooks than in the Taiwanese and American textbooks. Most problems
   were non-application and close-ended problems compared to other
   application and open-ended problems. The Taiwanese textbooks contained
   the lowest proportion of real-world problems, whereas the American
   textbooks contained the highest proportion of open-ended problems.
   Implications of this study's findings for textbook developers and future
   research directions are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study provides a conceptual framework for understanding how the
   graduate acquire employability through the social network in the Chinese
   context, using insights from the social network theory. This paper
   builds a conceptual model of the relationship among social network,
   social network learning and the graduate employability, and uses
   structural equation analysis method to conduct an empirical test on the
   theoretical hypothesis, based on a sample of 1468 fresh graduates of
   business discipline from the local university in Zhejiang province of
   China. The findings suggested that social network is one of the
   important platforms for graduate to acquire employability in China, the
   scale of social network, social network heterogeneity and the strength
   of the relationship have positive effects on the formation of graduate
   employability. The acquisition mode of employability based on the social
   network can be divided into imitation learning, communication learning,
   accepting guidance, these three kinds of learning mode have positive
   effects on the formation of graduate employability, and play a mediating
   role in the relationship between social networks and graduate
   employability. University graduate should pay attention to the shaping
   of learning behavior based on social network to improve their
   employability in China.},

Abstract = {A multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approach was proposed in this
   study as a prediction method that differs from the conventional
   production and design methods for a product. When a client has different
   dimensional requirements, this approach can quickly provide a company
   with design decisions for each product. The production factors of a
   product are usually complex and difficult to predict. A focus group that
   comprises seven professional product designers was formed in this study
   to determine those exact assessment criteria based on their practical
   experiences of pneumatic door closer designs. These criteria include
   operability, manufacturability, style, creativity, and cost. We
   recommend using grey-level designs to assess and resolve the product
   design and production planning problems. A case study on pneumatic door
   closers was conducted and a weighted value was assigned to each of the
   assessment criteria. New product series were created for the
   verification of the proposed design approach. In a grey-level design
   assessment, the design ideas of clients and designers are represented by
   grey levels. After that, a grey relational analysis is used to determine
   those factors that are valued by clients for predicting the priority of
   each of the design elements for a product series. The proposed approach
   can assist designers in predicting a product's design quality and
   recommend the optimal alternative within a product series.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the differences between Taiwanese experienced
   and preservice elementary school science teachers' content knowledge
   (CK) about electric circuits and their ability to predict students'
   preconceptions about electric circuits as an indicator of their
   pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). An innovative web-based recruitment
   and data collection technique were involved to purposeful collect
   samples totalling of 76 experienced teachers, 85 preservice teachers,
   and 438 students. Confidence assessment was used to assist in
   identifying alternative conceptions. Results indicated the experienced
   teachers possessed more acceptable CK with higher confidence than the
   preservice teachers. However, both groups' predictions of students'
   conceptions about electric circuits were not significantly different in
   two-thirds of the test items, and their learning experiences were the
   main source used to predict students' preconceptions. This study
   suggests establishing science teacher qualification to enhance
   preservice teachers' CK, and helping both preservice and inservice
   teachers become aware of their students' preconceptions were needed.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the production of a digital environment to foster
   the learning of conics through augmented reality. The name conic refers
   to curves obtained by the intersection of a plane with a right circular
   conical surface. The environment gives students the opportunity to
   interact with the cone and the plane as virtual objects in real time and
   real place. They can perceive their own creation of the different
   curves: parabola, circle, ellipse and hyperbola. A dynamical animation
   to visualize the focus and directrix of the parabola is presented by
   introducing the Dandelin Spheres into the virtual environment. Besides
   the motivational element it offers, the purpose is to promote an active
   learning through the affordances of augmented reality technology.
   Anxiety towards mathematics could be tackled if students comprehend the
   mathematical knowledge. The integration of digital technology in the
   learning process helps this strengthening the development of spatial
   ability in students.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the pedagogical studies of Finnish and South Korean
   physics teacher education programs that guide teacher educators to
   support student teachers' to build readiness for acting as professional
   teachers in a secondary school classroom. Research on the domains and
   origin of teachers' professional knowledge provides a framework for
   analyzing the programs and the potential support of the program for
   becoming a professional teacher. First, the aims of the pedagogical
   studies are categorized, resulting in ten themes that characterize the
   programs. Second, the programs are analyzed in the framework domains of
   teacher knowledge and the origins the knowledge is suggested to learn.
   The domains of knowledge include the knowledge needed in consuming and
   producing educational research, general pedagogical knowledge, and
   pedagogical content knowledge. Distribution among the four domains of
   teacher knowledge varies in Finnish and South Korean programs,
   reflecting the differences in the national education cultures.
   Pedagogical studies in Korean physics teacher education are more
   theoretically oriented than their Finnish counterparts. However, the
   Finnish and Korean programs do bear similarities, such as an emphasis on
   reflection and a research orientation, as a part of their pedagogical
   studies.},

Abstract = {This study used Focus Group to analyze user requirements for user
   interface so as to understand what capabilities of the Collaborative
   Problem Solving (CPS) Instructional Platform were expected by users.
   After 12 focus group interviews, the following four functions had been
   identified as essential to the CPS Instructional Platform: CPS
   instructional models, instructional resources database, evaluation
   system, and instructional plan sharing. The user interface for the CPS
   Instructional Platform were designed accordingly. After programmers of
   the integrated project had completed system development based on the
   design, the study was proceeded usability evaluation of user interface
   of the CPS Instructional Platform. As for the satisfaction survey, 33
   users were chosen based on purposive sampling. In the Likert Scale of
   five levels, the average score of this system was 4.1 by the testers.
   And, it indicated that most users were satisfied with the system user
   interface design and functions.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of motivation to
   learn technology, as perceived by South Korean middle school students,
   on their attitudes toward engineering. Using the instruments of Glynn et
   al. (2011) and Lee (2008), the study focused on eighth and ninth grade
   students in four middle schools located in South Korea's larger cities.
   The study identified a positive correlation between middle school
   students' motivation to learn technology and their attitudes toward
   engineering. Also, the engineering interest was found to be mostly
   affected by motivation to learn technology; and the engineering
   curriculum and engineering consequence, by career motivation. Based on
   the educational implications of these study findings, this essay
   discusses the implementation of engineering in the middle school
   technology curriculum.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate STEAM (Science, Technology,
   Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) teacher education and to examine the
   successful conditions for its implementation. This study observed two
   leading schools that have actively participated in STEAM education since
   the initial stage of STEAM education in Korea. Through participant
   observation, we videotaped actual lessons, interviewed teachers, and
   collected their documents. The data analysis was carried out from a
   community of practice (CoP) perspective and the CoP dimensions were
   categorized as joint enterprise, mutual engagement, and shared
   repertoire. The results show that the two communities shared similar
   dimensions: open-mindedness and self-innovation as joint enterprise,
   reciprocal relationship and continuous role exchange as mutual
   engagement, and educational materials and abundant time as shared
   repertoire. This study gives some practical implications for teachers'
   successful engagement with and for their competency in STEAM education.},

Abstract = {STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), one of the
   mostly emphasized concepts in the world, is a paradigm that creates
   interdisciplinary learning and provides achievement of the outcomes of
   science, mathematics, engineering and technology while doing this. This
   research was carried out to investigate the STEM fields' placement of
   the top thousand students placed in science and mathematics fields in
   universities, the Student Selection and Placement Center (OSYM)
   university placement data as a basis. This is a quantitative research
   and descriptive analysis techniques have been used. In the study, which
   has examined university placement of 17135 students, it was determined
   that as the students' interest in STEM fields decreased between the
   years 2000-2014, the interest in faculties of medicine increased, that
   there is a major difference between male and female students in favor of
   the males, that the students were placed mostly in engineering
   departments among STEM fields and that placement in education faculties
   and fundamental sciences was rather low.},

Abstract = {No matter how fast or wide digital technology develops, because of the
   gap between urban and rural areas, a digital divide in the education
   system still exists. The researcher joined the digital film-making
   summer camp, where the major objective was to decrease the digital
   divide between urban and rural areas. Thirty schoolchildren from one
   primary school in Tainan City, Taiwan, participated in the project as
   research subjects, and were divided into two groups. By implementing
   self-edited digital film making learning materials, questionnaire
   surveys, and performing descriptive statistics analysis, t-test and
   Levene's Test with SPSS software, the study aims to understand the
   schoolchildren's capability in digital imaging, and to discuss their
   learning attitude towards educational activities and feelings during
   filming.},

Abstract = {Producing an animation requires extensive labor, time, and money.
   Experienced directors and screenwriters are required to design scenes
   using standard props and actors in position. This study structurally
   analyzes the script and defines scenes, characters, positions, dialogue,
   etc., according to their dramatic attributes. These are entered into a
   model developed by this research, called animated behavior by
   understanding the script module (ABUSM), which implements a design for
   scenes, props, and role-related databases, producing a corresponding
   picture. Then, through mutual correspondence between attributes, data
   mining theories calculate a module for each character and its
   interactions related to other characters. Finally, these modules are
   rendered into animation. This demonstrates the relationships between
   behaviors through an animation demonstration system. Our research
   results will help nonprofessional theater animation designers, providing
   a reference for designing and modifying scripts through animated
   presentation until they are satisfactorily developed. This reduces the
   cost, time, and labor in recording a drama or producing an animation and
   can serve as a reference or training for nonprofessional screenwriters
   and script designers.},

Abstract = {By focusing on a particular alteration of the comparative likelihood
   task, this study contributes to research on teachers' understanding of
   probability. Our novel task presented prospective teachers with
   multinomial, contextualized sequences and asked them to identify which
   was least likely. Results demonstrate that determinants of
   representativeness (featured in research on binomial, platonic
   sequences) are present in the current situation as well. In identifying
   a variety of context-related features influencing teachers' choices, we
   suggest the context in which tasks are presented significantly
   influences probabilistic judgments; however, contextual consideration
   also provides researchers with potential difficulties for analyzing
   results. In addition, we identify strands for further research of
   contextual influence.},

Abstract = {The school systems of many countries have been pervaded by
   student-centred pedagogy making students' small group discussion a
   common feature of the classroom practice. However, there is a lack of
   studies focussing different modes of discussion for the purpose of
   finding out whether some modes are more beneficial than others. Hence,
   the aim of this study is to explore the underpinnings of student small
   group conversations on Socio-scientific Issues in order to develop an
   understanding of the key aspects of what interrupts or revitalizes the
   conversation. We focus on the importance of attitudes and language use
   for the fate of students' decision-making conversations. Our theoretical
   framework builds on Dewey's notion of Open-mindedness and Bernstein's
   communication codes. Students' use of morals, opinions and agitational
   talk interrupted conversations, whereas new aspects and new perspectives
   revitalized the conversation. Students need guidance to avoid using
   justifications in conjunction with a Close-minded attitude.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to identify the perceptions of the
   efficacy of curriculum development on the part of pedagogical formation
   students, their views regarding their professional attitudes, and their
   attitudes towards the pedagogical formation education they receive via
   distance education. The study sample includes 438 Near East University
   students who received pedagogical formation education via distance
   education. The sample consisted of 235 pedagogical formation students to
   implement the efficacy scale, 290 to implement the attitude scale, and
   73 who took part in semi-structured interviews. In the study, it was
   concluded the students generally perceive themselves as being
   sufficiently prepared in terms of curriculum development. There are no
   differences with regard to the overall professional attitude of the
   students. Students generally reported positive views regarding the
   education they receive.},

Abstract = {Students' difficulty in learning and suitably understanding the concept
   of the algebraic variable has been studied with a number of tools and
   documented for several populations. Little research has been conducted,
   however, using the same tool to explore understanding of the notion
   among populations from different countries in an attempt to establish
   similarities and differences in levels of achievement and difficulties.
   This article discusses the findings of a survey applying a questionnaire
   designed for use with the 3UV model, a theoretical-methodological tool
   for analysing the understanding of algebraic variables and their various
   usages (as specific unknown, as general number, functional). Comparisons
   were drawn of the results of a survey of a population comprising 184
   ninth-year students, 92 in Spain and 92 in Mexico, and 82 Mexican and 85
   Spanish eleventh-year students, all from medium-lower income families
   and attending public schools. The results obtained revealed similarities
   and differences among the groups, providing evidence of the strengths
   and weaknesses of the education system of each country.},

Abstract = {The current study aimed to identify the views of pre-service teachers,
   who attended a primary school mathematics teaching department but did
   not take mathematical modeling courses. The mathematical modeling
   activity used by the pre-service teachers was developed with regards to
   the modeling activities utilized by Lesh and Doerr (2003) in their
   study. The present study was a qualitative case study. Following the
   modeling activity, focus group discussions were conducted with 14
   pre-service teachers who attended a primary school mathematics teaching
   department in the Faculty of Education of a state university. Results of
   the study showed that because mathematical modeling activities are
   related to daily life problems, they facilitate the transfer of
   mathematics to daily life situations, support higher-level thinking and
   provide tangible experiences.},

Abstract = {Many researchers critique that continuing professional development
   programs in Saudi Arabia are neither well organized nor are systematic.
   This study came to assess the impact of CPD opportunities in the country
   to better suit the professional needs of Saudi science teachers and
   support them in implementing the reformed instructional practices. Both
   quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 609 Saudi science
   teachers by means of closed and open ended questionnaire and later
   interviews with 9 teachers. Findings indicated that several Saudi
   science teachers have benefited from participating in the CPD programs
   but have also faced several challenges. Further analysis of the data
   resulted into five major themes; perspectives of participating in CPD,
   features of distinguished CPD programs, perceptions of ways to improve
   the impact of CPD, the impact of CPD on classroom practices, and
   barriers face classroom implementation.},

Abstract = {This study, an education program was developed to improve
   addition-subtraction skills of 6-year old children using educational
   toys and smart boards. The program was implemented with children, and
   its effects on their operational skills were analysed. The study group
   of the research is composed of 90 children who attended preschool
   classes in Konya during the 2011-2012 academic year; 30 of them (13
   females and 17 males) attended an educational program using smart
   boards, 30 of them (16 females and 14 males) attended a program using
   educational toys and 30 of them attended an educational program using
   traditional methods. The results of the study suggest that children
   acquire operational skills at a higher degree through using the smart
   boards and educational toys methods when compared to traditional
   teaching. On the other hand, there is no meaningful difference between
   the smart boards and educational toys methods in terms of acquiring
   addition skills. Yet, in terms of acquisition of subtraction skills,
   there is a meaningful difference in favour of the educational toys
   method.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to draw attention to the informal education
   aspect of the movies shown and to determine the awareness levels about
   physics in movies of a small group composed of university students. That
   is an evaluation had been made among the films dealing explicitly with
   the basic content of physics, except for science fiction movies, and two
   films that attracted great attention in the process notation were
   chosen. In this study, the sample group was composed of six students who
   continue physics education at university and have high academic success
   levels. At the beginning of the sessions, the group had been informed
   about the aim and process of the study. The movies, which were watched
   by researchers and scientifically mistaken scenes had been determined
   beforehand, were then watched in two different sessions together with
   the student group. In each session, students were made to discuss the
   scenes dealing with physics and whether they were consistent or contrary
   to physics rules. The scenes in question were stopped upon the demands
   of students, the time interval of the scene was noted, and the
   discussions were recorded by a voice recorder. The researchers did not
   intervene in the discussions directly, but only canalised students to
   make the discussions deeper when needed. Through this study, it was
   realised that the awareness level about physics in movies of the
   students was quite high. This study is highly important in stressing the
   informal education mission of the movies and students' critical
   questioning of the scientific correctness in the films. This result
   points out that while writing a scenario, scriptwriters should take a
   serious academic consultancy service.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate how international teachers,
   who were from overseas but taught in the United States, rate effective
   teacher qualities in three domains; personal, professional, and
   classroom management skills. The study includes 130 international
   mathematics, science, and computer teachers who taught in a multi-school
   charter school system in south-central America. It was found that
   international teachers perception of effective teachers was similar to
   findings of other research regardless of nationality as long as teachers
   enjoys teaching, explain the materials clearly, and grade student work
   fairly. Univariate ANOVA analysis revealed that international teachers.
   US teaching experience had statistically significant effect on teachers.
   ratings of professional skills. Findings were discussed in light of
   developing more general effective teacher qualities regardless of
   subject matter.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the importance given to astronomy teaching in science and
   physics education has been gradually increasing. At the same time,
   teachers play an important role in remediating the misconceptions about
   astronomy concepts held by students. The present study aims to determine
   the misconceptions of pre-service physics teachers (n=117), pre-service
   science teachers (n=97) and in-service physics teachers (n=174) about
   astronomy concepts using a three-tier test. The Astronomy Concept and
   Achievement Test (ACAT), developed by Trumper (2001a, 2001b, 2006), was
   adapted as a three-tier instrument and used as the data collection
   instrument. The first tier, first and second tier and all three tier
   responses that were obtained from the ACAT were analyzed separately to
   identify misconceptions and to evaluate the respondents. achievement.
   The results showed that the achievement scores of pre-service and
   in-service teachers considerably decreased when the third tier was
   considered. In addition, when the misconceptions of pre-service and
   in-service teachers were determined using all three tiers, they held
   extensive misconceptions especially about the reasons for seasons, the
   Moon's phases, the Moon's phase in the solar eclipse and the Sun's
   position in the sky.},

Abstract = {Studies have not yet consented whether integrating mathematics into
   science would enhance students' learning or confuse their understanding
   of abstract mathematical concepts. In spite of the social need for
   solving social-scientific problems with multiple facets, there has not
   been a holistic integration model of the disciplines. Hence, this study
   aims to propose a theoretical model for curriculum integration of
   mathematics and science (CIMAS) and to examine experts' opinions about
   its educational perspectives. The model captures appropriate topics,
   needs (pedagogical, motivational, and societal), and constraints. In
   spite of the small size of participants-23 mathematics educators in
   Ankara, their diverse integration examples reached to the conclusion
   that all units in the Turkish mathematics curriculum can be integrated
   with physics, chemistry, or biology (e.g., derivative with linear
   velocity, ratio with chemical mixture, and probability with genetics),
   while identifying the most number of examples with physics topics. The
   expert responses consistently clarified that CIMAS would enhance
   mathematics education for the pedagogical, motivational, societal, and
   other needs. However, the integration was also perceived to associate
   with obstacles with teachers, curricula, and facilities for effective
   implementation. Lastly, this study further presents a key discussion on
   how to enlarge the scope of CIMAS in terms of collaboration among
   mathematics educators.},

Abstract = {In this context, several recent studies have focused on the ability to
   understand a problem and difficulties regarding the solving as a means
   of improve students' mathematical problem-solving abilities. Design of
   research explores types and factors of mistakes students in solving
   mathematical problems. The instrument used is problem solving test. Data
   from Indonesia secondary school students (N = 147) who were about 15
   years old were analyzed using theory Newman. Procedure Newman includes:
   reading errors, comprehension errors, transformation errors, process
   skill errors and enconding errors. The results indicate to reading
   errors of 4.35\%, comprehension errors of 17.39\%, transformation errors
   of 34.78\%, process skill errors of 23.91\%, and enconding errors
   19.57\%. Factors errors students' is not to absorb information well, not
   understanding the transformation of the problem, not following the
   material thoroughly, and comprehension mathematical of weak concepts.},

   Research Experiences for Teachers (RETs) for K-12 science teachers. The
   RET program seeks to provide science teachers with research experiences
   so they can provide enhanced science or engineering inquiry experiences
   for their students. One form of RET that focuses on science pedagogy has
   resulted in some promising changes in teachers' thinking and lesson
   design. This case study examines how a cohort of ten secondary science
   teachers' inquiry conceptions and lesson design changed after
   participating in a science pedagogy RET, and analyzes the relationship
   between the components of the program and changes seen in teachers'
   inquiry conceptions and lessons. Significant changes in teachers'
   inquiry conceptions and particularly their lessons were a result of
   teacher adoption of the inquiry-based instructional modeled during the
   science pedagogy RET. A theory of action is proposed for RET design that
   would better promote and support teacher learning and foster changes in
   classroom instruction.},

Abstract = {Rapid development of using information technology in higher education
   contributes not only into its efficiency but also may cause a variety of
   risks affecting implementation of some other educational process
   aspects. Understanding the significance of the risks and their
   subsequent study and assessment allows for timely adjustments in
   implementation of certain informational and educational technologies in
   the educational process. The paper focuses on the issues related to
   identification of the major risks while introducing and implementing
   educational innovations, and those related to introduction of the
   learning management system (LMS) in higher education institutions, their
   impact assessment and influence on the efficiency throughout the entire
   educational process. The results of the study have been summarized using
   risk mapping and sensitivity analysis methods. These methods allowed us
   to visualize the level of each risk distinguished in the study according
   to the degree of its influence on the educational process and
   probability of its occurrence. The study was based on the survey
   findings and students' interviews and aimed to identify whether they
   understand and realize the difficulties and complexities in the
   procedure of innovative technologies implementation by their university.
   The authors have developed a list of risks occurring while introducing
   and implementing innovations in the educational process which in their
   turn will reflect the peculiarities of the higher education institution
   using modern learning techniques. Moreover, the paper discusses the risk
   sensitivity study results. They are presented as an expert appraisal of
   risks related to their influence on the resultant as integrated
   assessment, i.e. the Wheel Model of risk management. In the course of
   the study it has been found that, despite the difficulties of innovation
   implementation, the innovative programs having been introduced improve
   the educational process and ensure appropriate quality of human capital,
   or workforce. Reasonable conclusions from the experience of the state-of
   the art innovation introduction into university teaching-learning
   process confirm its practical significance, its ability to encourage
   university students and increase their participation and independence in
   learning, thus contributing to development of their skills that meet the
   requirements of an economist position and in future will help them be
   successfully engaged into innovation economics. These students' skills
   and competencies meet the requirements of innovative processes in the
   economy, despite the fact that the process involves certain risks. The
   paper materials may be of practical value to professionals involved in
   the development and implementation of innovative educational
   technologies at universities.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between the style,
   concentration, and achievement of students in terms of visual/verbal
   learning when learning conceptual knowledge with the use of mobile
   phones in the classroom. A total of 93 Chinese college students who
   majored in education participated in this study. Two major results were
   identified by combining the methods of correlation analysis and ANOVA
   (oneway, two-way): A significant correlation was found to exist between
   concentration and the delayed post-test. Moreover, a significant
   interaction effects on learning achievement was found in visual/verbal
   learning style and concentration. The implications, limitations, and
   future research plans were presented.},

Abstract = {This study focused on to examine prevalence of nomophobia among
   university students; and the relationship among nomophobia, self-esteem,
   loneliness and self happiness with respect to gender and year of study
   of the university students in Pakistan and Turkey. The study subjects
   consisted of 729 students 368 (50.5\%) of which were from Turkey and 361
   (49.5\%) from Pakistan. The data were collected by using Nomophobia
   Scale (NMP-Q), UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-8), Self-Happiness Scale, and
   Rosenberg' Self-Esteem Scale by the researchers from Pakistan and Turkey
   respectively. The relationship and the effect of each psychological
   structure on nomophobia were examined with multiple linear regression
   model. The difference across the categories of independent variables on
   each of the dependent variables (loneliness, self happiness, self-esteem
   and nomophobia) and on linear combination of dependent variables for
   each country was examined by multivariate MANOVA. According to
   multivariate effects results, the main effect of gender on self-esteem
   and nomophobia was statistically significant which indicates that
   differences between male and female students with respect to self-esteem
   and nomophobia were significant. The study demonstrated differences
   between Turkish and Pakistani students' score on nomophobia, loneliness
   and self-happiness were significant, while difference on self-esteem
   across countries was not statistically significant.},

Abstract = {To gain a better understanding of the landscape of State credentialing
   options related to the teaching of engineering at the K12 level,
   NAE/BOSE commissioned this paper and study that describes this landscape
   and provide relevant details for as many States as it is possible to do
   so. This project includes the taxonomy of the various types of
   credentialing offered by each State, and it defines these different
   types of credentials. A two-phase research method was used in order to
   investigate each State credentialing/certification program. The first
   phase of the method examined each State credentialing/certification
   program through the individual State Department of Education. The second
   phase focused on Career and Technical Education (CTE)
   credentialing/certification programs that contain engineering and/or
   engineering design content. A member check technique was used to help
   improve the accuracy, credibility, validity, and transferability of the
   study. Each State credentialing/certification program was thoroughly
   examined through State Department of Education and CTE teacher
   credentialing pathways. The results indicate that 94.2\% of State
   teacher credentialing/certification programs contain engineering or
   engineering design content; however, 5.8\% of State teacher
   credentialing programs do not include any engineering content. Each of
   these credentialing/certification areas also requires a test that
   contains engineering content.},

Abstract = {It is very important for the teachers to know the sexual abuse and
   harassment as they are people who know and best communicate with the
   individual after their families and to transform the inappropriate
   behaviors of the students towards their personal sexual behaviors,
   against one another or their peers into good behaviors in order to
   prevent future negative effects. Knowing the appropriate and
   non-appropriate sexual behavior of students with mental deficiencies
   will guide the determination of the content of the program. The purpose
   of this study was to examine the opinions of the adolescents with mental
   deficiencies on their in-school experiences and on the in-school
   training and abuse issues. Six teachers who provided education in
   schools of students with mental deficiencies were involved in the
   research. The results showed that teachers had inadequate education
   about sexual education both during university education and in-service
   training, and that the students showed inadequate behaviors in the
   classroom environment due to lack of information and education
   deficiencies. It is also seen that the teachers do no have enough
   knowledge about the mentally retarded adolescents showing proper sexual
   behavior.},

Abstract = {It is the only way for social career development of talents in new
   normal construction to create normal development in university education
   and at the same time it extends the strategic transformation from
   university traditional thinking mode to a new level of social
   development. For the perspective of constitute for university
   educational system, the innovation and development of talent cultivation
   has been the topic of educational development. It also plays a key role
   in talent cultivation. The comprehensive construction of social guiding
   function in talent's development is based on the study of social
   personnel cultivation at universities, which takes subjective social
   talent as fundamental and explores micro elements of guiding function in
   social talent's development. Deep excavation of guiding function and
   usefulness provide strong development precondition for the construction
   of new normal developing university talent's cultivation. Through
   scientific construction of university education, the proportion of
   practical courses, social activities are gradually increasing, and
   therefore, university talent's cultivating mode begins to base on
   talents cultivation with social adaptability and highlights the effect
   of talent's cultivating mode on social development. It is clearer to
   promote social development of university talents and effectively serve
   for talent's social development to make social function more specific in
   the process of developing higher education and the role of social
   development clearer. The research shows that the construction for
   guiding role of talent's social development should stand on the basic
   dynamic of social development to ensure that the substantive
   significance of building guiding function in university talent's social
   development and establish specific path and method to guide talents'
   social value, social psychology and consciousness.},

Abstract = {The penalty type education mode for safety production is lack of
   systematic and comprehensive education thought, education system and
   education measures, which leads to frequent safety accidents. To promote
   the safety education level of China's coal mining enterprises, in this
   study, the government, coal mine enterprises and employees are included
   in the evolutionary game model to explore the game relation and
   evolutionary path of the decision-making behavior among the three
   stakeholders in the safety management and education. It is proved by
   decision-making dynamic replication analysis, strategy evolution
   stability analysis and numerical simulated experiment verification that:
   the decision-making behavior of the government, coal mine enterprises
   and employees is the result of the mutual game playing among the three
   stakeholders. It is impossible for the government to leave alone the
   enterprises adopting the penalty type education mode for safety
   production. The incentive type education mode for safety production
   takes active education thought, education system, education measures and
   so on. It has become an effective driving factor to promote safety
   education level and motivate employees' safety initiative. When certain
   conditions are met, the decision-making behavior of three stakeholders
   of the government, coal mine enterprises and employees can evolve into
   an ideal state. The evolution process of decision-making behavior of
   three stakeholders to the ideal state is influenced by many factors. The
   range of different factors has a differential effect on the convergence
   rate of the three stakeholders to the ideal state.},

Abstract = {Platform owners need to manage its internal cash flow as investments on
   buyer side and on seller side. Investment on buyer side will increase
   using experiences and investment on seller side can create an atmosphere
   of innovation. It is much necessary to allocate and optimize the total
   investment on each side users so as to obtain maximal profit. A
   three-period game model is developed to find the optimal investment
   decision. And during the process, we find that platforms can be divided
   into four kinds as investment non-sensitive platform, Seller-sensitive
   platform, Buyer-sensitive platform, and Investment sensitive platform.
   It is also found that the platform system structure influences the
   distribution of total value on platform owner, buyer side, and seller
   side.},

Abstract = {This article gives an account of Grade 9 learners' understanding of the
   concept of the equal sign and how they move from an arithmetic to an
   algebraic equation. A case study, using a sequential mixed method
   research design, was conducted in a secondary school in Soshanguve, a
   township in Gauteng, South Africa. Out of the 49 learners who wrote a
   test on the concept of the equal sign, eight were selected for an
   interview. The study revealed that Grade 9 learners in this school
   interpreted the equal sign as a `do something' and unidirectional
   (one-sided) sign, not as the concept that represents an equivalent
   (concept of keeping both sides of the equal sign equal) of two
   quantities. The researchers attributed misinterpretation of the equal
   sign to how learners had been taught the concept of number sentences in
   lower grades, where greater emphasis was placed on rules than on the
   meaning of a concept.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to make an evaluation based on opinions of
   teachers and students on the Year 8 visual art curricula implemented at
   the secondary education level in both northern and southern Cyprus
   schools. Ten Year 8 Visual Art teachers from Northern Cyprus (n=10) and
   Southern Cyprus (n=13), and 1200 students from both sides participated
   in this research. Opinions of teachers on the visual art curricula
   gathered through semi-structured interview forms whereas opinions of
   students gathered through the ``Visual Art Curriculum Evaluation
   Scale{''}. The findings of research reveal that the value given to the
   visual art curricula in both communities is low in terms of communal,
   administrative, managerial and senior managerial perspectives.
   Furthermore, the findings indicate that compared to Southern Cyprus,
   there is a further need of financial support, an update and development
   of the content of visual art curriculum implemented in Northern Cyprus.},

Abstract = {As a basic quality requirement for students entering into the workplace
   and the key to construction of characteristic high schools, professional
   concepts can help universities reshape the concept of talent
   cultivation. Starting from the connotation of professional concept as
   well as optimizing and innovating the curriculum system setting, we
   should pay attention to students' subjective initiative in the process
   of cultivation for professional concept. Focusing on the change of
   students' professional position in future and the concept of lifelong
   education, the reform of higher education should actively explore the
   professional concept. Based on employment standard in social enterprises
   and evaluation feedback, we should comprehensively use service of
   personalized education to drive and strengthen the students'
   professional concept. We should also carry out education of traditional
   Chinese moral, spiritual of the times and citizens' moral to effectively
   solve the problems that whom the university students should serve for
   and how to serve; university students should be cultivated to combine
   ``occupation dream{''} with university education to correctly handle the
   relationship between personal career dream and profession. Through
   systematic vocational education, students can choose contents of
   professional education according to their own interests, abilities and
   needs of enterprises and establish their own professional development
   planning to love what they do and try their best to be expert in their
   fields so that they can comprehensively strengthen occupation identity.
   Combining with the professional concept, curriculum system in higher
   education can deepen the comprehension of university students to what
   they have learned, make what they have learned stereoscopical, stimulate
   the students' occupation enthusiasm, encourage students to follow the
   path of professional awareness, career identity, and professional
   personality as well as realize the change from university students to
   career man. In order to establish occupation identity, university
   students should actively establish their plan for career, understand the
   relevant information on work outside the enterprise and establish their
   own career aims to reduce confusion and bewilderment after graduation
   and at last, they can grasp the opportunity in the workplace to get
   occupation power beyond the other people.},

Abstract = {The Internet brings many new challenges and opportunities to traditional
   teaching and learning. It is an inevitable trend to improve the teaching
   efficiency, enhance the attraction of the course and the teaching effect
   by realizing the Hybrid Teaching Model reform from the traditional
   teaching mode to the full use of the network. The teaching of
   ideological and political theory should be more internalized in the
   field of the mind, and more needs to explore new teaching modes suitable
   for young students. The background of this study is the impact of the
   online environment on the various links and teaching methods of
   traditional teaching, and also gives new opportunities for teaching
   reform. Based on the reform of the teaching mode of online courses, the
   paper explores the teaching reform path from the new teaching concept to
   the application of the mixed teaching mode and the method of evaluation.
   More than half of the students were willing to accept the practical
   application of the study and thought it was better, the study showed. At
   the same time, a quarter of the students failed to make full use of
   network course resources, one over ten of the students think network
   curriculum resources still cannot meet the learning needs. The results
   shows that network resources are still need to be further optimized. In
   general, the study follows the trend of network teaching, and its
   application has achieved preliminary results. According to the student
   feedback, there is also the problem of optimizing curriculum network
   resource allocation and resource utilization.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between gifted students'
   academic self-concept (ASC) and academic achievement (AC) in earth
   science with internationally representative high-school students from
   the third International Earth Science Olympiad (IESO) held in Taiwan in
   2009. The results of regression analysis indicated that IESO students'
   ASC was significantly correlated with their AC (R-2=0.53, p<0.01) with
   large effect size, even when compared to other Asian countries such as
   Korea and Japan. It was found that Taiwan's students had the lowest ASC
   and exhibited poor interaction with other IESO students. The unique
   pattern of Taiwanese students exhibited through the 3rd IESO leads to
   the conclusion that: For the top notch gifted students, their social and
   psychological character such as their popularity and interaction skills,
   have much strongly effect on their ASC than cultural factors.},

Abstract = {Model-Based learning is a methodology that facilitates students'
   construction of scientific knowledge, which, sometimes, includes
   restructuring their mental models. Taking into consideration students'
   learning process, its aim is to promote a deeper understanding of
   phenomena's dynamics through the manipulation of models. Our aim was to
   ascertain whether the use of three different types of models, integrated
   into an intervention program whose goal was to teach the ``seismic
   effects on soils and buildings{''}, would influence the learning process
   of graduation students or not. For a better understanding of the
   results, the data were collected and analyzed through a combination of
   methods using, simultaneously, quantitative and qualitative method. And
   results not only confirmed the importance of the use of models, but also
   led us to the conclusion that despite the potential and limitations of
   all three models, mixed models are better for restructuring students'
   mental models and the development of meaningful learning.},

Abstract = {Relevance of the article is caused by need to form the teacher's
   psychological competences on the basis of life and professional
   situations. This article is directed to detection of the main
   difficulties, which students have in the course of studying psychology
   and efficiency of use of video cases at classes of psychology. The
   leading research method of this problem is the reflexive assessment,
   allowed to reveal the main difficulties which are experienced by
   students in the course of studying Psychology and their relation to the
   use of video cases by the specified criteria. In the course of research
   three working methods with video cases were approved: group and
   individual analysis of fragments of feature and animation films;
   selection of fragments from the literary works and films reflecting
   psychological features of children of different age; creation of the
   film about group. In article the content of work with video cases on
   classes of Psychology is disclosed, the main difficulties which are
   experienced by students in the course of studying Psychology, criteria
   for evaluation of work with video cases are revealed, it is proved that
   video cases allow students to understand and solve professional and life
   situations better. Using of video cases in the course of studying of
   psychological disciplines allows students to acquire theoretical
   material, to visualize and solve professional and life situations
   better.},

Abstract = {There has been a worldwide decline in interest and achievement in
   mathematics in young people. Despite the extensive benefits of physical
   activity, the majority of children are not sufficiently active. Schools
   have the potential to arrest both concerns through innovative teaching
   that challenges and complements traditional approaches. The aim of this
   paper is to report student and teacher perceptions of the Encouraging
   Activity to Stimulate Young Minds program, a school-based physical
   activity integration intervention designed to enhance learning and
   engagement in mathematics and increase physical activity levels in
   children using movement-based learning experiences. Four classroom
   teachers were interviewed and 66 students participated in focus groups
   following the 6-week intervention. The program provided positive
   experiences for teachers and students, both in terms of enjoyment and
   engagement, while ensuring high quality learning experiences. Embedding
   movement-based learning across mathematics, had a significant positive
   effect on children's enjoyment and engagement without compromising the
   quality of learning.},

Abstract = {Practical work activities have been used for many purposes in science
   teaching. However, its use for assessment purposes has been limited.
   This study highlights the role of practical work activities in
   assessment. Practical work activities present various advantages as an
   assessment tool. Practical work activities allow the assessor access to
   a variety of knowledge types into a student's knowledge base. That is,
   with practical work activities the student's knowledge and skills may be
   assessed simultaneously. The study uses qualitative methods to ensure a
   broader and deeper understanding of the quality of knowledge structure
   and its functioning that individual students possess. The findings of
   the study demonstrate the extent with which knowledge and/or skills may
   be accessed using practical work activities. In addition, the findings
   illustrate through using practical work activities, the possibility of
   accessing and assessing different types of knowledge and their
   characteristics as possessed by each learner/student. With this
   capability in assessment, teachers are empowered to accurately and
   appropriately plan for future teaching and learning of concepts as they
   will be able to develop relevant teaching and learning materials for
   particular and different cohorts of students.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to analyze the mathematics student teachers'
   solutions on the Esme Rug Problem through 7-stage mathematical modelling
   process. This problem was designed by the researchers by considering the
   modelling problems' main properties. The study was conducted with twenty
   one secondary mathematics student teachers. The data were collected from
   the participants' written solutions related to the problem. To analyze
   the students' answers through mathematical modelling process, the
   researchers compiled 7-stage mathematical modelling process from the
   literature. It was observed that the problem created an appropriate
   process for mathematical modelling. While examining the solutions of the
   participants who were informed about this 7-stage mathematical modelling
   process, it was generally observed that their solution approaches toward
   the problem decreased while progressing in modelling stages.},

Abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) may be used as an innovative educational tool.
   However, in order to fully exploit its potential, it is essential to
   achieve the effect of immersion. To more completely submerge the user in
   a virtual environment, it is necessary to ensure that the user's actions
   are directly translated into the image generated by the application,
   which can be achieved by means of various devices, such as tracking
   systems and VR headsets, as well as haptic devices. Recently, VR has
   become the focus of e-entertainment, which has resulted in the
   appearance on the market of numerous, low-cost peripheral devices. The
   paper discusses the examples of potential applications and steps
   necessary to adapt low-cost devices to immersive educational
   applications.},

Abstract = {The development of student abilities of scientific research activity
   (SRA) in the process of studies appears as a highly important area. In
   the course of studies, students not only increase their general
   competencies, acquire professional abilities and skills but also learn
   to conduct research. This does not mean that all students will build
   their careers in the field of scientific research in the future. The
   present life, labour market, the complexity of technology, etc. require
   at least minimum competencies in carrying out investigation. SRA should
   be universally stimulated and developed. Scientific research activity is
   not an entertainment but responsible, thorough work requiring a lot of
   self-independence. Such activity promotes student analytical thinking,
   the abilities of searching and using information are formed, they learn
   how to analyse the collected material, prepare reports, make research
   presentations, etc. The conducted qualitative research involved
   graduated students - pre-service teachers of sciences studying at
   Lithuanian universities. The research was conducted in January-February
   2016 and based on the constructivist paradigm, suggesting that knowledge
   was not the final or uniform product. Teaching is an effective tool when
   students gain information thus stimulating active cognitive processes.
   The performed research has demonstrated that SRA questions remain
   crucial, the organization of such activity has specific weaknesses and
   improvement is not always carried out deliberately and purposefully,
   because the context, environment, conditions and requirements for
   education in general may differ. Improvement on SRA is not possible
   without empirical data based on the status. The research has revealed
   student understanding of SRA, its key strengths and weaknesses as well
   as allowed assessing the significance of such activity on the
   professional training of the pre-service teacher and on improving
   guidelines.},

Abstract = {To maximize the effectiveness of a decision, it is necessary to support
   decision-making with integrated methods. It can be assumed that
   subjective evaluation (considering only absolute values) is only
   remotely connected with the evaluation of real processes. Therefore,
   relying solely on these values in process management decision-making
   would be a mistake because this might lead to the lack of agreement
   between the criteria of the process. The absolute values of criteria are
   required for decision making, while the integrated criteria evaluation
   is necessary for making consistent decisions, taking into account the
   relative values of the criteria as well.},

Abstract = {Exposing engineering students during their education to real-world
   problems and giving them the chance to apply what they learn in the
   classroom is a vital element of engineering education. The Embedded
   Systems course at Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT) is
   one of the main courses that bridge the gap between theoretical
   electrical engineering education and the real-world. This paper presents
   the experience of applying project-based learning to enhance teaching
   the Embedded Systems course at PSUT. The feedback from students
   illustrated the effectiveness of this method in enhancing the
   understanding and the ability of students in applying embedded systems
   design concepts to solve real-world engineering problems.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on one part of a large study which attempted to
   identify the linguistic and hierarchical characteristics of van Hiele
   theory amongst grade 10 learners. The sample consisted of a total of 359
   participants from five purposively selected schools from Mthatha
   District in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The performance
   of these learners on a written geometry test was analysed. On the basis
   of the analysis, 30 learners were selected to be the subjects for
   interviews. This paper focuses on the analysis of the interview
   transcripts to discern the van Hiele characteristics among learners'
   geometrical tasks. This paper reports particularly on linguistic and
   hierarchical characteristics of the van Hiele theory. The ethical
   requirements were met. The findings from the study affirmed the
   existence of the linguistic and hierarchic characteristics of the van
   Hiele theory.},

Abstract = {Problem solving has been a core theme in education for several decades.
   Educators and policy makers agree on the importance of the role of
   problem solving skills for school and real life success. A primary
   purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of cognitive
   abilities on mathematical problem solving performance of elementary
   students. The author investigated this relationship by separating
   performance in open-ended and closed situations. Findings of the study
   indicated that the cognitive abilities explained 32.3\% (open-ended) and
   48.2\% (closed) of the variance in mathematical problem solving
   performance as a whole. Mathematical knowledge and general intelligence
   were found to be the only variables that contributed significant
   variance to closed problem solving performance. General creativity and
   verbal ability were found to be the only variables that contributed
   significant variance to open-ended problem solving performance.},

Abstract = {Recently, many countries have considered various assessment methods in
   order to measure multiple ways of students' thinking skills and problem
   solving ability. Recently, the Ministry of Education, Science and
   Technology {[}MOEST] (2009) in Korea revised the mathematics curriculum,
   which now more focuses on enabling students to explain mathematically as
   well as to reflect on their thinking. This method allows students to
   express or debate on their own ideas in order to extend their
   mathematical communication skills. The purposes of this study are to
   introduce the background of such implementation of a
   constructed-response assessment in Korea as well as to investigate how
   elementary teachers implement a constructed-response assessment in
   developing and refining a framework. The developed grading rubric for
   the constructed-response problems in terms of a holistic approach was
   introduced. Further, the implication of applying constructed-response
   items to third-grade students in Korea was discussed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the gender
   composition of university physics laboratory groups on student
   self-efficacy and quiz performance. Students from a Chinese university
   was chosen and subdivided into two groups, which were assigned either
   same-sex or coed laboratory teams while executing identical laboratory
   activities and instruction. Assessments were carried out prior to
   instruction and at the end of one semester. Students' self-efficacy and
   scores on laboratory quizzes were assessed. In this study, no
   statistically significant differences for the male students'
   self-efficacy gain and average laboratory quiz scores in the two types
   of team organization were found. In contrast, the female students'
   self-efficacy gain and lab quiz mean scores from same-sex teams were
   higher than ones from coed teams. So it delivered some messages to
   physics instructors and physics education researchers: Single-sex lab
   team education is beneficial for female students.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to understand how students` attitudes were
   connected to their mathematics learning and achievement. This
   investigation of students (n = 78) and their attitudes was specific to
   web-based homework in developmental mathematics courses in a two-year
   community college located in a large urban city in the United States. A
   mixed-methods investigation was utilized to analyze the relationships
   between students` attitudes and their mathematics achievement. The
   qualitative findings from the survey questionnaire show mixed responses
   from participants on the benefits and disadvantages of a web-based
   homework platform. Additionally, quantitative results, represented
   through cluster analysis, show the relationship between three groups of
   students, their attitudes and their mathematics achievement. The results
   of this study suggest that students with lower and average mathematics
   achievement hold more positive attitudes toward using a web-based
   homework platform compared to higher achieving students. Based on these
   results, it can be noted that web-based homework platforms serve an
   important role in student learning and attitudes toward mathematics in
   developmental courses, likely because the immediate feedback given helps
   to improve student understanding.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, outreach labs are important informal learning environments in
   science education. After summarizing research to goals outreach labs
   focus on, we describe our evidence-based gene technology lab as a model
   of a research-driven outreach program. Evaluation-based optimizations of
   hands-on teaching based on cognitive load theory (additional group
   discussions) and on conceptual change theory (consideration of students'
   alternative conceptions) achieved higher instructional efficiencies. We
   argue both modifications as generalizable for science teaching. As more
   general results, we describe identified student cognitive load types and
   problems of tutoring in hands-on teaching. Finally, we present our
   innovative approach of combining student and preservice teacher
   education, theory-based on pedagogical content knowledge by focusing on
   preservice teachers' change from student, to tutor, to teacher roles.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate a typical Chinese high school
   biology textbook using the textbook standards of the American
   Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The data were
   composed of three chapters selected from the textbook. Each chapter was
   analyzed and rated using the AAAS textbook standards. Pearson
   correlations between the chapter ratings and the AAAS textbook standards
   were calculated. Results showed that the chapters meet most of the AAAS
   standards. This paper discussed the weaknesses and strengths of the
   textbook chapters based on the criteria. In general, the Chinese
   textbook was found satisfactory; however, there is still room for
   improvement. The study provides valuable insights and suggestions for
   improving the textbook.},

Abstract = {The Thailand education reform adopted cooperative learning to improve
   the quality of education. However, it has been reported that the
   introduction and maintenance of cooperative learning has been difficult
   and uncertain because of the cultural differences. The study proposed a
   conceptual framework developed based on making a connection between Thai
   cultures and cooperative learning elements, and implemented a
   small-scale research project in a Thai primary mathematics class with a
   teacher and thirty-two Grade 4 students. The results uncovered that the
   three components including preparation of teachers, instructional
   strategies and preparation of students can be vehicles for the culture
   integration in cooperative learning.},

Abstract = {This paper describes and discusses the role of practical work in science
   education in Ireland. The 2002 report of a government Task Force on the
   Physical Sciences, set up to consider the problems facing the teaching
   of the physical sciences in second-level schools in Ireland, has
   resulted in rapid reform of the science curriculum at both junior and
   senior secondary school level. Whilst practical work has a long and
   varied history in science education in Ireland, it was only in 2003 that
   practical work became compulsory with the introduction of a new Junior
   Certificate science syllabus for students in the 12 - 15 year old age
   group. The paper describes the two types of practical work introduced in
   the syllabus and discusses the results of a survey carried out by the
   Irish Science Teachers' Association to ascertain the response of
   teachers to this practical work. Compulsory practical work has also been
   introduced into physics, chemistry and biology at senior secondary
   school level (ages 16 - 18). The paper reports on a research study to
   evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed new assessment model for
   practical work involving the use of a visiting examiner to interview
   students and examine their ability to carry out tasks in the school
   science laboratory. The main finding was that the new model provided a
   more valid and fairer assessment of students' ability in the area of
   practical work.},

Abstract = {In this study, interior spaces in which graphic design is used and seen
   are classified and sampled based on the idea that indoor places may
   reflect the individual and/or the general population. Additionally, in
   this study graphic design analysis of indoor places (photographic,
   illustrative and typographic) is investigated and advices are given. The
   aim is to emphasize the importance of the role of graphic design
   applications, which have an expressionist composition, in the gaining of
   functional and visual comfort and perception of the unseen aspects of
   ordinary places. From the impression gained during research, it is seen
   that graphic design has an effective role on the specification and the
   identification of the items in the place. It is observed that by means
   of the different experience and approach of graphic designers, ordinary
   places transform into places which carry a message or touch on a
   criticism. Furthermore, it is discussed that the effect of an indoor
   place graphic is related to the relationship of that graphic with the
   place itself. Especially, it is mentioned that the architects or
   interior architects who design the place should be in a good
   relationship with the graphic designer. In conclusion a place, which is
   a product of architecture, carries an aestetical and conceptual message
   with the graphic design; this concept leads to the discipline that can
   be named as interior graphics or environmental graphic design.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of high school
   achievements and college entrance examination score on college
   performance of pre-service teachers. To achieve this, the study utilized
   quantitative correlational research design. Data was collected from 205
   pre-service teachers' secondary documents and was analyzed using both
   descriptive and inferential statistics. Thus; as a result, the study
   found that college entrance examination and high school transcript were
   the significant predictors of college level performance and the
   inclusion of college entrance examination to the admission criteria
   raised the predictive power of the selection criteria significantly. The
   study also found that college entrance examination and high school
   transcript were the most significant predictors for both program college
   preservice teachers' performance. Thus; this study recommends further
   research to explore unexplained contributors to college level
   performance of pre-service teachers.},

Abstract = {This research provides the instructional exploration of analytic
   geometry pattern based on van Hiele thinking pattern, and the potential
   of GeoGebra effect on experimental group along with its nested group
   (high and low achievers) in comparison with control group in analytic
   geometry. To investigate the significant effect of GeoGebra, the two
   match groups were constructed on their previous grade-11 mathematics
   records with almost equal statistical background and with the same
   compatibility in the biological age. Further, six-week experiments of 22
   lessons were prepared and two teaching methods (tradition vs DGS aided
   instructions) were tested. Three hypotheses were carried out i.e.
   Treatment does not significantly affect, the two groups in mathematical
   achievement mean scores and, the higher and low achievers of the two
   groups in mathematical achievement mean scores. To measure the treatment
   effect, t-test was used by SPSS. Analyses of the research revealed that
   experimental group performed well, while; GeoGebra was influential in
   favor of low achievers in comparison to control low achievers.},

Abstract = {Using the method that measures regional disparity of economic growth, we
   calculated the SE, CVs and Theil series of regional real estate
   investment to analyze the regional disparity of real estate investment.
   We measured the regional disparity of real estate investment from 1999
   to 2012 among China's economic regions, intra-economic regions and
   cities in the same province in the context of population aging. We also
   made empirical analysis on the relationship between real estate
   investment and GDP using the sample of 231 cities. The result reveals
   that the absolute difference of real estate investment is increased
   yearly and the relative difference is gradually reduced. The difference
   among economic regions or cities in the same province is increasing
   largely year by year, which is the main component of regional disparity.
   Due to the different level of regional economic development, the
   relationship between real estate investment and GDP is varying among
   cities.},

Abstract = {With the continuous development of science and technology, new media
   such as the internet and smart phones has become part of people's life,
   and has gained a fast popularity, especially to university students. The
   emergence of new media will have direct and indirect influence on
   university students' psychological health and bring some unpredictable
   impact. Most of research focused partially on new media or psychological
   health education mode for university students, in order to undertake
   further research and improve related theory, based on the comprehensive
   research of literature review, this paper adopts spass2010 software's
   principal component analysis to deal with the data and analyze the
   received questionnaires, then it compares and discusses the positive and
   negative influence on psychological health education that has been
   brought with new media to university students. On the basis of full
   consideration of real situation, this paper provides some aspects that
   need to be improved on psychological health education mode for
   university students from the perspective of new media, such as the
   construction of comprehensive education system, enriching the education
   content, innovation of education forms and methods, establishing
   high-quality teachers group and improving supervision management system,
   etc. To effectively combine psychological health education with new
   media method, it can enhance the effectiveness of psychological health
   education in university. With the comparison, this paper draws strength
   of new media and proposes some suggestions which are more suitable for
   university students' psychological health education.},

Abstract = {The development of information technology has a positive influence over
   distance education. For instance, it gives birth to E-learning, a novel
   and convenient mode of online learning. However, the existing E-learning
   platforms are often in need of heavy infrastructural investment. To
   solve the problem, this paper introduces the architecture of elastic
   cloud computing to E-learning, and proposes a new load balancing
   algorithm based on elastic cloud computing. Then, it establishes a
   five-layer elastic cloud-based E-learning model for distance education.
   The subsequent evaluation demonstrates that the model can effectively
   respond to the dynamic load imposed on by numerous users, and maximize
   the revenue of the E-learning platform.},

Abstract = {A whole category of engineering and economic problems can be reduced to
   solving a set of differential equations. Downsides of known approaches
   for their solutions include limited accuracy numerical methods with
   stringent requirements for computational power. A direct analytical
   solution should be derived to eliminate such flaws. This research
   intends to derive such a solution for an n-dimensional set of recurrence
   relations for first-order differential equations, linearly dependent on
   the right side. The research methodology relies on successive
   integration of the considered set in view of the initial conditions. The
   overall solution was derived as a sum of products of exponential
   multipliers with constant coefficients that are defined through weights
   of a tree graph, which is a descriptor of successive integration. An
   analytical solution for an n-dimensional set of recurrent differential
   equations in view of the initial conditions has been derived for the
   first time in this research.},

Abstract = {The ideas and principles of synergistic and fractal approaches make up
   methodological provision for the research. An important role is also
   given to methods of system analysis, mathematical and visual modeling,
   experimental and statistical methods. The methodological basis of the
   article is a synthesis of synergistic and fractal approaches. The
   purpose of the article is theoretical underpinning and development of
   effective didactic mechanisms for enhancing pedagogical synergy in
   mathematical education by improving the key components of pedagogical
   process on the basis of the fractal approach. The article presents all
   stages of a technology for enhancing pedagogical synergy in mathematical

Abstract = {University counselors are the main force for university student work,
   their professional ability directly affects the ultimate effect of
   university student work. Therefore, professional construction of
   university counselors has an unignorable optimistic and positive guiding
   effect on management of university students. The professional
   construction of university counselors requires provision of clear
   promotion ways for university counselors, constant exploration into
   theoretical research and practice way of university student work, so as
   to promote improvement in university counselors' comprehensive quality.
   Clear promotion way will stimulate enthusiasm of university counselors
   in student work, so that excellent university counselors specialize in
   professional work of counselor, thus enhancing the overall level of
   university counselors in managing university students. University
   counselors should emphasize the integration of education and management,
   and integrate individual education guidance with group management and
   construction. At the same time, university counselors should not only
   focus on shaping the social mainstream ideology of university students,
   but also take the initiative to study the current life demands of
   university students, integrate social norms into actual life of
   university students, devote to instructing university students to
   develop the basic criteria to follow when dealing with interaction
   between people and society. That is, promote the socialization of
   university students, so that university students achieve better
   socialization in growth and education. The professional ability of
   university counselors should be constantly innovated centering on the
   actual needs of university student management work. Efforts should be
   made to create a model combined with university student work, constantly
   explore the optimization path under the view of university student work,
   and finally make university counselors' professional ability better
   embodied and displayed in university student work.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationships between language learning
   strategies (LLSs) and achievement goal orientations (AGOs) in Taiwanese
   engineering students taking an EFL (English as a Foreign Language)
   class. Fifty freshmen from college of technology in university in
   central Taiwan participated in this study. All of the participants had
   studied English as a foreign language for more than six years. This
   study found that, among six categories of language learning strategies,
   students preferred using social strategies, such as asking for help from
   others while learning English. Students also frequently employed
   compensation strategies when presented with unfamiliar English words.
   Cognitive and affective strategies were the least used. In terms of
   achievement goal orientations, students employed the mastery-approach
   and the performance-approach more frequently than mastery-avoidance and
   performance-avoidance. Finally, a significant correlation was identified
   between language learning strategies and achievement goal orientations.},

Abstract = {Among various types of home appliances, an electric steam iron has a
   higher risk since it needs to operate under a condition with a higher
   range of temperature. In this study, a group of college students were
   invited to operate an electric iron during the experiment in order to
   investigate the correlation between an operator's hand and the possible
   contact with the iron soleplate during usage. The purpose of this study
   was to determine the hand portions which could easily get burned and the
   portions of the iron soleplate which tend to cause injuries. The results
   of this study indicated that the hand portions which could easily touch
   the soleplate are the right-hand side of the thumb and the forefinger.
   On the other hand, the portions on the soleplate which tend to cause
   burns are on the left-hand side of the iron, especially the sharper and
   upper half. The results serve as a good reference for follow-up
   designers on an iron design based on the safety consideration.},

Abstract = {This study combined the attention-relevance-confidence-satisfaction
   (ARCS) motivation model with a game design model to develop a Kinect-
   and game-based interactive learning system to enhance learning
   motivation and effect. In this system, game characteristics incorporated
   into the learning procedure through a game model allowed the learner to
   have fun while learning, and it stimulated their interest in the
   learning activities. A Kinect-based somatosensory interface was adopted
   to enable the learner to control virtual characters by using their
   physical movements. The learning objective investigated in this study
   was to learn about various zoo animals. Sixty adults aged 20-25 years
   were recruited as experiment participants, divided equally between the
   experimental and control groups. Learning effect was analyzed by using a
   t test to compare the participants' performance in tests administered
   before and after one hour of learning. Learning motivation was
   investigated using a questionnaire in which the four elements of the
   ARCS model were adopted as four dimensions of inquiry. Compared with the
   control group, the experimental group achieved a larger test score
   improvement. Analyzing the questionnaire results confirmed that the
   learners had significantly increased motivation across all four ARCS
   dimensions. Finally, learners gave positive evaluations of the developed
   learning system.},

Abstract = {The study compared the students' level of understanding using two
   scenarios i.e. S1 (Classroom Lectures) and S2 (Lectures based on AR). An
   independent sample t-test was applied to correlate the results of two
   groups (experimental and control) and paired sample t-test was applied
   to evaluate the two scenarios S1and S2 within two groups: the
   experimental and the control. When the effect of augmented reality in
   blended learning framework is broke down, it is examined that augmented
   reality learning outperform classroom learning environment in enhancing
   students' performance. The result revealed that there is a difference
   between classroom learning and AR learning. AR experiences have positive
   effect on students' learning. Furthermore, students' confidence and
   motivation towards learning are achieved.},

Abstract = {Should SOEs pay a cost price for the unique advantages of the monopoly
   position they have and the tilting of financial policies? When it comes
   to national participation in profit, the benefit game relation between
   the state and enterprises will pose an impact on dividend benefit of
   nationals and sustainable development of enterprises. Since reform and
   opening up of China, the SOE dividend distribution has gone through
   several reforms. The current profit delivering ratio is lower than 30\%.
   Depending on the nature, period and industry, the different choice
   regarding dividend distribution made by the state and SOEs will pose an
   impact on performance of the transaction cost and operation efficiency
   of the enterprise. Therefore, the enterprise dividend should be
   collected according to their categories reasonably, and the budget index
   should be refined to find a way to return the benefits to nationals.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effectiveness of an integrated context approach
   to the instruction of basic compass-and-straightedge construction. The
   formulation of a perpendicular bisector of a segment was used as a
   knowledge module to guide students from the pre-attention level to the
   elaboration level of information processing. The students were expected
   to select and organize information in their working memory for
   integration with prior knowledge. The knowledge module was presented in
   a multimedia environment using a pre-training and rehearsal approach. In
   immediate and delayed test results, integrated context learning proved
   significantly more effective than the traditional context in preparing
   students to deal with retention problems and transfer problems,
   regardless of the students' prior knowledge. These findings demonstrate
   the effectiveness of integrated context in the instruction of
   compass-and-straightedge construction; however, the factors that
   actually facilitate learning have yet to be fully elucidated.},

Abstract = {Education does more than give students facts; it develops their
   potential and trains them to adapt to and improve their living
   environment. Through education, students formulate informed ideas about
   the interactions between people, things, and the environment. In an era
   of global environmental change, students must understand environmental
   problems and develop the knowledge and skills to help mitigate or solve
   them. The key concepts students learn and the ideas that influence
   students during wetland ecology-based outdoor education courses are thus
   worthy of investigation. This study summarized several key indicators
   through a literature review and an analysis of expert interviews. The
   literature review revealed nine indicators: ecological conservation,
   natural environment, biological habitat, individual development,
   environmental education, learning through practice, social culture,
   economy, and environmental quality. An expert questionnaire was used to
   apply interpretive structural modeling and integrate correlations among
   the indicators. Subsequently, the analytic network process was employed
   to establish the weights of assessing indicators. This study defined key
   indicators and provided analysis of the weighted results. These findings
   give teachers an academic basis for enhancing the design of related
   teaching curricula to achieve their teaching goals effectively.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of online communities of practice (CoPs), how
   to identify key knowledge spreader (KKS) in online CoPs has grown up to
   be a hot issue. In this paper, we construct a network with variable
   clustering based on Holme-Kim model to represent CoPs, a simple dynamics
   of knowledge sharing is considered. Kendall's Tau coefficient is used to
   investigate the effectiveness of four typical KKS indicators from a
   network perspective. We also examine the relationship between knowledge
   acceptance rate (KAR) of members in CoPs and the effectiveness of
   indicators. The results conclude that variable clustering will lead to
   unstable fluctuation of the effectiveness of KKS indicators, and the
   change of KAR during knowledge sharing will lead to effectiveness of KKS
   indicators fluctuating with a U-shape. The conclusion suggests that
   indicators should be used under suitable conditions in practice to
   improve the efficiency of knowledge sharing.},

Abstract = {Motivation to learn is an essential element in science learning. In this
   study, the role of career motivation in science learning was examined.
   In particular, first, a science motivation model that focused on career
   motivation was tested. Second, the role of career motivation as a
   predictor of STEM track choice was examined. Third, the effect of gender
   and academic year on science motivation was explored. The participants
   of the study were 626 high-school students. We used the Rasch analysis,
   structural equation modeling, logistic regression, MANOVA for the
   statistical analyses. It was found that career motivation has direct
   influences on several motivational factors in science learning, such as
   grade motivation, need for learning, self-determination, and
   self-efficacy. Moreover, career motivation was found to be a predictor
   of students' STEM track choice. Finally, there were substantial
   differences in science motivation across gender and academic years.
   Generally, females and students in higher academic years exhibited a
   lower level of science motivation. Female students especially showed a
   low level of career motivation. The findings suggest that it is
   important to facilitate students' career motivations to improve their
   science motivation and promote long-term scientific achievement.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a mechanical critical thinking
   scale for high school students. A stratified random sampling method was
   used to establish the norms. After pre-tests and item analysis, the
   scale was determined to have five subtest sections (i.e., recognition of
   assumptions, induction, deduction, interpretation, and evaluation of
   arguments) consisting of 25 items. In addition, using 1,954 high school
   students as participants, this study established a norm and investigated
   the differences among genders and ages. The results showed that male
   students had better mechanical critical thinking skills than did female
   students in terms of induction aptitude, while female students were
   better in evaluation aptitude. In addition, the mechanical critical
   thinking performance of 12th-grade students was superior to that of
   10th- and 11th-grade students.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this research is to determine the feasibility of
   using a multi touch tabletop system for applied mathematics learning in
   primary education with students with special needs (SEN). The
   instructional content designed on the tabletop focuses on understanding
   and managing money, coins, and banknotes. The study also analyzes the
   impact of this technology on students' motivation. The tabletop system
   was used in a real educational setting, where we compared the learning
   experience of the students before and after using the tabletop. The
   evaluation method focused on three elements: the increase of knowledge,
   the relationship between the acquired learning depending on the
   educational level and the type of educational needs, and the student's
   satisfaction and motivation after using the tabletop. Our results reveal
   that the tabletop is a feasible technology that can be successfully
   applied in special educational needs contexts.},

Abstract = {MOOCs social media has appealed to most instructors and learners like
   strong magnets by using ubiquitous handheld devices to share and discuss
   films, pictures, and messages. Through the social platform, users can
   share, track, and search for the information of their specific
   interests. Thus, they can make interactive discussions as well as social
   learning on multimedia texts and learning materials. It provides
   teachers and students the social platform to express opinions or ask
   questions. We developed an assistant system to help students evaluate
   problems and solutions is an emerging issue, and the MOOCs social
   searching system is a key solution. We report a case study that focuses
   on MOOCs learners' social searching results and its influence on
   learning behaviors and learning outcomes. A case study was carried out
   with 36 high school students in Northern Taiwan. Results show that the
   mechanism benefits student information gathering and improves learning
   performance.},

Abstract = {This study explores the effect of a history-based course on pre-service
   teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT). Data were collected
   from 10 pre-service teachers at a normal university in China. At the
   beginning of the course, participants were asked to submit their
   teaching plans followed by a teaching simulation on selected topics.
   They then received a history-based course particularly stressing the
   value of the history of mathematics in education. After being educated
   on the historical background of these topics, the participants were
   asked to think back while watching their simulation videos and then
   redesign their instructional plans on the same topics. We investigated
   these pre-service teachers' MKT through the simulated teaching videos,
   conducting semi-structured interviews, and analyzing their teaching
   plans and learning journals. Results suggest that these pre-service
   teachers' MKT had improved. Their changes in PCK were more significant
   than those in SMK. Nevertheless, the history-based course seemed to have
   had less influence on the participants' CCK and KCC. Possible reasons
   for the positive and negative effects are addressed.},

Abstract = {Students use concrete manipulatives to form an imperative affiliation
   between conceptual and procedural knowledge (Balka, 1993). Hence, it is
   necessary to design specific mathematics manipulatives that focus on
   different mathematical concepts. Preservice teachers need to know how to
   make and use manipulatives that stimulates students' thinking as it is a
   crucial competency, which they will need during their careers. The goal
   of the present study was to investigate the manipulative material design
   processes of preservice mathematics teachers. Data were gathered by
   using interviews and questionnaires to explore how the preservice
   teachers devise new manipulatives. It was concluded that the preservice
   mathematics teachers are struggling to develop new ideas for an
   appropriate manipulative material design. They encountered structural
   difficulties when they attempted to transform their ideas into concrete
   models. Moreover, their ideas and designs sometimes can be very
   different from manipulatives designed by experts.},

Abstract = {This study examined teachers' perceptions and practices of science,
   technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education in
   South Korea, drawing on a survey of teachers in STEAM model schools.
   Results showed that the majority of Korean teachers, especially
   experienced teachers and male teachers, had a positive view on the role
   of STEAM education. At the same time, Korean teachers highlighted
   various challenges in implementing STEAM education, such as finding time
   to carry out STEAM lessons, increased workloads, and lack of
   administrative and financial support. Our findings suggest that
   sufficient support from the government, the reconstruction of national
   curriculum, and significant changes in the national assessment system
   are needed to better promote STEAM education.},

Abstract = {During the last decade, environmental issues have become a global
   concern. According to a report by the Taiwan Environmental Protection
   Administration, more than 95\% of consumers prioritize purchasing green
   products. Therefore, enterprises should consider environmental concerns
   in their operational strategies. This study identified how enterprises
   can successfully operate green brands, and focused on enterprises
   manufacturing daily necessities. Through a literature review, rules and
   an operational strategy were derived. Subsequently, 6 experts were
   interviewed and completed a questionnaire, then analytic hierarchy
   process was used to obtain the key success factors of green brands
   selling daily necessities. The resulting 10 key success factor findings
   provide a reference for enterprises seeking to act with social
   responsibility; develop high-quality green products, brands, and
   services; and protect the environment.},

Abstract = {The most common way to grade students in courses at university and
   university college level is to use final written exams. The aim of final
   exams is generally to provide a reliable and a valid measurement of the
   extent to which a student has achieved the learning outcomes for the
   course. A source of uncertainty in grading students based on an exam is
   that such exams only consist of a limited number of exercises. We
   investigate the extent of this uncertainty by means of a statistical
   analysis of the results of 23 different examinations taken by 2788
   students. The amount of uncertainty is substantial and typically ranges
   over three grades. Increasing the duration of the examination decreases
   the uncertainty, however.},

Abstract = {Under the waves of the Internet and the trend of era, information
   technology is a door connecting to the world to generate the multiplier
   effect of learning. Students' learning should not be regarded as the
   tool to cope with school examinations. The frequent contact with
   computers, networks, and relevant information allow students enjoying
   the colorful life. Some knowledge is broad on the Internet or TV media
   that the attraction of learning environments and teaching materials for
   students' interests to achieve the teaching effect becomes a primary
   issue.
   With the design of experiments, the quasi-experimental research is
   preceded in this study. Total 92 students in two classes in Fuzhou No. 1
   High School in Fujian are preceded the designed teaching program of
   multi-sensory instruction in math for 4 months. The results show
   significant correlations between 1.learning motivation and learning
   outcomes, 2.multi-sensory instruction and learning motivation, and
   3.multi-sensory instruction and learning outcomes. This study expects to
   understand the effects of multimedia information technology integrated
   multi-sensory instruction on students' learning motivation and outcomes
   as well as provide reference for teachers applying information
   technology integrated instruction and the promotion of relevant
   education units.},

Abstract = {Students grown up with digital technology and Internet are called
   digital natives or net generation. All others, who grew up without so
   much immersion with digital technologies are called digital immigrants.
   Researchers held different ideas on whether a new generation of learners
   existed. One of the foci of the debate is on the appropriateness of
   using age as the criteria to divide ``digital native{''} and ``digital
   immigrants{''}. In order to reconcile the debate, the term ``digital
   learner{''} was used in this paper, with the hypothesis that the time
   length for using technology could be used as the criteria for dividing
   digital learners. It is also noticed that there were few studies focused
   on the learning preferences of today's learners in Chinese context. In
   order to understand learners' learning preference and test our
   hypothesis, a large-scale survey with 44470 participants and 7 focus
   group interviews were conducted with 28 participants. Results showed
   NetizenYears that indicated the number of years passed since he/she
   first time got online could be used as the criteria of digital learners.
   Digital learners could be labeled as 1-NetizenYear digital learners,
   2-NetzizenYears digital learners, and so on, and non-digital learners
   are those with 0 NetizenYear. Results revealed that non-digital learners
   and digital learners had significantly different Internet use patterns.
   More positive attitudes to Internet, more active participation online
   and more tendency to Internet addiction were found for digital learners
   with increasing NetizenYears. The gap between digital learner's
   preferred learning approach and teaching methods in classroom was
   discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion on using the time
   length of using technology as the criteria for digital learners.},

Abstract = {In the official curriculum documents of many countries, statistical
   thinking have become part of the mainstream in school curriculum. We
   argue that teacher capacity is a key dimension in realizing essential
   goals for developing students' statistical literacy, reasoning and
   thinking in practical teaching. In this paper, a construct of Teacher
   Capacity was used to analyze how Australian and Chinese teachers
   understand and give effect to content in ``Statistical thinking{''}. The
   responses of the 82 teachers involved in the study to a questionnaire
   were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of four criteria
   which form the basis of our construct of teacher capacity: Knowledge of
   Mathematics, Interpretation of the Intentions of the Official
   Mathematics Curriculum, Understanding of Students' Thinking, and Design
   of Teaching. These analyses gave rise to three classifications of
   Teacher Capacity: High, Medium and Low Capacity. Australian teachers
   performed slightly better on all four criteria than Chinese teachers,
   but there did not exist statistically significant difference. Among the
   four criteria, Design of Teaching appears to be the critical dimension
   for the implementation of curriculum reform.},

Abstract = {Education has traditionally focused primarily on content and cognitive
   goals. While content knowledge is important, to enter to the labour
   market today, graduates must also develop manual skills and technical

   Slovenia. It portrays the problem of the decline in interest in
   technical studies, seeks reasons behind this and advances proposals for
   improving the situation. The main goal of our research is the wish to
   identify and explore potential epistemological obstacles to a better
   appreciation of STEM education among lower secondary school students,
   and to offer solutions to the problem. The results of the study showed
   that practical and hands-on activities are, to a large extent, lacking

Abstract = {Research results demonstrate that there is a gap between educational
   research and practice. Turkey is not an exception in this case. This
   study aims to examine to what extent and how educational research and
   resources are being followed, understood and used in classroom practices
   by science teachers in Turkey. A sample of 968 science teachers working
   at junior high schools in Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey was
   surveyed. The data were collected through a questionnaire consisting of
   multiple-choice and open-ended questions. The results indicate that the
   most common sources of information used by teachers to follow
   educational research are ``internet{''}; ``radio{''}, ``television{''}
   and ``newspapers{''}; `` scientific magazine journals{''}; and
   ``educational books{''} respectively. In contrast, the least followed
   sources of information used by teachers are ``educational symposiums,
   conferences and workshops{''}, and ``educational scientific journals{''}
   and ``dissertations{''}. 18.7\% of science teachers stated that they
   could understand scientific educational research. Science teachers'
   level of applying the educational research results into practice was
   found as 5.7 \%.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an
   online automated evaluation and feedback system that assessed students'
   word processing assignments prepared with Microsoft Office Word. The
   participants of the study were 119 undergraduate teacher education
   students, 86 of whom were female and 32 were male, enrolled in different
   sections of Computer-I course taught at one of the major public
   universities in Istanbul, Turkey. A total of 52 and 67 participants were
   assigned to the control and experimental group, respectively. No
   statistically significant difference was found between the experimental
   and control group students' post-tests performance, self-efficacy
   perception and technology acceptance scores after the implementation in
   which the experimental group students used the online automated
   evaluation and feedback system to get feedback on their assignments, and
   the control group students didn't receive any feedback. However, the
   interview results showed that the experimental group students had
   positive experiences with the system such as contributions to their
   learning performance, high perceptions, easy use of the system and
   saving time for the assignments.},

Abstract = {Currently not many people would doubt that computers play an essential
   role in both public and private life in many countries. However,
   somewhat surprisingly, evidence of computer use is difficult to find in
   German state schools although other countries have managed to implement
   computer-based teaching and learning in their schools. This paper
   attempts to understand the reasons for this phenomenon and to show that
   more research and development on computer-based teaching and learning
   should be done. It starts with some comments on the importance of
   computer-based learning, followed by a description of the development of
   ICT in education since the 1990s in Germany and the general situation at
   public schools. After focusing on the frame of educational policy in
   Germany, the situation in schools, including the person of the teacher,
   is then reflected upon and compared to the situation in other countries.
   Finally, current developments of computerbased learning in chemistry
   education in Germany are discussed and a frame of further research is
   proposed.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effect of using a non-traditional writing
   task and different audiences on 9th grade students' conceptual
   understanding of a chemistry unit on mixture. 524 students instructed by
   3 chemistry teachers in 2 public high schools participated in this
   study. Upon completion of the mixture unit, 181 students engaged in
   traditional writing activities, 121 students wrote a letter to a younger
   audience, 92 students wrote a letter to their peers, and 130 students
   wrote a letter to their teacher. Mixture achievement test was
   administered as a pre- and posttest to all the groups to assess
   students' understanding of mixture concepts. Semi-structured interviews
   were conducted with 24 students from the non-traditional writing group
   at the end of the instruction to understand students' ideas about
   non-traditional writing task. Posttest analyses indicated that
   non-traditional writing group outperformed the traditional writing
   group, and the groups that wrote to peers and younger students performed
   better than those that wrote to the teacher, when the effects of the
   pretest scores were controlled. The results also showed that students'
   performance on the writing task significantly differed with respect to
   the audience. Moreover, interview results revealed that non-traditional
   writing tasks were very helpful in students' understanding of the
   mixture concepts.},

Abstract = {Mathematics learning and achievement is one area of research that has
   gained momentum in recent years because of its importance as a subject
   in the school curriculum and its usefulness as a prerequisite for
   developing the quantitative and analytical skills. However, studies on
   factors affecting mathematics achievement in Malaysia are limited both
   in terms of the number as well as the scope. It is the aim of this study
   to take a closer look at the relationship between student and background
   factors and mathematics achievement among secondary school students in
   Malaysia using the most recent Trend in International Mathematics and
   Science Study (TIMSS) 2007 data. The results suggested that female,
   educational resources, students' attitude, homework and school
   environment have significant positive effect on mathematics performance.
   The two factors having opposite effects are age of the students and
   language spoken at home. Mathematics performance is found to decrease
   with increasing age and students who did not speak the language of the
   test at home have significantly higher scores than those who did. These
   results have important implications especially for educators and policy
   makers as well.},

Abstract = {Electronic learning (e-learning) adoption has always been a challenge
   for developing countries which is often stunted by the facilitating
   conditions as well as the resistance of both the professionals and
   students. Two-step research methodology is applied in private
   Universities of Northern Iraq by utilizing a hypothesized model of
   technology acceptance model (TAM). First, the readiness factors were
   investigated through University staff by analysing 516 participants. As
   the second research objective, the intention of students is explored
   with 256 valid respondents in these Universities. Data were obtained
   from seven private Universities' staff and students via a paper based
   quantitative survey. Respondents were selected based on the convenience
   sampling method, where researchers visited Universities during the
   semester with permission of their administration bodies. The findings
   reveal that the lowest value was for human resource readiness factor.
   Cultural acceptance, both from education providers' and students'
   perspective, is quite crucial in order to have a sustainable e-learning
   applications. From a technical point of view, our findings also confirm
   the importance of the technological readiness and the main TAM
   constructs of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness
   (PU). Therefore, management of the Universities need to ensure that
   selected systems adequately address these issues.},

Abstract = {144 children aged 5 to 12 years made initial predictions about the
   speeds of a heavy and a light ball rolling down a slope. They were then
   asked to consider how changing the incline height would impact the
   initial predictions. The findings illustrate a shift from rigid
   differentiation to more flexible knowledge structures. While perceptions
   changed with increasing age from light-as-faster to heavy-as-faster,
   younger children were also less likely to believe that any other incline
   steepness could conceivably lead to a different outcome. Older children,
   on the other hand, showed a heightened awareness of how changing incline
   heights could allow for alternative motion patterns. The study adds to
   current understanding of conceptual development. It expands on the
   debate between knowledge-in-pieces and knowledge-as-theory, concluding
   within its constrained scope that development of scientific knowledge
   about object motion possibly occurs in a transition from pieces to
   theory. Consequentially, the paper also considers implications for early
   science education.},

Abstract = {This study aims to emphasize that the realization of effective
   educational approaches depends on the design of spaces suitable for the
   determined philosophy, and to reveal the design decisions required by
   the Montessori educational approach. A three-step method was followed in
   the line of the aim of this study. The first step is to acquire
   theoretical knowledge about the Montessori educational approach. The
   second step is to perform a spatial analysis based on the obtained plan
   schedules and visual materials from the school samples that have adopted
   the Montessori educational approach and designed by the designers
   according to this approach and the final step is to bring design
   decisions to designers and educators in order to create educational
   environments for the Montessori educational approach, depending on the
   literature and school analysis. In the study, it is observed in
   Montessori educational approach that the relationship between interior
   and exterior spaces is very important, that the circulation spaces and
   classrooms are designed as flexible multipurpose spaces depending on the
   basic principles of freedom, socialization, and that child-scale design
   and natural light are extremely important for all of the areas in
   question. It is seen that the Montessori approach is influential on
   educational spaces and the presence of spaces embodying this approach
   has a correspondence in architecture. In this context, this study, which
   reveals the relationship between learning environments and learning
   efficiency, is considered to be a source of data for the schools to be
   designed in this direction.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to examine how Korean and Japanese
   elementary mathematics textbooks series present division in terms of the
   perspective of making connections. For this purpose, units dealing with
   division of whole numbers, fractions, and decimal numbers were analyzed
   with foci on the meanings of division and procedures of division.
   Findings showed that, in the textbooks of both countries, the various
   meanings of division were consistently applied not only to whole numbers
   but also to fractions and decimal numbers. Moreover, the procedures of
   division were connected as numbers were expanded from whole numbers to
   fractions. Noticeable differences included: as for the organization of
   the contents of division, Korean textbooks presented division of
   fractions first, whereas Japanese textbooks dealt with division of
   decimal numbers first. Regarding the meanings of division, the Korean
   textbooks dealt mainly with partition and measurement division
   situations, while the Japanese counterparts were more inclusive with
   multiple situations, such as determination of a unit rate. This study is
   expected to provide information on how Korean and Japanese textbooks
   present division and to give implications for textbook developers and
   teachers to connect division meaningfully as students deal with whole
   numbers, fractions, and decimal numbers.},

Abstract = {At present, to enhance students' innovative ability is an important
   research topic to engineering education. Although engineering students
   can learn hard engineering techniques step by step through instilled
   teaching methods, process-based learning methods as well as formulated
   learning, but there is no conducive to idea generation and creativity
   promotion. While art has the characteristics of raising questions and
   breaking the existing thinking, this paper hopes to cultivate students'
   ability of divergent thinking and enhance their creativity through the
   implantation of art. In this study, we introduced CAPE teaching
   strategy, adopted a curriculum of a Taiwan university of science and
   technology, used case study as main study method to explore art-infused
   engineering teaching methods and teaching contents. There are four
   stages of CAPE: inquiry, cooperation, record and reflection. The results
   show that: (1) The art teachers' teaching contents are corresponding to
   the divergent thinking categories (Khandwalla, 1993). (2) Classroom
   contents enables engineering teachers to focus their teaching from

Abstract = {The application of ``effective teaching{''} theory in higher education
   can be described by four indicators of student development and progress,
   teaching income, reflective teaching and innovative thinking. Foreign
   scholars believe that the ``effective teaching{''} theory can promote
   higher education and has a positive effect to enhance students' learning
   ability. In China, the application of this theory in higher education is
   still at the surface stage, the relevant scholars believe that the
   theory can promote the curriculum reform of higher education. This paper
   introduces the BBM principle, carries on the structural thinking to the
   four indexes of the students' development and progress, the teaching
   income, the reflective teaching and the innovative thinking. It took 100
   university students as the survey object, the four indexes were taken as
   the main variables respectively, and the impact on primary and secondary
   variables on ``effective teaching{''} theory in the case of higher
   education were analyzed. During the study, 100 university students were
   as the data mining, and always remain unchanged, so that the indicator
   is a major variable, that is, to make the indicator as a self-treatment.
   Through the discussion of the results of the four groups, it is found
   that no matter which of the four variables as the main variable, the
   main variables have a major effect on the application, and the secondary
   variables have a secondary effect on the application. According to the
   results, it is concluded that in order to strengthen the application of
   the theory of ``effective teaching{''} in higher education, it should be
   under the premise that remaining three indicators unchanged, and
   strengthen the conclusion of the other indicator. Through this analysis,
   we deepen the depth of the application of the theory of ``effective
   teaching{''} in higher education, and contribute to the promotion of
   higher education level in our country.},

Abstract = {This study proposes and tests a theory of the effects of competition
   network structure and competitive behavior on customer performance.
   Competition networks are defined as the patterns of interdependence
   between rivals that emerge from direct competition. We propose that the
   size, density and heterogeneity of competition networks influence
   customer performance in a systemic way. The results show that network
   size and network density positively affect customer performance, and
   network heterogeneity has no effect on the customer performance. We also
   validate the partial mediation role of competitive behavior in the
   process of competitive network structures affect the customer
   performance. We test our hypotheses in a unique dataset drawn from the
   Chinese service industry in Beijing and Shanghai.},

Abstract = {An evaluation on high-tech enterprise research and development (R\&D) is
   of great necessity for boosting innovative economy and high-tech
   industry in the era of knowledge economy. However, high-tech enterprises
   cannot fully understand their partners' R\&D capabilities and
   cooperative tendencies due to information asymmetry. Driven by interest,
   opportunistic behaviors might emerge, reducing trust and affecting
   efficient R\&D cooperation. To explore R\&D partners' credibility and
   avoid opportunistic behaviors, this study establishes an evaluation
   index system on the credibility of high-tech enterprise partners based
   on literature extraction and law relationship. The SPA-Markov Model has
   been adopted to dynamically evaluate the credibility in knowledge
   collaboration. Finally, HS, the China FAW Tooling Die Manufacturing's
   partner, is case-studied to verify feasibility of the model. The results
   are as follows: (1) Social environment, partner competence, partnership
   and collaborative potential are key indexes measuring partner
   credibility. (2) The SPA-Model Model could figure out changes and trends
   of the credibility. (3) The credibility of high-tech enterprise partners
   might fluctuate in collaboration. According to the study, the SPA-Model
   Model is feasible for assessing the credibility, which makes up for
   static evaluation and provides novel ideas on evaluation and
   optimization of high-tech enterprise partners.},

Abstract = {The super efficiency DEA model and panel Tobit model were used in this
   study to conduct empirical research on innovation performance and its
   influencing factors in expansive companies based on patent and annual
   report data for A-shares, dilated listed companies in China from 2009 to
   2015. Our results suggest that innovation performance in Chinese listed
   companies is generally stagnating at a low level, but scores for
   computer, communications equipment, electrical machinery, chemical, and
   pharmaceutical industries are high. There are significant differences in
   innovation performance between internal and external expansion
   companies. The internal expansion scale shows a significant negative
   correlation with innovation performance, while there is a ``U{''} shaped
   nonlinear relationship between external expansion and innovation
   performance; the turning point appears when the external expansion scale
   is 0.2, that is, it is significantly negative to innovation performance
   below 0.2 (and vice versa). Firm age, firm size, executive pay, average
   age of executives, and depreciation have a negative impact on innovation
   performance, while equity concentration, capital intensity, and
   financial leverage have a positive impact on innovation performance.},

Abstract = {At present, the practice development of massive open online Courses
   (MOOC) is prior to the theoretical research about MOOC in academic
   circles. Through document analysis, participant observation and case
   analysis of MOOC, we find that the connotation of MOOC is mainly
   annotated from three dimensions: curriculum form, education model and
   knowledge innovation. According to the learning theory and teaching
   practice of MOOC, the teaching mode of MOOC is divided into three kinds:
   MOOC based on content, MOOC based on network and MOOC based on task.
   Compared with the traditional courses, MOOC has intrinsic
   characteristics such as large scale, openness, networking, personalized
   and participation, which includes the online learning effectiveness, the
   mastery learning, the interactive cooperation and the learning mechanism
   of complex system self-organization core. Through the analysis of MOOC
   learning mechanism, goal, characteristics and advantages, according to
   the investigation on the use of MOOC at home and abroad, combined with
   the characteristics of computing discipline, the two aspects of MOOC
   teaching function: one is to use the learning records on MOOC to study
   pedagogy, and create new educational theory; another is to use MOOC for
   the flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {Based on resource dependence theory and organizational ecology by
   conducting literature review and theoretical analysis, we constructed an
   indicator system of how the growth of enterprises affects the regional
   environment. We selected large-scale industrial enterprises and
   small/medium industrial enterprises from 2007-2011 with five years of
   data from 29 provinces and cities in China to perform a comparative
   analysis. A correlation analysis shows that (1) natural resource \&
   infrastructure environment, business environment, human resource
   environment, social \& cultural environment, science \& technology
   environment, political environment have an influence on enterprise
   growth, but show some differences; and that (2) partial correlation and
   regression analysis show that natural resources \& infrastructure
   environment and business environment have a very significant impact on
   the results for the two types of enterprises. The human resource
   environment and social \& cultural environment have no significant
   impact on the results for the two types of enterprises. Science \&
   technology environment in large-scale industrial enterprises have a
   better positive impact than in small/medium industrial enterprises. In
   contrast, political environment in small/medium industrial enterprises
   have a better positive impact than in largescale industrial enterprises.},

Abstract = {Objective: China's relevant departments carried out investigation on
   physique and health conditions of all students in 2010. Result indicated
   that physical health conditions of China's University students were so
   bad that should attract people's attention as the students had important
   social roles. Research methods: in this paper, Anhui Agricultural
   University students' physique test data in 2016 was used as research
   evidence; literature consultation, questionnaire survey, logistic
   analysis, mathematical statistics etc. were applied to analyze the
   University students' physical health conditions and problems in students
   of Anhui Agricultural University. Research results: Physical health
   conditions of Anhui Agricultural University students were generally
   qualified, however the levels were lower, excellent rates were not high,
   and the development was imbalanced. We should improve school's physical
   education courses, increase class hour and set up health care course and
   physical education theoretic course to improve students' sports and
   cultural accomplishments; we should make a scientific and reasonable
   assessment on physical education and focus on students' individual
   development; we should improve organization and management of school's
   physical exercises and cultivate student's interest in physical
   exercises; we should constantly perfect sports sit facility's
   construction, utilize current sports sites facilities in a scientific
   and reasonable way and strengthen multi-function development of
   stadiums' facilities.},

Abstract = {Due to the rapid progress of information technology and the Internet
   generation of students now on campus, game-based learning (GBL) has
   become an important issue with regard to education. In addition, in an
   increasingly competitive work environment, students need to cultivate
   not only their own abilities, but also the ability to collaborate with
   colleagues after graduation. However, such collaboration needs to be
   directed by appropriate guidance in order to demonstrate the expected
   results, and the rules of the related game guide can be applied to
   achieve this. Therefore, it is of interest to analyse students' learning
   processes in a digital game with a collaborative learning environment.
   In this study, we designed a digital history game providing
   collaboration opportunities for learners to solve problems. The partial
   least squares (PLS) approach was applied to analyse the effects of this
   collaboration on the attitude towards and willingness to use game
   learning, in order to validate our research model.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of an integrated mathematics and science
   curriculum with life-skills applications on academic achievement in a
   Saudi Arabian elementary school. An integrated unit was developed
   covering the grade 5 `sound and light' science unit and the `perimeter,
   area, and size' mathematics unit, using practical applications
   activities connected to the students' everyday lives. The study involved
   treatment (n = 36) and comparison (n = 41) groups of grade 5 students
   (females) enrolled in a private school in Dhahran City. The comparison
   group was instructed using a conventional approach involving separate
   science and mathematics units, while the treatment group was instructed
   using the integrated unit. Two achievement tests for the target science
   and mathematics units were developed and used in the pretest-posttest
   design to verify the equivalence of the treatment and comparison groups
   before conducting the study, and to compare the achievement results
   after implementing the conventional and treatment units. The study found
   statistically significant differences favouring the treatment group on
   the achievement posttest (effect sizes were 0.44 for science and 0.49
   for mathematics). These large effect sizes indicated the positive impact
   of using the proposed strategy of curriculum integration to evaluate the
   teaching program to see if the goal of improved achievement was actually
   realised.},

Abstract = {In Taiwan, the social community, Facebook has been more and more
   powerful ever since being launched, and it serves as if a strong magnet,
   attracting teachers and students to share and discuss on such platform,
   and also to search for films, pictures, and messages of their specific
   interests. Some researchers have probed into the learning interaction
   and efficacy of a computer programming course, and the results show that
   not only could the learning interactions between teachers and students
   enhance, but also between students themselves under this environment
   supported by Facebook. We propose four steps of learning analytics to
   study students' behaviors and learning performances in a social
   community supporting computer programming course. Furthermore, our
   learning analytics method could decrease the time and energy consuming
   process, which includes collecting, correlating and organizing students'
   participative patterns. A reported case, focuses on students' engagement
   behaviors and its influence on students' learning outcomes, is carried
   out with 43 freshmen at a university in northern Taiwan. The results
   show that our learning analytics method benefits students' participative
   behaviors, which are related to students' learning achievements in the
   computer programming course supported by social community, since
   students could obtain better understanding under such learning mode.},

Abstract = {High-level sports teams in universities are crucial for cultivating
   high-level athletes in China. Currently, coaches are the most direct
   managers of university (including colleges) sports teams in China, with
   their management styles and approaches having a direct impact on
   athletes' psychology. This study focused on high-level university
   football teams and explored the impact of transformational leadership on
   athlete turnover intention. The mediating effect of the ``coach-athlete
   relationship,{''}which helps establish and develop high-level university
   sports teams in China, was also examined. Overall, coaches with a
   transformational leadership style were found to have a significant
   effect on reducing athlete turnover intention and enhancing the
   coach-athlete relationship. In fact, the effect of coaches'
   transformational leadership behavior on athlete turnover intention is
   mediated through the coach-athlete relationship.},

Abstract = {Many research papers have studied the problem of taking a set of data
   and separating it into subgroups through the methods of Cluster
   Analysis. However, the variables and parameters involved in Cluster
   Analysis have not always been outlined and criticized, especially in the
   field of Science Education. Moreover, in the field of Science Education,
   a comparison between two different Clustering methods is not discussed
   in the literature. In this paper two different Cluster Analysis methods
   are described and the variables and parameters involved are discussed in
   order to clarify the information that they can supply. The clustering
   results obtained by using the two methods are compared and showed a good
   coherence between them. The results are interpreted and compared with
   the literature. More detail about the relationship between different
   student conceptions of modeling in physics was obtained.},

Abstract = {Under the background of education modernization, construction of
   bilingual teaching courses in colleges and universities is directly
   driven by project of undergraduate teaching quality and teaching reform
   launched by the Ministry of Education, and has been expanding rapidly.
   This paper, takes the course of ``introduction to e-commerce{''} as an
   object, measures the bilingual teaching effect from the four aspects,
   namely teachers' professional capacity, teachers' foreign language
   capacity, students' learning motivation and suitability of teaching
   materials. The results of the study show that, students learning
   motivation, teachers' professional capacity and teachers' foreign
   language capacity significantly impact the bilingual teaching effect of
   ``introduction to e-commerce{''}. Therefore, colleges and universities
   should actively guide students to interest in learning, stimulate
   students' learning motivation, improve teachers' foreign language level
   and enhance their professional quality, so as to improve the bilingual
   teaching effect of the course.},

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of audit opinions on the cost of debt
   based on accounting education and knowledge management theory. The
   empirical results of whole sample regression show that audit opinions
   are negatively correlated with the cost of debt and financial
   marketization weakens the effect of audit opinions on debt pricing. The
   subsample regression results of audit opinions indicate that financial
   marketization is negatively correlated with the cost of debt only in
   companies with modified audit opinions. This implies that audit opinions
   play a more important role in debt pricing compared to the financial
   marketization of companies' localities.},

   establish the evaluation index system of university students' employment
   in this paper. Then we use the practical method of interpretative
   structural model to analyze the influence factors of university
   students' employment, and explain the factors that affect college
   students' employment model. According to the hierarchical results of
   interpretative structural model, we analyze the connection between the
   various factors, and divide the influence factors of university
   students' employment into four levels. Finally, we clear the
   hierarchical structure relationship of factors that affect college
   students' employment, and find out the most direct factors and the most
   fundamental factors which cause the low employment rate of college
   students.},

Abstract = {Applied courses are difficult to teach to undergraduate engineering
   students in classical classrooms. To facilitate students' understanding
   and capture their motivation, technology should be incorporated into
   classrooms. In the Engineering Faculty, there are courses that are
   difficult to learn in a classical classroom and laboratory sessions; the
   programming algorithm course is one such class. Educational robots are
   required for teaching and learning programming algorithm logic. The Lego
   Mindstorms EV3 robots represent excellent technology to teach
   programming algorithm course subjects. The important point about the
   programming algorithms course is that it enables understanding of the
   logic of programming, as it enhances students' understanding of what it
   means when they are coding. This paper investigates how engineering
   faculty students' achievements are affected by robotics technology when
   learning computer programming algorithm logics. It analyses a usable
   solution with the Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot in the engineering
   classrooms for the introduction to computer programming course. The
   statistical results showed, Lego robot usage has raised student
   achievement in the introduction to computer programming course.},

Abstract = {Everyone would encounter the life issue of solving complicated problems
   generated by economic behaviors among all activities for making a
   living. Various life problems encountered therefore could be generalized
   by economic statistics. In other words, a lot of important events in
   daily life are related to economic statistics. For this reason, teaching
   students to understand the world, make reasonable decisions, and behave
   correctly on important personal or social issue has been the major
   objectives and directions of education. Taking universities in Fujian
   Province as the research subjects, including Xiamen University and
   Fuzhou University, the experimental design is applied to this study. The
   research results reveal that 1.creative problem solving teaching would
   affect attitudes toward learning, 2.creative problem solving teaching
   would influence learning achievements, 3.attitudes toward learning show
   significantly positive effects on learning effect in learning
   achievements, and 4.attitudes toward learning present notably positive
   effects on learning gain in learning achievements. According to the
   results, suggestions are eventually proposed in this study, expecting to
   train students' ability to make correct judgment and solve problems when
   facing the diverse and complicated information in the society or the
   critical choice of continuing study or looking for employment as well as
   to enhance the urgency.},

Abstract = {The relevance of this work was connected with the problem of ethical
   competencies forming among future psychologists during their learning in
   university. The first task of research was to work out the technology of
   ethical development for studentspsychologists. The structure of this
   technology included four main educational components: information
   support, research work, case-study and demonstration reports. Second
   task was to approve the technology of development of ethical
   competencies for university students. It was solved through using active
   learning methods in the context of constructivism approach. The methods
   of research were: theoretical analysis, ``forming{''} experiment,
   content analysis, specially organized discussions, modeling, audio and
   visual methods, used for actualizing of main ethical problems in
   psychology practice and supporting of discuss processes among students.
   The main result of work was the new effective technology for learning of
   professional ethics among students-future psychologists. The technology
   includes theoretical and practical modules, combined use of which
   provides effective mastering of ethical competencies by students.
   Practical significance of the technology lies in the integration of
   theoretical constructs with active teaching methods and is determined by
   possibility of its use by teachers and graduate students of higher
   educational institutions within the framework of the discipline
   ``Professional Ethics{''} for psychologists. The originality of
   technology is based on creation of special conditions, where students
   are given the opportunity to construct knowledge themselves, what
   increases their interest in discipline and activates the creativity.},

Abstract = {Environmental education is essential for people to pursue sustainable
   development. In Taiwan, environmental education is taught to students
   until they graduate from junior high school. This study was conducted to
   establish an assessment system for junior high schools to select
   appropriate environmental education facilities and sites. A mix of
   quantitative and qualitative methods, involving a literature review and
   expert in-depth interviews, was employed to establish an assessment
   hierarchy and indicators. Next, the fuzzy hierarchy process was adopted
   to formulate various assessment criteria and indicator weights, which
   were then verified. The results of this study can serve as a reference
   for junior high schools in selecting environmental education facilities
   and sites, thus achieving the expected outcomes of environmental
   education.},

Abstract = {Through the learning of physics, students will acquire problem solving
   skills which are relevant to their daily life. Determining the best way
   in which students learn physics takes a priority in physics education.
   The goal of the present study was to determine the effect of problem
   based learning strategy on students' problem solving skills and its role
   in building their motivation. A quasi-experimental research method was
   adapted. Problem solving inventory test and motivation scale were used
   to collect data. Subjects included were 81 grade 12 students taken from
   Wachemo Preparatory school. There was a mean difference between
   comparison and experimental groups. The covariate analysis shows that
   the difference was statistically significant with effect size above
   average. However, there was insignificant difference in motivation to
   learn physics. The study suggested that to improve students'
   achievement, schools must adapt the PBL method carefully. However,
   students' motivation to learn physics remains vague.},

Abstract = {MathForward is a program that provides teacher professional development
   and integrates the use of technology as a tool in the classroom. The
   present study examined students' mathematics growth from 2012 to 2013
   and observed how students' mathematics scores changed after their school
   implemented the MathForward program. The sample consisted of two years
   of the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) test
   data for a total of 563 students. The participants took the first STAAR
   examination in 2012 at the end of 7th grade and took the second
   examination in 2013 at the end of 8th grade. In general, regardless of
   background or student characteristic, pupils increased their mathematics
   STAAR test scores statistically significantly (p < .05) with the Cohen's
   d effect size of 0.26. Properly implemented, MathForward could be useful
   in raising the mathematics achievement of students.},

Abstract = {Even though aesthetic labour has gradually revealed social and economic
   value in the employment market, little research has been carried out on
   the connection and practice of aesthetic labour in technical and
   vocational education. Front-line ground staffs account for the largest
   proportion of the employees of airlines and can provide colleges with
   more off-school internships or well-matched employment vacancies. The
   aesthetic labour displayed by ground staff combines functional value
   with emotional value, contributing to a unique customer experience.
   According to the frequency distribution of retrieved questionnaires, the
   interviewed passengers tended to have positive verbal comments for the
   generalization of their evaluations of employees' aesthetic attributes.
   The `aggregation function by verbal evaluating' was used to evaluate the
   weight values of the aesthetic dimensions as well as their corresponding
   items. The results showed that the passengers paid the most attention to
   the ` service contact norms' that integrated all their needs concerning
   individual interest, followed by the ` behaviour norms' of interpersonal
   interactions and then the explicit ` dressing norms' and ` appearance
   norms' of service suppliers. This study offers reference for the
   curriculum and internship planning of relevant departments of colleges,
   and provides enterprises with a direction for strategic recruitment,
   development, and reward programs.},

Abstract = {This research study aimed to analyze the relationship between content
   knowledge and argumentation by examining students' prior subject matter
   knowledge and their production of arguments as well as by comparing
   students' arguments with their knowledge-in-use during scientific
   argumentation sessions. A correlational research design was carried out
   for this research by using qualitative and quantitative methods. The
   participants of the study were 13 senior pre-service physics teachers
   studying in a large urban state university. Six scientific argumentation
   sessions in different contexts under different contents were implemented
   in the methods course where pre-service teachers meet for 5 h per week.
   Written and oral data were collected by using a variety of methods for
   different purposes. Toulmin's Argument Pattern was used to evaluate the
   arguments while content knowledge was analyzed by the model developed by
   Chi and Roscoe (2002). Some of the conclusions drawn from the study are
   as follows: First, a positive relationship exists between individuals'
   content knowledge they use and quantity of arguments they produce during
   a scientific argumentation. Second, some conditions influence the
   relationship. Third, there are number of interactional factors affecting
   production of arguments. Fourth, learners' characteristics has an impact
   on their engagement with argumentation. Suggestions and implications
   have been made.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to develop a STEAM program in the
   context of teaching and learning a traditional Korean instrument and
   implement it in a high school class to determine the program's
   effectiveness. The STEAM program was developed through a continuous
   consultation process between a development team and external experts,
   including an ``artisan of Korean music.{''} This program was implemented
   for six weeks in an 11th grade science class, which consisted of
   twenty-six students. The twenty-six students who participated in this
   research study engaged in semi-structured interviews to determine how
   the students became aware of the STEAM program and verify the
   applicability of the program. The results are as follows: students
   recognized the meaning and necessity of STEAM education as a
   problem-solving procedure that resulted in increased STEAM literacy and
   a development of concepts through sharing opinions. Most students
   indicated that they would frequently make use of the knowledge they
   learned in the STEAM program in their science class because it allowed
   them to have a better understanding of the problem-solving process.
   Therefore, STEAM programs in science class are apt to contribute to
   STEAM literacy through the integration of science, technology and art as
   well as develop creative problem-solving abilities by introducing new
   ideas.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on one part of a larger study which aimed at testing
   the effectiveness of an interactive optics teaching module in enhancing
   Grade 11 learners' conceptual understanding of reflection. The focus of
   this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of a part of the interactive
   optics teaching module in enhancing learners' conceptual understanding
   about the characteristics of the image formed in a plane mirror. The
   sample consisted of 70 learners, selected from one school in the Eastern
   Cape Province in South Africa. Within the quasi-experimental design, the
   data were collected from four relevant questions of the questionnaire
   (designed for the larger study). Findings indicated that the designed
   teaching module was effective in enhancing learners' understanding of
   image formation by a plane mirror.},

Abstract = {Ill-structured problems can be regarded as one of the measures that meet
   recent social needs emphasizing students' abilities to solve real-life
   problems. This study aimed to analyze the mathematical abstraction
   process in solving such problems, and to identify the mathematical
   abstraction level ({[}I] Recognition of mathematical structure through
   perceptual abstraction, {[}II] Application of mathematical structure
   recognition through internalization, and {[}III] Formation of new
   mathematical structure recognition through interiorization) and form of
   the students, by applying ill-structured problem-solving activities to
   problem-solving learning approaches for fifth grade elementary school
   students. The study results showed that 2 out of 6 groups displayed the
   highest level {[}III] of mathematical abstraction, while two other
   groups displayed Level {[}I], and the other two groups showed Level
   {[}II]. Especially, the students in each group showed higher levels and
   forms of mathematical abstraction (from Level {[}I] to {[}II] and
   {[}III]) over the course of the problem solving process. These study
   results showed that the mathematical abstraction levels and forms of the
   students can be improved by exposure to mathematical abstraction through
   a problem solving learning approach using ill-structured problems.},

Abstract = {We examined the influence of several students' cognitive and
   motivational factors on 8th graders' science achievement and also gender
   differences on factors that significantly contribute to the science
   achievement model. A total of 99 girls and 83 boys responded all the
   instruments used in this study. Results showed that girls outperformed
   boys on science achievement. Furthermore, regression analyses showed a
   model including initial conceptual knowledge, scientific reasoning, and
   utility value of science as independent variables best predicted science
   achievement. Results also showed girls and boys did not differ on
   initial conceptual knowledge and scientific reasoning but on utility
   value of science. Implications for science education were discussed
   according to the findings.},

Abstract = {This research is trying to evaluate the feedback of Thai secondary
   school students to inquiry-based teaching and learning methods,
   exemplified by the study of chemical kinetics. This work used the
   multiple-choice questions, scientifically practical diagram and
   questionnaire to assess students' understanding of chemical kinetics.
   The findings suggest that there was a difference in students'
   understanding of chemical kinetics as measured via diagnostic tests.
   While students made significant progress in drawing concept lists,
   phrasing scientific questions, identifying variables, designing
   experiments, presenting data and analyzing results, they showed only
   some improvement about drawing conclusions in practical classes. This
   more active, student-centred learning seemed to help students enjoy
   activities and become interested in learning chemical kinetics.},

Abstract = {Pre-service science teachers' conceptual understanding of astronomical
   concepts and their misconceptions in these concepts is crucial to study
   since they will teach these subjects in middle schools after becoming
   teachers. This study aimed to explore both seventh-grade students' and
   the science teachers' understanding of astronomical concepts and to
   diagnose the misconceptions of seventh-grade students and pre-service
   science teachers regarding some basic astronomy concepts derived from a
   three-tier test. The test was administered to 105 pre-service science
   teachers and 91 seventh-grade students. The best conceptual
   understanding was related to the properties of the Sun. The students and
   pre-service science teachers have some common misconceptions in
   astronomy. Pre-service teachers mostly have misconceptions not regarding
   complex concepts but instead in very basic knowledge of astronomy. There
   is a need to take serious measures to correct the misconceptions of the
   teachers, since under such circumstances it is optimistic to expect them
   to teach the subject correctly.},

Abstract = {There are numerous types and variations of social networking web sites,
   such as MySpace, FB, Hi5, and Cyworld. Of these networks, the most
   commonly used is FB. Because of the widespread use of FB by youth, its
   effects on student achievement has recently become one of the most
   important issues that are curious for families. Therefore, it has become
   necessary to study the use of social networking sites for educational
   purposes and their related variables. In the present study, the
   variables that affect the educational use of FB and the relationships
   among these variables are examined and presented through a model. In the
   current study, data are collected from undergraduate students in the
   College of Education at an Anatolian university in Turkey. The
   participants consist of 1,066 undergraduates-65\% are female (n = 691)
   and 35\% male (n = 375). The result shows that knowledge of these
   variables enables us to largely understand the educational use of FB by
   individuals. In conclusion, it was seen that students who use FB for
   educational purposes more have higher GPAs. These students use FB more
   frequently but they spend less time on it. Also, they have fewer FB
   friends than students who have low GPAs.},

Abstract = {Understanding ecosystems is challenging, but important for becoming
   environmentally-literate citizens of today's society. People have
   difficulty considering how different components, mechanisms, and
   phenomena, both visible and invisible, are interconnected within
   ecosystems. This research presents both the design and initial testing
   of an innovative and technology-intensive classroom intervention. This
   intervention was designed to support middle school students.
   understanding of an aquatic ecosystem through encouraging explicit
   Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) conceptual representation of
   ecosystems. The technology support included hypermedia organized around
   SBF, NetLogo simulations, and an SBF modeling tool. Our study analyzed
   pre-and post-test data coded for SBF relationships generally, and
   relationships between Macro-and Micro-level (M-M) structures, behaviors,
   and functions, using 311 students in the classrooms of four science
   teachers. We found moderate to large effects of our intervention with
   students. understanding of SBF relationships and recognition of M-M
   level relationships increasing over time. The increased consideration of
   relationships derived from the SBF intervention is important for a more
   sophisticated understanding of ecosystems in middle school science
   classrooms. Additionally, by using the SBF framework, micro-level
   systems phenomena might be made more salient for young learners.},

Abstract = {Solution set of any inequality or compound inequality, which has
   one-variable, lies in the real line which is one dimensional. So a
   difficulty appears when computer assisted graphical representation is
   intended to use for teaching these topics. Sketching a one-dimensional
   graph by using computer software is not a straightforward work. In this
   paper, an innovative approach is suggested by using GeoGebra, the free
   dynamic mathematics software. This approach was theoretically based on
   Sackur's suggestion, which is created by semiotic register theorem of
   Duval. The dynamic application, described in this paper, also provides
   an opportunity to observe more complex, even impossible to solve
   analytically, inequalities' solution sets visually. At the end of the
   paper, it is also explained that how this approach also has the
   potential of allowing the students to make detailed reasoning towards
   finding solutions of inequalities and compound inequalities.},

Title = {Can a Syllabus Change Impact on Students' Perceptions of Science?
   Fragmented and Cohesive Conceptions of Physics},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the literature paid attention to students'
   conceptions of the nature of disciplines. This study aimed to
   investigate how students' cohesive and fragment conceptions of physics
   changed with a major change in senior high school physics syllabus. We
   obtained measures of conceptions of physics by utilizing a 20-item
   questionnaire and triangulated by open-ended responses. The sample was
   1979 first year university students from three different years surveyed
   in their first laboratory session. The first cohort of 780 first year
   university students had experienced the old syllabus in high school and
   the next two cohorts of 511 and 688 first year university students had
   experienced a rejuvenated high school syllabus. By establishing the
   reliability and validity we found that there exists a substantial shift
   in student conceptions of the cohesiveness of physics coinciding with
   the school syllabus change. This shift was mirrored in qualitative data.
   Furthermore, students with more previous engagement in physics learning,
   on the average, demonstrated less fragmented and more cohesive
   conceptions with the rejuvenated syllabus than with the old syllabus.},

Abstract = {Certain animals have represented a danger to humans in terms of a
   predation and pathogen threat over our evolutionary history. It is
   therefore adaptive for people to respond to a potential threat faster
   than to harmless events. Using simple choice tasks, the reaction time of
   children to predators, disease carriers and aposematically coloured
   animals were investigated. Children reacted the fastest to predators,
   followed by disease carriers and finally aposematically coloured
   animals. Furthermore, children manifested the highest accuracy when
   distinguishing predators from non-predators, followed by disease
   carriers and harmless animals, with the most errors occurring when
   identifying the aposematically coloured from non-aposematically coloured
   animals. Importantly, children more vulnerable to infectious diseases
   responded to disease carriers faster than healthier children. These
   results suggest that children are skilled in distinguishing potential
   danger from non-danger and that the behavioural immune system influences
   reaction times in visual contact with the pathogen threat.},

   an important measure to improve the quality of talent cultivation in
   China. The so-called collaborative development of
   production-study-research, namely, enterprises, schools and scientific
   research institutions in the industry coordinate with each other, and
   give full play to advantages respectively, forming Integrated advanced
   systems for research, development and production, and also reflecting
   comprehensive advantage in the process of the whole system operation.
   Enterprises are the demand side of the talent and technology,
   universities and research institutes, through technological development
   and training students in teaching, provide enterprises with talents and
   technology to meet various needs in the process of enterprise production
   and ensure that the high-quality talents can get better development and
   adapt to the social environment. In this paper, the method of
   documentary and field interview are used, firstly, the current research
   status of the collaborative path of production -study-research in
   university is analyzed, reflecting the main perspective of the
   collaborative path construction of collaborative path of production
   -study-research in university. Secondly, the research results shows the
   involving condition for building collaborative path of
   production-study-research in university, indicating the significance of
   constructing material basis, strengthen the credibility foundation of
   the cooperative subject, coordinate the property rights of each subject
   as well as establish integration mechanism of production-teach-research,
   and it provides theoretical support for the further research work.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the incidence of senile dementia is rising rapidly that
   have seriously affected lives of senility. This article generally
   describes senile dementia classification, pathology and symptoms,
   analyzes the influence which exercise has on central nerve system of
   senility, and approaches how to formulate exercise-prescription for such
   people. Research shows that moderate exercise for a long time can reduce
   the loss in the anterior horn of spinal cord neurons in the aging
   process; it means that exercise has a protective effect on neurons. In
   addition, exercise can improve spatial learning behavior, but clearly
   shows that exercise plays a positive role in prevention of brain aging.
   Various forms of exercise can help pyramidal cells dendritic spines
   within the cerebral cortex on the rise, therefore, physical exercise can
   improve the function of cerebral cortex, strengthen people's
   intelligence. In addition, exercise to a certain extent can reduce
   anxiety; old people who take frequent exercise have a better cognition,
   better sensory memory, short-term memory and long-term memory than those
   who do not. In general, old people who take frequent exercise have short
   reaction time in need to do concentrate work, which is of great
   significance to delay the onset of senile dementia.},

Abstract = {Due to the complexity of the e-commerce system, a hybrid model for
   online-purchasing behavior forecasting is developed to predict whether
   or not a customer makes a purchase during the next visit to the online
   store based on the previous behaviors, i.e., online-purchasing behavior.
   The proposed model makes contributions to literature from two
   perspectives: (1) a classification model is proposed based on the
   ``hybrid modeling{''} concept, in which an effective artificial
   intelligence (AI) technique of support vector machine (SVM) is employed
   for classification forecasting and further extended by introducing the
   promising AI optimization tool of firefly algorithm (FA), to solve the
   crucial but tough task of parameters selection, i.e., the FA-based SVM
   model; (2) an appropriate predictor set is carefully designed especially
   considering online shopping cart use which was otherwise neglected in
   existing models, apart from other common online behaviors, e.g.,
   clickstream behavior, previous purchase behavior and customer
   heterogeneity. To verify the superiority of the proposed model, an
   online furniture store is focused on as study sample, and the empirical
   results statistically support that the proposed FA-based SVM model
   considering online shopping cart use significantly beat all benchmarking
   models (with other popular classification methods and/or different
   predictor sets) in terms of prediction accuracy.},

Abstract = {The development of innovative education in universities is influenced by
   many factors inside and outside the system. It is important to identify
   the key factors of innovative education in universities, and it is
   helpful to promote the practice of innovative education and the
   development of entrepreneurship education. This paper takes Jiangsu
   Province as an example to study innovative education in universities.
   Based on research ideas of data envelopment analysis, fifteen factors
   from two angles of input and output are designed. According to the
   relevant statistics of Jiangsu Province from 2006 to 2015, the grey
   relational model is used to analyze the factors that affect the
   development level of the innovative education in universities, and the
   key factors are identified and evaluated. Based on quantitative results,
   countermeasures are put forward from the aspects of educational concept,
   management system, teaching practice and so on.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the request and apology
   strategies of Kurdish EFL undergraduate students (KEFLUS) and their
   linguistic and pragmatic competence in making requests and apologies.
   The participants were 83 KEFLUS and 14 native speakers of English (NSE).
   A Discourse Completion Task (DCT) and rating scale developed by the
   researcher were used to collect the data. After the responses were
   collected, the data were coded and analysed according to the taxonomy of
   Blum-Kulka et al. (1989) Cross-Cultural Speech Acts Realization Patterns
   (CCSARP) for request and the Olshtain and Cohen (1983) taxonomy for
   apology. Furthermore, the collected data were rated by four researchers.
   The results of the study revealed the differences in responses between
   the KEFLUS and NSE groups and between the state and private
   universities. However, no significant difference was found between
   KEFLUS males and females. Moreover, the KEFLUS responses were in general
   pragmatically and structurally appropriate.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of improving the quality of education
   for children attending schools located in rural areas, including
   under-filled rural schools and branches of rural schools in Russia. The
   relevance of this study is determined by the lack of scientifically
   substantiated, practically approved models of interaction of these
   branches with the basic school, the absence of a sufficient regulatory
   framework for their operation, and the scientific and methodological
   support of the educational process therein. It was found that there is a
   strong correlation dependence between the share of rural schools and the
   share of rural population in the region, and there is a weak correlation
   dependence between the number of rural school branches and the share of
   the rural population, the population density, and the number of rural
   schools. On the basis of the results obtained, provisions on the
   subjectivity of branch establishment process in rural schools are
   formulated.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the factors forming Modern Art by examining the
   Barbizon school's approach in art education, in comparison to the
   academic understanding of art. The invention of photography steered the
   visual art schools towards a new conceptualization of nature. The
   awareness that Impressionist and Post-impressionist movements achieved
   in the depiction of nature came to define modern art. Modern art finds
   character with the learning outcomes of new art education and approaches
   that brake away from the traditional Renaissance depiction of nature.
   Cubist movement which forms a foundation for Modern art transformed the
   images of nature through a conceptual perception that experiences visual
   reality as a mental stage. The impact of Cubist geometric and
   multi-perspective portrayal of nature will be examined in Modern Art
   painting samples. The artistic performance of Jackson Pollock will be
   associated with the development of Modern Art to provide a fresh

Abstract = {Objective: With the development of economy, our living level is being
   improved, and we pay more and more attention to physical health, whereas
   a well-built and shapely body and good temperament is also an inevitable
   requirement of social development. With regard to this, implementing
   aerobics teaching in universities could adapt to the demands of social
   development. Research methods: In this paper, literature review,
   experimental comparison, mathematical statistics were applied to mainly
   explore the effects of aerobics on female university students' physical
   health. Research results show that aerobics teaching were mainly divided
   into physical training and dance training, which were characterized by
   elegant, artistic, comprehensive, targeted, rich movement contents and
   simple movement. Aerobics teaching could correct undesirable female
   university students' body shape, contribute to their well shape
   building, reduce excessive body fat and improve body functions
   effectively, enhance their heart and lung functions and cardiovascular
   system and then further promote their physical health level.},

Abstract = {In order to verify whether environmental education can play guiding role
   among the individuals in terms of the reuse of recycled water, and to
   further confirm its mechanism of action, a structural equation model was
   established in this study regarding to the influence of knowledge about
   recycled water on acceptability of recycled water. Besides, a survey was
   made among 714 individuals. The structural equation model revealed that
   high levels of knowledge about recycled water stimulate individuals'
   trust in water authorities, and reduce their perceived risk of recycled
   water. More specially, knowledge about recycled water was reported to be
   a significant predictor of individuals' acceptability of recycled water.
   Individuals' high levels knowledge about recycled water can affect their
   acceptability of recycled water indirectly through two different ways,
   while high levels knowledge about recycled water can reduce the
   individuals' perceived risk of recycled water, so it could increase
   their acceptability of recycled water indirectly. Another influence path
   is that high levels knowledge about recycled water could reduce
   individuals' perceived risk of recycled water by improving their trust
   in the water authorities, and ultimately improve their acceptability of
   recycled water. In this paper, it has proved that environmental
   education has significance guiding effect on individuals in terms of the
   use of recycled water, and provided a clue as how does environmental
   education affects individuals' behavior to use recycled water.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify factors shaping career
   expectations of Qatari students. The study examined individual and
   motivational variables likely to influence career expectations in STEM
   fields, the public sector, and business. This study used survey data of
   802 Qatari students and 543 parents from the 2012 Qatar Education Study.
   The results suggest a varied, context-dependent portrait of career
   expectations. The results indicate that the education system in Qatar
   influenced students' STEM career expectations and demonstrate that
   operating a private business or seeking a job in the public sector
   continues to rival their expectations about STEM careers in Qatar. The
   paper concludes with some important implications for policy as well as
   recommendations for further study and research.},

Abstract = {Given the fact that early mathematics education is important for further
   learning of mathematics, authors of this paper examine the effects that
   preschool mathematics education on development of geometry concepts in
   children. On a sample of 290 children, through a one-on-one interview,
   we studied the development of geometry concepts in children at the end
   of preschool education in Serbia. Research results show that the
   preschool mathematics education achieves significant effects developing
   geometry concepts in children. Preschool mathematics education does not
   achieve equal effects on the development of all geometry concepts
   covered by the curriculum of preschool education, that there are no
   differences in the development of these concepts depending on the
   location of the preparatory preschool institution and the gender of the
   child, but that the education level of the child's parents has great
   impact on the development of these concepts.},

Abstract = {It is necessary to cultivate innovative and entrepreneurial talents in
   colleges and universities to meet the needs of constructing
   innovation-oriented country, which is also an important breakthrough in
   the realization of higher education reform in Chinese universities.
   According to the problems in the process of current entrepreneurial
   talent cultivation in Chinese local application-oriented universities,
   based on TPB behavioral theory and the sample data of 378 college
   students in 3 universities, combined with insufficient entrepreneurial
   spirit, weak entrepreneurial awareness, weak innovation skills and other
   major puzzles that met in the process of entrepreneurship by students,
   the paths of attitude towards entrepreneurial action, entrepreneur's
   subjective norm and perceivable behavioral control to influence
   students' entrepreneurial intention were simulated. According to the
   results of analysis, it proved that the training of students'
   entrepreneurial conciousness should be strengthened, practical teaching
   in the process of entrepreneurship education should be highlighted, and
   the policy support for students' entrepreneurial activities should be
   strengthened in order to improve, and realize the improvement of the
   training quality of innovation and entrepreneurship talents in Chinese
   local application-oriented universities with the organic combination of
   innovation education and science and technology education.},

Abstract = {Extracurricular sports play positive roles on strengthening students'
   conditions, promoting students' mental health and developing good
   habits, which give the students a great pull. We adopted scientific and
   researchable methods of questionnaires and expert interviews. Based on
   sports science, pedagogy and psychology, we started with the demands of
   college senior girls to extracurricular sports organized by colleges and
   the related influencing factors. We believed the habits formed from
   childhood and the influences from the families are the primary factors
   of promoting the students to participate in extracurricular sports.
   Besides, a good sports atmosphere and a clear monitoring mechanism are
   an important factor of promoting the students to participate actively in
   extracurricular sports. In this paper, we proposed some reference
   measures including strengthen school management and develop a healthy
   living, strengthen theoretical guidance and build a concept of lifelong
   sports, rich the form of organization and correctly guide the students
   to participate in activities.},

Abstract = {Basic education plays the fundamental and leading role in the national
   education system. Strengthening and optimizing the allocation of
   resources in basic education and improving the performance of fiscal
   expenditure on basic education has always been the focus of academic
   attention. In this paper, the teacher-student ratio, per-student
   educational appropriations, per-student fixed assets are taken as the
   input indexes, graduation rate as the output index, data envelopment
   analysis (DEA) is used to analyze the performance of basic education
   expenditure from 2005 to 2014, obtaining the comprehensive technical
   efficiency, pure technical efficiency, scale efficiency, scale income
   and scale elasticity of the basic education expenditure. It is believed
   that in the input structure of basic education, raising the amount of
   input in junior middle school can improve the expenditure performance of
   the whole basic education better than the other three stages. At the
   same time, in the way of basic education input, improving the quality of
   resource allocation of input factors can improve the performance of
   basic education expenditure better than simply increasing the scale of
   input factors. Therefore, the performance of fiscal expenditure can be
   improved by optimizing the input structure of the financial expenditure
   and the matching quality of resources in the basic education stage.},

Abstract = {Under the back ground of ``The public business, Peoples innovation{''},
   people, especially college students need improve their entrepreneurial
   capability. Therefore, this paper aims to reveal the way how
   entrepreneurial education influences entrepreneurial capability. The
   cultivation and promotion of college students' entrepreneurial
   capability is one of the important tasks of colleges and universities at
   present. To improve the importance of entrepreneurial capability, we
   should firstly have a comprehensive cognition and positioning about
   entrepreneurial capability for college students. According to the mutual
   restriction factors we try to establish the path of cultivation and
   promotion the entrepreneurial capability through entrepreneurial
   education and the joint efforts of families, society and the
   governments. Finally, we hope to help college students to improve their
   competitive entrepreneurial capability. Through questionnaire survey, we
   firstly recognize the key entrepreneurial capabilities for college
   students and then we build a research model to reveal the path of
   production and upgrading of entrepreneurial capability. Thus, we got
   results as follows: we could improve college students' entrepreneurial
   capability through strengthen entrepreneurship education in accordance
   with the auxiliary support of family, society and government. The
   research conclusion can not only enrich relative research of college
   students' entrepreneurship education, but also provide more practical
   and guiding sense for how to improve college students' entrepreneurial
   capability.},

Abstract = {The investment of education capital and fixed assets play an important
   role in the economic growth of one country, while traditional regression
   analysis may underestimate or overestimate the contribution of the
   investment of education capital and fixed assets on economic growth. In
   this paper, simple regression, bivariate regression and quantile
   regression methods are adopted to analyze the relation between the stock
   of fixed assets and education capital and gross domestic product (GDP).
   It is shown by research result that: the stock of fixed assets and
   education capital obviously impacts GDP, and the impact effect of the
   stock of education capital is larger than that of stock of fixed assets.
   It can be found through quantile regression that if linear regression is
   adopted to estimate the impact of the stock of education capital and
   fixed assets on GDP, the research may be anamorphic.},

Abstract = {Many gamification designs in education do effectively mobilize students
   to some extent. Yet, there is still very little research to account for
   the specific influence on each student. It is essential to determine
   whether the students can be engaged by gamification in terms of various
   psychological factors. In this paper, the game element point was chosen
   to design the experiment. The experiments were used to engage students
   to ask more questions in class. The results indicated that gamified
   designs were effective in engaging people who were bashful or
   distracted. In addition, students were engaged more easily in social
   circumstances through a comparison of individual and social
   interactions. This research provides fertile ground for further
   gamification designs in education.},

Abstract = {The development of China's technical education has been severely
   constrained by the shortage of education funds. China's technical
   education funding are too small. The main source of education comes from
   fiscal revenue. A large proportion of State-owned enterprises profit
   income as a major source of fiscal revenue are still retained in the
   enterprises. We should turn over a portion of State-owned enterprises
   profit for technical education funding in order to alleviate
   insufficient technical education funds. The central government should
   decentralize powers to ensure the activity of local government, thus
   achieving the optimal coordination of benefits between the two, so as to
   increase the local government technical education funding. We should
   further refine the responsibility of all levels of government, improve
   the management mechanism of technical education funds. And then we
   should implement a comprehensive, multi-level technical education
   funding management mechanism.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to probe into the impact of learners' gender on
   learning outcomes and motivation. A digital game focusing on the topic
   of emergency first aid is designed for the purpose of this present
   study, according to the curriculum objectives for a content-based
   instruction (CBI) course as part of the experiment. In the process of
   playing the game, learners are able to acquire both first aid knowledge
   and language skills at the same time. Results show that gender has no
   significant effect on the learning achievement, but causes significant
   differences in learning motivation. Learners of different genders are
   found to have better learning achievement through digital game-based
   learning. In a moderate genre digital game, female learners' motivation
   is significantly higher than that of male learners. The usability of the
   digital game in this study receives positive response from learners
   regardless of gender. This evaluation on usability is correlated with
   the findings of this study. Our analysis also demonstrates that game
   contents in the moderate genre reduce the effect of gender on learning
   achievement and motivation. Based on the above findings, this study
   suggests a relationship between gender and digital game-based learning
   and proposes avenues for further research.},

Abstract = {Integrating technology in the mathematics curriculum has become a
   necessary task for curriculum developers as well as mathematics
   practitioners across the world and time. In general research studies
   seeking a better understanding of how best to integrate mathematics
   analysis tools with mathematics subject matter normally observe
   mathematics lessons taught exclusively in a technology enriched
   environment or computer lab. In some universities where paper and pencil
   examination is the major assessment tool, undergraduate mathematics
   courses are still taught in a traditional manner that takes care of the
   algorithmic and procedural steps. This paper relates a study that
   embarks on the technology exposure claiming that human action is
   mediated by technological setting. Situated in a traditional classroom
   setting where there is more teaching and less hands-on, it reports
   foundation students' acceptance of technology-in-mathematics interaction
   in a typical course enriched with graphing calculator (GC) deliberated
   in the worksheets with printed GC commands alongside each question. Data
   was collected from students' worksheets and also questionnaire that
   measures attitudes towards technology in mathematics from a class of 763
   pre-university students. The results may enlighten mathematics
   practitioners about the feasibility of taking full advantage of
   technology to teach mathematics in a partially technology incorporated
   mathematics course.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to design a knowledge conversion and
   management digital learning system for architecture design learning,
   helping students to share, extract, use and create their design
   knowledge through web-based interactive activities based on
   socialization, internalization, combination and externalization process
   in addition to learning in the ``design studio{''} at school. In
   addition, the technology acceptance model3 is used in this study to
   measure how students accept the system developed in this study by
   analyzing the user behavioral and environmental factors that can affect
   their use of the system. The results of questionnaire surveys based on
   TAM3 indicate that this digital learning environment based on knowledge
   management can effectively reduce the challenge of ``ill-defined design
   problems{''} for students and help to promote better learning results.
   Therefore, it can be concluded that the knowledge transfer learning
   system developed in this study is very helpful for learning of
   architecture design.},

Abstract = {This research is conducted to obtain the thoughts of state high school
   administrators to determine the obstacles that they are exposed to while
   using technology and attempting to integrate technology into their
   schools. The research is carried out through using the qualitative
   research design `phenomenology'. The sample group of this research,
   which uses qualitative scanning methods, consists of 14 school
   administrators in North Cyprus during the academic year of 2015-2016.
   The sample group is identified using ``snowball sampling method{''}. The
   researcher has developed an interview form called `Interview Form for
   the Evaluation of Technology Use by School Administrators'. The acquired
   data has been put through `categorical analysis' which is one of the
   content analysis methods. The qualitative data analysis program NVIVO
   11.0 has been used for categorizing and coding the data. It was found
   that school administrators are not anxious concerning the use of
   technology at school but they fail to integrate the technology into the
   class.},

Abstract = {Research on the graphical facilitation of probabilistic reasoning has
   been characterised by the effort expended to identify valid assessment
   tools. The authors developed an assessment instrument to compare
   reasoning performances when problems were presented in verbal-numerical
   and graphical-pictorial formats. A sample of undergraduate psychology
   students (n=676) who had not developed statistical skills, solved
   problems requiring probabilistic reasoning. They attended universities
   in Spain (n=127; f=71.7\%) and Italy (n=549; f=72.9\%). In Italy 173
   undergraduates solved these problems under time pressure. The remaining
   students solved the problems without time limits. Classical Test Theory
   (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT) were applied to assess the effect
   of two formats and to evaluate criterion and discriminant validity. The
   instrument showed acceptable psychometric properties, providing
   preliminary evidence of validity.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to compare and contrast student, teacher,
   and school factors that are associated with student mathematics
   achievement in South Korea and the United States. Using the data from
   the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011,
   this study examines factors that are linked to teachers who deliver
   quality instruction with high self-efficacy in both countries. We also
   investigate the association between teachers with high-quality
   instruction and high self-efficacy and 8th graders' mathematics
   achievement. It was found that teachers' perceived academic emphasis was
   commonly associated with teachers who claimed to provide high-quality
   mathematics instruction with high self-efficacy. However, the two
   countries' results differed in the association between teachers'
   opportunities to learn in professional development programs and
   high-quality instruction with high self-efficacy. Implications from this
   study suggest that the quality and training of teachers and students'
   gender gap in achievement are significant issues.},

Abstract = {Mathematical thinking skills and meaningful mathematical understanding
   are among the goals of current mathematics education. There is a wide
   consensus among scholars about the purpose of developing mathematical
   understanding and higher order thinking skills in students. However, how
   to develop those skills in classroom settings is an area that still
   needs attention. Fostering mathematical communication in classroom
   settings is a strategy to develop students thinking skills by
   mathematical talk, discussion and activities. The purpose of the study
   is to explore teachers' perceptions and lived experiences about using
   mathematical communication in their classrooms. The study is qualitative
   and employed a phenomenological approach to gain in-depth insight about
   the nature of mathematical communication in the classroom setting.
   Participants were experienced elementary school mathematics teachers.
   They discussed about the concepts associated with, strategies to
   enhance, purposes and benefits and application of mathematical
   communication as well as impact of mathematical communication on
   thinking skills, during the interviews. The findings are expected to
   provide a basis for discussion about using mathematical communication to
   foster students' higher order thinking skills and mathematical
   understanding.},

Abstract = {In teaching geometry, most instructors opt for direct demonstration with
   detailed explanations; however, under this kind of instruction students
   face considerable difficulties in the development of the reasoning
   skills required to deal with problems of a geometric nature. This study
   adopted a nonequivalent pretest-postest quasi-experimental design
   employing Polya's approach of four-stage problem solving using question
   prompts in conjunction with multimedia demonstration. Two classes of
   grade 7 students were randomly selected as the experimental group
   receiving instruction based on Polya questioning and two others were
   selected as the control group receiving instruction based on direct
   presentation. Our results revealed that the posttest performance in
   geometry reasoning of students receiving instruction based on Polya
   questioning was superior to that of students receiving direct
   presentation. In addition, students receiving instruction based on Polya
   questioning expressed a stronger sense of participation in the course
   than did students receiving direct presentation.},

Abstract = {This study presents partial results from the project ``A Study of
   perceptual apprehensive, operative apprehensive, sequential
   apprehensive, and discursive apprehensive for elementary school students
   (POSD){''}, which was undertaken to explore gender differences and
   passing rate of van Hiele's geometric thinking level. The participants
   were 5,581 elementary school students randomly selected from 23
   counties/cities in Taiwan. The conclusions drawn from this study were:
   (a) evidence supporting the hierarchy of the van Hiele levels, (b)
   students at different levels have different concepts of basic figures,
   and (c) for elementary school students, the passing rates of boys and
   girls have no significant differences in van Hiele's geometric thinking
   level.},

Title = {Comparing Psychology Undergraduates' Performance in Probabilistic
   Reasoning under Verbal-Numerical and Graphical-Pictorial Problem
   Presentation Format: What is the Role of Individual and Contextual

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate about the existence of a graphical
   facilitation effect on probabilistic reasoning. Measures of
   undergraduates' performances on problems presented in both
   verbal-numerical and graphical-pictorial formats have been related to
   visuo-spatial and numerical prerequisites, to statistical anxiety, to
   attitudes towards statistics and to the confidence in response
   correctness. Psychology undergraduates in Italy and Spain with no
   statistical expertise (N= 676) completed a protocol under conditions of
   presence versus absence of time pressure. Hierarchical linear
   regressions and ANCOVAs with mixed design have been carried out
   separately for each sample. The best predictor of performance in both
   formats has been the confidence in solution correctness under the
   condition of time pressure administration, which seemed to promote the
   commitment to the task. The findings suggest that the eventual
   occurrence of a graphical facilitation could be the result of a
   multifactorial interaction among contextual and individual dimensions,
   rather than being strictly related to the problem presentation format.},

Abstract = {The Current study investigated the effect of the 5E learning cycle in
   which the simulations were integrated on pre-service science teachers'
   achievement in photoelectric subject. Four sophomore level classes with
   their 140 students participated in the research and a quasi-experimental
   design was used. The classes were randomly assigned into one of the two
   treatment groups. The experimental group (n1=69, male=16, female=53)
   studied photoelectric effect with the developed instruction and the
   control group (n2=71, male=19, female=52) studied the same subject with
   traditional instruction. Achievement test and open-ended exam were
   administered to measure students' pre-and-post achievements. The main
   effect of treatment on post-tests scores was examined via MANCOVA with
   pre-achievement scores used as covariate. The analyses yielded
   significant treatment effect on the collective dependent variables.
   Follow up ANCOVA results indicated that the instruction developed for
   the experimental group affected participants' post-achievement and
   post-open-ended exam scores significantly. Extensive analyses of the
   open-ended exam items showed that some of the participants were
   considering the supplied potential as the preliminary condition for the
   current flow in photocell circuit. The instructors or researchers would
   develop their treatments by integrating scientifically well-developed
   simulations into 5E learning cycle and use them in their lessons to
   promote learners' achievements.},

Abstract = {To examine the relative performance in number sense among low-SES
   students, new immigrant students, and typical learners in grades 4
   through 6, data were collected through a number sense web-based,
   two-tier test. A total of 628 fourth graders, 535 fifth graders, and 524
   sixth graders in Taiwan participated in this study. Results showed that
   there were statistically significant differences in number sense
   performance among new immigrant children, low-SES students, and typical
   learners in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. The subsequent post hoc
   comparisons indicated that there was a statistically significant
   difference between typical learners and new immigrant children in fourth
   and fifth grades. Moreover, there were statistically significant
   differences between typical learners and low-SES students in fifth and
   sixth grades. The Chi-squared test results also showed that there were
   significant differences in the uses of solution methods between the
   fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. Implications of this study and
   suggestions for the future studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {This essay proposes a reflection on the learning difficulties and
   teaching approaches associated with arithmetic word problem solving. We
   question the development of word problem solving skills in the early
   grades of elementary school. We are trying to revive the discussion
   because first, the knowledge in question-reversibility of arithmetic
   operations and flexibility of mathematical thinking-are the key elements
   in elementary mathematics, and second, because we hope to create a shift
   in the understanding of this knowledge development in students. Using
   the folk tale. The Three Little Pigs. as a metaphor, we analyze
   difficulties students experience while learning to solve word problems
   involving addition and subtraction. We formulate a hypothesis about
   cognitive duality of word problem-solving. This hypothesis explains some
   well-known learning difficulties and suggests teaching principles which
   would help to avoid developmental obstacles and pitfalls within the
   teaching/learning process.},

Abstract = {The problems of the decreasing enrolment of science students at
   secondary school level as well as the lagging science and mathematics
   achievement and literacy of Malaysian secondary students in
   international assessment studies point to a serious challenge for the
   government to improve Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
   (STEM) education. One of the key steps that can be taken is to identify
   the current assessments in STEM related subjects at the secondary school
   level because according to OECD (2005), assessment is an integral
   component of the education process. Thus, this study (which is part of a
   larger research project) aimed to examine secondary students'
   perceptions of assessments in STEM related subjects. The researchers
   employed a cross-sectional survey research design and the sample
   comprised of 1215 Form Four students from three categories of secondary
   schools in Peninsular Malaysia. A five-point Likert scale questionnaire
   containing 10 items was used to elicit Form Four students' perceptions
   of assessments such as examinations or assignments in STEM related
   subjects. The questionnaire was developed based on the STEM Education
   Quality Framework (2011). Analysis of 1005 complete questionnaires from
   the sample indicated that the students showed positive overall
   perceptions of assessments in STEM related subjects. The results also
   indicated that there was a statistically significant difference in
   overall perceptions of assessments in STEM related subjects in terms of
   school category but there was no statistically significant difference in
   overall perceptions of assessments in STEM related subjects in terms
   gender.},

Abstract = {Students' achievement in Biology is often looked up as a benchmark to
   evaluate the mode of teaching and learning in higher education.
   Problem-based learning (PBL) is an approach that focuses on students'
   solving a problem through collaborative groups. There were eighty
   samples involved in this study. The samples were divided into three
   groups: ICT integrated with PBL group: a PBL group, and a lecture group.
   The PBL with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) group used a
   PBL module integrated with the following ICT elements: Microsoft Word
   template; Microsoft PowerPoint; electronic discussion group, and blog.
   Meanwhile the PBL group used the PBL module alongside log books and
   posters. The control group utilized the lecture method. All these groups
   went through four sessions of Biology. Before the beginning of session
   one and after the fourth session, an achievement test was given to all
   the students. Based on the analysis for MANOVA with repeated measure
   3x2x2, the main effect for type of treatment, exam time and subscale was
   found significantly different. Additionally, the type of treatment
   interacts with exam time and subscale in contributing towards the
   achievement test scores. Overall, the findings suggested that the ICT
   integrated with PBL group was significant compared to the PBL group and
   control group. The ICT integrated with PBL group also performed
   significantly higher for the subjective scale.},

Abstract = {In this study, the effects of inquiry-based learning practices on the
   scientific process skills, creative thinking, and attitudes towards
   science experiments of preservice science teachers have been analyzed. A
   non-experimental quantitative analysis method, the single-group pre test
   posttest design, has been used. In order to observe the scientific skill
   level development of pre-service teachers, the Scientific Process Skills
   Test and experiment worksheets have been used. Furthermore, the Torrance
   Test of Creative Thinking has been used for determining the development
   of creative thinking levels and to specify the development of attitudes
   towards science experiments, the Attitude Scale towards Understanding
   the Purpose of Science Experiments has been used. At the end of the
   study, it was determined that inquiry-based laboratory practices
   improved the scientific process skills and all creative thinking levels
   and attitudes towards science experiments of pre-service science
   teachers.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate mathematics teachers'
   concerns about the reformed 6th grade mathematics curriculum in Turkey
   and to identify the possible relations between teachers' personal
   characteristics and their concerns about the curriculum. 306 in-service
   mathematics teachers teaching in Ankara participated in the study.
   Teachers' concerns about reformed curriculum were identified by
   administration of Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM). Results showed
   that teachers' concerns focused mainly on the personal and collaboration
   stages of the CBAM model. This indicates that the teachers were not
   resistant to the change, though they had some confusion about the
   curriculum; they wanted to learn from what others knew and were doing to
   increase their knowledge and skills about implementation of the reformed
   curriculum.},

Abstract = {A decline in biology interest has often been claimed but seldom with an
   empirically substantiation. This study was based on a sample of 3rd and
   4th grade pupils within the same geographical area as Lowe's (1987,
   1992) previous results from southwest Germany from the year 1983. We
   used a four-point Likert-type questionnaire to assess interest with 30
   items (zoology, botany, human biology). Here we show for the first time,
   that elementary school pupils have lower interest in biology than one
   generation before. This decline between 1983 and 2011 was about 10\%,
   with only 3\% in zoology and 12\% in botany. As interest is an important
   variable, programs should be developed to foster pupils' interest
   already on the primary school level.},

Abstract = {There has been recent concern over the variable quality of science
   teaching in New Zealand primary schools. One reason suggested has been
   the relatively low levels of science education components in initial
   teacher education (ITE) programmes. This paper follows a cohort of
   recent teacher graduates from a science education course in their ITE
   programme through the first two years of their teaching career. Their
   beliefs in science education, their confidence in their science subject
   matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, and use of
   strategies suggested in their ITE science course were explored. It was
   found that the teachers retained their positive views of science in the
   curriculum, and confidence in their ability to teach science grew. The
   use of student and investigation-centred teaching strategies increased
   as the new teachers experienced success with the approaches. These
   outcomes are discussed in light of recent changes in primary curriculum
   emphasis on literacy and numeracy, and ITE science course contractions.},

   of literature for children (picture book, poetic text, story, fairy
   tale, numerator) point out the role of these contents in the process of
   learning and building mathematical concepts in preschool mathematical
   education. The contents from literary for children are viewed as a
   starting point in the work on mathematical education activities whose
   role is to create a real-life context, which is close to the child, in
   which the child is accustomed, in which the child is motivated to
   participate, as content that excites curiosity and interest in learning
   of abstract mathematical concepts, and which visualizes mathematical
   concepts and helps crossing from concrete performances to abstract
   mathematical performances.},

Abstract = {In this study, from the point of the significance of ``spatial
   imagery{''} in spaces, the contributions of graphic design to space were
   explored. Also, the importance and effect of illustrative, photographic,
   typographic and pictographic studies on the spatial imagery have been
   evaluated on the basis of examples. The observations obtained during the
   research showed that illustrations, photographs, typographies and
   pictograms, which have highly expressive language, have turned the space
   into a conceptual medium while presenting design solutions in accordance
   with the function and identity of the space in the creation of the
   spatial image and also positively influenced and directed the human
   behavior in the space. Graphic design solutions were shown with examples
   of architectural elements that create awareness of the space, perceive
   it and create permanent images in mind. The issue was supported by
   comparing the images before and after graphic analysis of sample spaces
   in this research. As a result, it was understood that the spatial images
   created by illustrative, photographic, typographic and pictographic
   analyses, which are the subdisciplines of graphic design, were
   transformed into an environment where they can communicate with the
   users of the space that is an architectural product, and express
   themselves correctly.},

Title = {Surveying Students' Conceptions of Learning Science by Augmented Reality
   and their Scientific Epistemic Beliefs},
Journal = {EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1147-1159},
Abstract = {Previous studies have addressed the positive influences of augmented
   reality (AR) on science learning. However, few studies have explored how
   learners consider learning science by such an emerging technology,
   particularly from the perspectives of conceptions of learning. This
   study therefore aimed to develop a survey to understand students'
   conceptions of learning science by AR (CLSAR) considering their
   demographic characteristics and scientific epistemic beliefs. The CLSAR
   survey was validated by the responses of 267 junior high school
   students. The results indicate that the students generally exhibited
   positive conceptions, with stronger perceptions of learning science by
   AR as increasing motivation and interaction. Although they expressed
   less negative conceptions, their considerations of learning science by
   AR as diminishing learners' imagination about the scientific information
   were stronger than those as interrupting learning. The students' grade
   level played a role in their conceptions, but their gender did not.
   However, when considering the relationships between the students'
   scientific epistemic beliefs and their conceptions, the gender factor
   may interfere with the relations. Based on the findings, some
   suggestions for the development of AR-related science learning systems
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {During the last decades, curriculum reform has been implemented in
   mainland China to emphasize classroom interaction in mathematics
   teaching and learning. The intention to create more chances for
   classroom interaction in large-size classrooms has led to the
   introduction of self-learning guide which allows students to go through
   the learning contents before the classroom learning. This study
   investigates the pedagogical tensions emerging in a mainland Chinese
   mathematics teacher's practices of using self-learning guide to reform
   classroom questioning. The analytical entry point is the examination of
   the IRF (Initiation/Response/Follow-up) structures evident in the
   reform-based mathematics classroom interactions. The results show that,
   by using various reform-based questioning strategies, students were
   given adequate opportunities to present and share their mathematical
   thinking and ideas. The nature of the pedagogical tensions has shifted
   from imbalance of time allocation for classroom discussion and lecturing
   to imbalance of opportunities for guided classroom discussion and
   elaborated classroom discussion.},

Abstract = {Design is a scientific process that incorporates several different
   disciplines and responds to the requirements of the natural environment
   with aesthetics and creativity. Short term ``design studies{''} such as
   studio workshops, symposiums, workshops, student meetings, etc., where
   all disciplines including those based on design and creativity come
   together and various works are presented, are an important part of the
   education process. These include seminars, exhibitions, workshops and
   similar events that are held throughout the world, which are effective
   organizations in the design education process. In the present paper, the
   ``History Narrated with Urban Furniture, Konya / Sille{''} workshop that
   was organized within the context of BAP 01 project no. SBA-2016-5350 at
   Karadeniz Technical University in 2016-2017 academic year was discussed.
   The study was based on the data collected during the workshop activities
   conducted with 20 students. The study aimed to measure of the use of
   technology by the achievements of students in informal design education
   studies that become prevalent in Turkey and worldwide and their
   interaction with formal education based on the collected data. The
   survey results were based on the percentages (\%) with respect to total
   values. Finally, recommendations for future design training events were
   made based on the survey data.},

Abstract = {The enhancement of national living standard and the practice of two-day
   weekend have tourism activity become essential in people's life in
   Taiwan. Along with increasing tourists, it becomes a tough problem in
   the environment load. The ideas of green consumption and even ecotourism
   are therefore successively proposed. However, not every visitor is
   willing to sacrifice the fun and comfort in the tour for environmental
   protection. The effect of environmental measures on visitors' perceived
   play value is therefore analyzed in this study. Visitors to ecological
   touring spots of B\&B in eastern Taiwan are selected as the research
   samples in this study. Total 500 copies of questionnaire are distributed
   and collected on-site, and 412 valid copies are retrieved, with the
   retrieval rate 82\%. The research results are summarized as following:
   (1) Environmental measures present positively significant effects on
   perceived value of tourism. (2) Environmental responsibility shows
   positively remarkable effects on environmental measures. (3)
   Environmental responsibility reveals positively notable effects on
   perceived value of tourism. Finally, suggestions are proposed, expecting
   to help the government, relative departments, and businesses understand
   the cognition and needs of visitors, through the analysis of visitors to
   ecotourism of B\&B, and carefully think and weigh between economy and
   environment.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to provide industrial design students
   with a comprehensive approach of product evaluation during the course of
   a research project. During the design evaluation stage, a student often
   encounters vague information since the attributes of product design
   demands are usually not quantifiable. Therefore, one of the important
   topics during the product development processes is to allow a student to
   carry out design evaluations effectively. The fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy
   Process (AHP) was utilized in this study to assess product designs and
   resolve the problems that might occur during product assessments. The
   purposive sampling technique was used in the questionnaire survey. By
   assigning a weighted value to each of the evaluation criteria, the case
   study verified the feasibility of the proposed design approach in fan
   designs. A total of 52 questionnaire copies were distributed. 36 copies
   of them were collected and the return rate is 77\%. Among them, 28
   copies were from the engineers and 8 copies were from people in the
   relevant industries. 22 copies were from males and this accounts for
   61\%. On the other hand, 14 copies were from females and this accounts
   for 39\%. The results indicated that the weight of efficiency which is
   the secondary constituent element is the highest. Under the constituent
   element of efficiency, the weight of fan flow rate is 0.592 which is the
   highest. The defuzzification of efficiency is 0.744 which is the optimal
   value among the indices of various factors. The defuzzified value of
   Design No. 4 after defuzzification is 0.682 which is the optimal one
   among four design candidates. The results of this study demonstrated the
   feasibility of the proposed design approach. New fan styles can be
   effectively created by implementing this design approach. This approach
   allows the entire evaluation process to be more precise. The combination
   of these approaches is not only practical and objective, but also is
   capable of assisting a student in making a decision under complicated
   and uncertain circumstances. This makes a design task definite and
   better clarified and also enhances a student's learning competitiveness
   by supplying a good reference during the follow-up stage of product
   design assessments.},

Title = {A Comparative Analysis on Cognitive Domain for the Malaysian Primary

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the levels of cognitive
   domains of Malaysian Mathematics primary four textbooks developed under
   the old and new curriculum based on Trends in International Mathematics
   and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015 Mathematics Framework. This study adopted
   content analysis where the mathematical tasks from the textbooks were
   classified in terms of type of tasks and cognitive domain. The results
   of the study showed that a large portion of mathematical tasks in the
   two textbooks are in the `knowing' domain even though improvements have
   been made in the new version of mathematics primary four textbook which
   has more mathematical tasks in `applying' and `reasoning' domain
   compared to the old textbook. The findings of the study suggest the
   structure of Malaysian textbook to be updated to the current world
   changes by increasing the tasks in applying and reasoning domain.
   However, the effort to reduce the gap between the intended curriculum
   and the supporting textbooks need to be carefully planned such that
   students of different abilities can benefit. Meanwhile practitioners
   have to be smart in selecting and providing extra supplementary
   resources to serve the need of their students.},

   developments of the University managerial qualities of employees, their
   cooperation level with students and above all - motivation for creative
   and conscientious work, individual and career development conditions,

   following dependence of students: combination of work and study duties
   increased the frequency of stress cases and ill health, but increased

Abstract = {Mass media, which is used not only to reach many people easily but also
   to inform, direct, influence and educate people, is the most important
   devices of the 21st Century. Cinema, which is used to educate people, as
   well as to entertain, influence and direct them, is accepted and used as
   the most important cultural conveyor of the 21st century. Cinema has the
   feature of reflecting the social, political and cultural changes and of
   contributing to reconstruction of reality. As a result of the political
   processes and crises in countries, the incompatibility of the social
   structure has brought the issue of distrust of the people against
   politics and politicians. This study focuses on how cinema may play role
   on educational patters of individuals and can even affect politicians to
   protect their legitimacy. This effect is searched by discourse analysis
   to find whether politician's education level is significant on the
   public within the perspective of films. The study analyses the film
   ``Hasip and Nasip{''} as the case study which gave the most important
   and distinctive examples of `politician representation' in the period
   between two coups.},

Abstract = {In order to drive private capital to participate in venture capital
   investment, public capital takes equity as the incentive, to give
   private capital profit transfer and compensation when making profits and
   losses respectively. This form has option characteristics, which make
   the public capital's income change along with the project value, equity
   stake negotiation during making profits and losses, and shown its
   uncertainty. In order to reveal the public capital income and its
   influencing factors under the guidance fund mode, this paper established
   the public capital income model under the guidance fund mode, estimated
   the real option value of the public capital income under the guidance
   fund mode, and reach a conclusion that when the invested project makes
   profits, public capital income is only affected by the profit transfer
   equity share proportion, and if the profit transfer equity is higher,
   the public capital income will be less; when the invested project
   suffers losses, public capital income is only affected by the
   compensation proportion, and if the compensation proportion is higher,
   the public capital income will be less. When the invested project makes
   profits, and public capital transferred equity stake proportion is less
   than compensated equity stake proportion, then the income public capital
   get will always higher than that under making losses condition; and when
   the invested project makes profits, and the public capital equity stake
   transferred profit is more than compensated equity stake proportion, the
   public capital income will be higher than that in making losses
   condition only when the invested project value is higher than a certain
   threshold value; and when the invested project suffers losses, and the
   public capital transferred profit is more than compensated proportion,
   the income that public capital get will be higher than that in making
   profit condition only when invested project value is higher than another
   threshold value. Finally, this paper will further verify this conclusion
   according to related numerical simulation.},

Abstract = {The development of online journalism has generated a convergent media
   environment. This study is based on the assumption that the development
   of this new form of journalism plays a pivotal role in the
   transformation of the dynamics of professional practices, news
   production process as well as audience use and participation. It
   concentrates on investigating how and the extent to which this role is
   observed and can be explained in the context of Northern Cyprus. In this
   regard, it is argued that the prevalent journalism education curriculum
   offered in universities should be structured and diversified to include
   online journalism. Consequently, such will enable an increased focus on
   this environment in which multimedia opportunities, interactivity and
   hypertext possibilities can be found. On the other hand, while the
   concept of `Citizen Journalism' has increased in parallel with the
   widespread use of new media opportunities such as social media; the
   findings in the present study suggest that the education on internet
   technology should be spread throughout the different social layers of
   society.},

Abstract = {This research proposes theoretical and methodological recommendations
   that would develop search and research skills applied by prospective
   math teachers while teaching a course on mathematical physics equations.
   The research findings include the first-ever attempt to set up and solve
   the challenge of developing students' search and research skills when
   being taught a course on mathematical physics equations through a
   specially developed methodology. The authors propose a structural
   content model of search and research skills, and define the types of
   mathematical problems that facilitate the development of search and
   research skills used by prospective math teachers when teaching a course
   on mathematical physics equations.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper lies in elaborating the methodology for
   assessing the development of managerial competences trained with the use
   of case technology as one of the inherent educational technologies. The
   principle research method is the pedagogical experiment with three
   control groups of students; the authors also applied the methods of
   systematization and generalization of the obtained data, expert
   assessment and interpretation of the study results, which helped to
   elaborate and test the scientific and methodological tools for assessing
   the development of students' managerial competence. The experiment
   involved 68 students of the Master's Degree program in Hospitality, 2040
   assessments of competence levels were performed. Results: The paper
   reveals the essence of the methodology for assessing the development of
   managerial competences in university students taught with the use of
   case-technologies. The authors present their own rating scale for
   assessing the development of the managerial competences indicated in the
   professional standard for ``Head/Manager of hotel complex/hotel
   chain{''} in Master's Degree students majoring in Hospitality. The
   results prove the effectiveness of using case-technologies for
   developing students' managerial competence, the effectiveness of
   different types of cases (creative, structured, and unstructured) is
   specified. The challenges of using case-technologies are identified, and
   recommendations for their use are suggested. The methodology for
   assessing the development of managerial competences in university
   students taught with the use of case-technologies elaborated by the
   authors can be used in educational programs in different fields of the
   Humanities. The difference of this methodology from the existing ones
   lies in its orientation at both the educational standards and the
   professional standards for heads of enterprises which emerged in Russia
   in the past 5 years. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has
   been proved by high correlation of the research results obtained in
   different institutions and by different experts -University professors
   and employers.},

Abstract = {Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is a crucial skill for students and
   people entering the workforce. Hence, an online CPS assessment system
   was developed for the Programme for International Student Assessment to
   test 12 CPS skills. This study compared the CPS skills of students on
   the basis of a CPS assessment developed for science scenarios in Taiwan.
   Moreover, a sequential analysis was applied to explore the Sehavioral
   patterns of students with CPS skills. The results demonstrated that most
   Taiwanese students are proficient in the 11 CPS skills (except for D3:
   ``Monitoring, providing feedback and adapting the team organisation and
   roles{''}), and that female students are significantly more proficient
   than male students. The results also indicated that most students can
   successfully transition between CPS skills. However, the students in a
   given class may demonstrate a lack of behavioral patterns. Teachers can
   design activities and develop strategies to address this lack of
   behavioral patterns and thus increase students' CPS skills and
   behavioral patterns.},

Abstract = {With the promotion and application of high-tech in large-scale
   manufacturing, aerospace, machinery manufacturing, medical equipment,
   biotechnology enterprises, enterprises have increasingly growing demand
   for high-quality skilled personnel, while practical talents are in great
   shortage, and embarrassing situation of ``no recruitable talent{''} is
   often a case. Practical education reflects the real demand of national
   economic development and reform. In-depth analysis of the current
   development status of practical education model in colleges and
   universities reveals practical problems such as rigid education system,
   lack of platform resources and detachment from practical demand.
   Therefore, it is necessary to build a good practical educational and
   cultural environment from the three levels of thought, system and
   teaching. Efforts should be made to improve practice teaching platform,
   comprehensively enhance ``order-oriented{''} talent training, adhere to
   the employment-oriented, scientific and practical evaluation system as a
   guarantee, make comprehensive innovation in practical education model
   and improve teaching quality. It is necessary to build a strong inner
   support structure from the aspects of thought, system and teaching, to
   improve educational and cultural environment from thought, system,
   teaching, and accelerate the reconstruction of practical educational
   innovation practice platform. Centering on construction goal of

Abstract = {This study examines the relation of audit knowledge and accounting
   conservatism based on the case of executives' vocational learning and
   application. The empirical results reveal the evidence of a negative
   relation between executives' audit knowledge and accounting
   conservatism. Further analysis indicates that the impact of executives'
   audit knowledge on accounting conservatism is only robust in companies
   without CEO duality. The results imply that companies with executives
   who have audit knowledge may adopt aggressive accounting policy and
   reduce the accounting conservatism of financial reports.},

Abstract = {In the 21st century, the major competitiveness of a country lies in the
   talents whose power generated from knowledge would become the most
   powerful tool, especially the knowledge and competitiveness resulted
   from e-learning. Aiming at the departments in Kaohsiung City Government,
   Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to the efficiency assessment
   of e-learning, in which Delphi Method is utilized for selecting inputs,
   including number of employees, invested costs, management expenses, and
   output of yearly performance assessment. Sensitivity Analysis is further
   applied to acquiring the departments with the best efficiency, and
   individual departments with management efficiency are also analyzed. The
   research outcomes show that 1. ten departments in Kaohsiung City
   Government with constant returns to scale achieve the optimization in
   e-learning efficiency, 2. two departments appear decreasing returns to
   scale that decreasing the scale might be able to enhance the marginal
   returns and improve the e-learning efficiency, and 3. eleven departments
   present increasing returns to scale, showing that the scale could be
   enlarged to enhance the marginal returns and further promote the
   efficiency.},

   analysis. After qualitative analysis, we use factor analysis and
   regression analysis to analyze the statistical results of
   questionnaires. The effective questionnaires returned rate of this
   research is 282/300(94\%). The analysis results of Likert scale show
   that Cronbach's a for 5 factors are all higher than 0.7 which means the
   reliability of this research is good. The result of regression analysis
   also shows that significance of green marketing via the IoT for
   consumers' green education is obviously effective. This research
   presents an indispensable and interesting education way to create a
   multi-win situation for businesses, consumers, governments and our

Abstract = {This research studies whether the environmental attitudes and behaviors
   of Libyan and Turkish students studying in the universities of N. Cyprus
   are efficient or not. The study aims to get information about the
   relationship between these attitudes and behaviours of the students and
   the classes and departments they study in, and to make a general
   evaluation about efficiency and effectiveness of the environmental
   education in our country. The data obtained from the results of the
   survey were evaluated by using SPSS20 program. According to the findings
   obtained from the research, there has been found an meaningful
   differences in environmental attitudes among Libyan and Turkish
   students, studying in the universities of Northern Cyprus. However, no
   meaningful differences in their behaviors. It can be said that the
   students from Libya have a higher attitude level than the students from
   Turkey. When we look at the answers, we understood that they have
   efficient environmental knowledge.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a study on students' science manipulative skills at
   the lower secondary school level. Students' manipulative skills can be
   explored by understanding their technical skills and their functional
   aspects of performing experiment. However, this paper will focus on
   students' technical skills in using basic scientific apparatus.
   Technical skills in this study refer to skill, abilities, and knowledge
   required for accomplishing a specific task in the laboratory. The skills
   include knowledge and skills needed to properly manipulate and operate
   scientific apparatus when executing a scientific task. It was found that
   students perform the skills in a certain pattern that reflects a form of
   hierarchy. This hierarchy can be used to aid science teachers in
   teaching manipulative skills. The paper will present the hierarchy of
   these technical skills and discuss these skills specifically from the
   perspective of lower secondary science teaching and learning. The
   results of this study have provided an insight on the issue of science
   manipulative skills that supports the importance of practical work.},

Abstract = {Advances and accessibility of Internet services around the world have
   transformed the traditional classroom learning into web-based e-learning
   systems. In recent years, designing adaptive e-learning systems has
   become one of striking topic of discussions in the literature.
   Additionally, integrating such systems with intelligent and adaptive
   systems that can measure the learning preferences of the user can enable
   learners to obtain the most suitable learning objects that might be
   matched with their learning styles. Moreover, even in the classroom
   teaching, knowing the learning styles of students can also help teachers
   to adopt appropriate learning materials for efficient learning. This
   paper is concerned with the study, implementation, and application of a
   web-based learning style index. The paper also described a case study on
   the integration of the learning style index into an adaptive and
   intelligent e-learning system.},

Abstract = {Technology Enhanced Language Learning (TELL) via e-learning systems and
   the Internet, encourages language learners to develop language ability
   in a more effective way. The flipped classroom is one of the
   contemporary pedagogical methods. This research experimented with an
   innovative flipped classroom approach in an undergraduate English
   learning course for specific purposes, along with investigated the value
   of using flipped classroom strategy. In the new instructional model of
   flipped classroom, it further provided a more effective connection
   between traditional flipped in-class and out-of-class activities via
   other on-line learning activities from school's eLearning platform. This
   research aims to identify whether this innovative approach is a positive
   experience for students. The findings indicate that the impact on the
   student experience is significantly positive and with a higher level of
   satisfaction by students especially for those students who have TOEIC
   test experience before. Moreover, the further on-line tutoring and
   supporting resource were also addressed in a positive learning
   experience. This paper offers implementation recommendations for an
   innovative flipped curriculum and materials design for ESL/EFL teachers
   in ESP.},

Abstract = {Education poverty alleviation is an endogenous mechanism to explore
   poverty alleviation in contiguous poverty-stricken areas, which is an
   important support for the implementation of precision poverty
   alleviation strategy, and it is the key path to change ``blood
   transfusion poverty alleviation{''} as ``hematopoietic poverty
   alleviation{''}. It is of great significance to solve employment,
   stimulate economic growth and promote the income of poor households.
   Lvliang mountain area is the famous old revolutionary base in China, and
   it is one of the fourteen contiguous poverty-stricken areas that the
   country focus on poverty alleviation during the 13th five-year plan,
   accounting for one-third of the total number of poor people in Shanxi.
   To promote education and knowledge poverty alleviation and get out of
   poverty, it not only need to make full use of the power of culture and
   the means of knowledge to implement the knowledge poverty alleviation
   project, achieving the goal of ``taking the lead in poverty alleviation
   and taking the lead to get rich{''}. And it also need to work closely
   with governments at all levels and the people in the poverty-stricken
   areas to combine the top-level design and concrete measures.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the criteria of
   didactical suitability, proposed by the theoretical framework known as
   the Onto-Semiotic Approach (OSA) of mathematical knowledge and
   instruction, are powerful tools for organizing the reflection and
   assessment of instruction processes carried out by mathematics teachers.
   To this aim, the results of a multiple case study are presented which
   prove that when teachers are faced with the task of evaluating processes
   of instruction, they employ-either implicitly or explicitly-the OSA
   criteria of didactical suitability (epistemic, cognitive, affective,
   mediational, interactional and ecological). Therefore, the explicit
   application of said criteria in teachers' education cycles contributes
   to the development of the didactic analysis competence that is necessary
   for teachers to be able to reflect on their own practices.},

Abstract = {Grit, one of the newly developed non-cognitive traits, encompasses the
   characteristics of perseverance and consistency of interest. Grit is
   associated with good academic performance, resilience, and well-being.
   To understand the nature of Grit in detail, this study probed the
   relationship between Grit and the widely-applied and well-established
   Big-Five personality. Family context plays a significant role in
   nurturing all aspects of personality traits. Accordingly, we examined
   two family-context variables, namely family influence and democratic
   parenting style, which may be predictive of Grit, particularly in an
   Asian context.
   A total of 1504 students from one private comprehensive high school
   participated. Multiple linear regression was conducted to determine how
   the various independent variables affect Grit characteristics. The
   results indicate that grittier high school learners tend to display
   higher self-report academic performance and academic satisfaction.
   Multiple regression demonstrated that the four Big-Five personality
   traits: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism,
   Intellect/Imagination, are significantly predictive of Grit, with the
   exception of Extraversion. While family influence is predictive of Grit,
   democratic parenting style does not predict Grit. Based on the results,
   several possible explanations and suggestions are proposed.},

Abstract = {The present study assessed a short training experiment to improve
   spatial abilities using two tools based on virtual technologies: one
   focused on manipulation of specific geometric virtual pieces, and the
   other consisting of virtual orienteering game. The two tools can help
   improve spatial abilities required for many engineering problem-solving
   procedures. The results indicated that training activities improved the
   components of space ability (mental rotation, spatial visualization, and
   spatial orientation). In addition, it was concluded that there were no
   differences between men and women with respect to spatial ability levels
   before or after the training experiment. This fact resulted from masked
   training relating to daily living and leisure activities that are
   usually indistinctly performed by men and women in developed and
   industrialized countries.},

Abstract = {As 21st century skills (e.g., creativity and collaboration) are
   informally developed by tech-savvy learners in the Digital Age,
   technology-based strategies to develop such skills in non-formal and
   formal contexts are necessary to reduce the gap between academic and
   business organizations on the one hand, and the revolutionary wave of
   self-taught networked learners on the other. In light of this, the
   Gradual Immersion Method (GIM) was designed to enhance collaborative
   creativity using interactive devices and augmented reality (AR), to
   support creativity-based learning, such as in the integrated study of
   Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM). The GIM
   consists of three intuitive modules wherein learners collaboratively
   achieve learning object goals through interaction with images and 3D
   models, in a sequential transition from 2D to 3D and then to AR. In this
   paper, the process is illustrated through the deployment of the GIM in
   the study of Surrealist art features, using the Art Movement Learning
   App (AMLA), an area-specific technological solution based on the GIM,
   designed as foundation architecture for the investigation of a wide
   range of topics in an interactive manner.},

Abstract = {While much is known about the high academic but low affective
   achievement of Korean students on international comparative studies,
   little is known about science teacher education in Korea. As the quality
   of science teachers is an important factor determining the quality of
   science education, gaining an understanding of science education in
   Korea necessitates understanding the science teacher education system
   and the ways of leveraging quality science teacher preparation. Korea
   has a unique science teacher education system in many aspects due to its
   unique socio-cultural background. This study critically reviews the
   current state of the science teacher education system in South Korea in
   terms of the outcomes and institutional backgrounds, such as associated
   law and policy, teacher education curriculum, recruiting system and
   examinations. A careful review is conducted of the previous literature,
   official documents and statistics from the Korean government, and
   curricular documents from some teacher education institutions. The paper
   concludes with a discussion on the uprising issues in science teacher
   education within the socio-cultural context of Korea and offers
   implications to the international science education community.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore the relationships among performance
   expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition,
   behavioral intention and use behavior of university physical education
   students in Taiwan. Moreover, it also intends to examine the moderating
   effects of gender, age, and experience on the UTAUT model. The targets
   were 19 universities in Taiwan by purposive sampling. A total of 760
   questionnaires were distributed and 707 were returned, with a returning
   rate of 93\%. The data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 and Warp PLS 5.0.
   The results showed that on the UTAUT model, performance expectancy,
   social influence, and facilitating condition variables are positively
   related to behavioral intention; behavioral intention is positively
   related to use behavior; gender, age, and experiences played a
   moderating role on the model. The empirical results can provide useful
   reference regarding the explanatory power of the UTAUT model on
   university physical education students' usage intention toward social

Abstract = {This study is aimed to construct a model to transform word ``motion
   problems{''} in to an algorithmic form in order to be processed by an
   intelligent tutoring system (ITS). First; categorizing the
   characteristics of motion problems, second; suggesting a model for the
   categories were carried out. In order to solve all categories of the
   problems, graph theory including backward and forward chaining
   techniques of artificial intelligence were utilized. The study outlines
   the adoption of graph theory in to the motion problems and put forth
   some evidence that the model solves almost all of the motion problems.
   In conclusion, the recommended model can be suggested to be used in
   educational software in the problem solving context.},

Abstract = {This study proposed an analytic framework for coding students' dialogic
   argumentation and investigated the characteristics of the small-group
   argumentation pattern observed in modeling-based learning. The
   participants were 122 second grade high school students in South Korea
   divided into an experimental and a comparison group. Modeling-based
   learning was applied to the experimental group in a topic of apparent
   motion of Mars on the other hand, explanation-based classes led by a
   teacher were provided to the comparison group with the same topic.
   Students created a paper model of Mars retrograde motion and learned
   through small-group discussion about the astronomical phenomena which is
   represented by the created model and the reason that caused these
   phenomena. The analytic framework for coding students' argumentation in
   the modeling-based learning was composed into eight components and three
   categories including model-related statement, claim and reasoning. The
   results showed that a variety of model exploration is essential for
   useful argumentation which includes the reasoning added with the claims.
   By investigating the time sequential pattern of the argumentation, a
   process of argumentation frequently cross all three categories was
   revealed as an effective pattern in modeling-based learning.
   Additionally, the results of comparing the concepts of apparent motion
   of Mars in the experimental group and comparison group, the ratio of
   students with correct concepts of the experimental group was higher than
   those of the comparison group. The implication of these finding for
   modeling-based learning environment, productive modeling discourse are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Inability to link the acid-base concepts with daily life phenomena (as
   contexts) highlights the need for further research on the context-based
   acid-base chemistry. In this vein, the aim of this study is to
   investigate the effects of different teaching designs (REACT strategy,
   5Es learning model and traditional (existing) instruction) relevant with
   `acids and bases' subject on pre-service science teachers' conceptions
   and attitudes towards chemistry and to compare them with each other.
   Within quasi-experimental research design, the sample comprised of 95
   pre-service science teachers from Faculty of Education in Giresun
   University, Turkey. Three intact groups were randomly assigned as either
   experimental and control groups. To gather data, Acid-Base Chemistry
   Concept Test (ABCCT), Chemistry Attitudes and Experiences Questionnaire
   (CAEQ) and semi-structured interviews were used. The results denote that
   REACT strategy is effective in helping the pre-service science teachers
   retain their gained conceptions in long-term memory whilst 5Es learning
   model is efficient in achieving conceptual learning. Finally, future
   studies should test the effects of REACT strategy and 5Es learning model
   on different variables (i.e. sample, subject, scientific process skills,
   scientific inquiry) over a longer period of time (i.e. one semester or
   one-year).},

Abstract = {This research study aims at exploring the use of some dimensions and
   theoretical-methodological tools suggested by the model of
   Didactic-Mathematical Knowledge (DMK) for the analysis, characterization
   and development of knowledge that teachers should have in order to
   efficiently develop within their practice. For this purpose, we analyzed
   the activity performed by five high school teachers, in relation to an
   activity about patterns suggested in the framework of the Master of
   Mathematics Education Program at University of Los Lagos, Chile. As a
   result of the analysis, it becomes evident that teachers can indeed
   solve items related to the common content knowledge, but have certain
   difficulties when they face items that aim at exploring other dimensions
   of their knowledge, for example, about extended content knowledge, of
   resources and means, or of the affective state of students.},

Abstract = {Despite the relevance of nature of science and scientific models in
   science education, studies reveal that students do not possess adequate
   views regarding these topics. Bearing in mind that both teachers' views
   and knowledge strongly influence students' educational experiences, the
   main scope of this study was to evaluate Portuguese prospective
   teachers' views of nature of science, models and earth's structure
   models and to analyse if their views differ (by comparing prospective
   primary teachers' with prospective middle and secondary school teachers'
   views). A questionnaire was applied to 65 prospective science teachers
   who were enrolled in different Portuguese institutions of higher
   education. Descriptive analysis showed that although the majority of the
   participants revealed intermediate views of nature of science, a high
   percentage of them hold uninformed views regarding the other topics of
   analysis. Some differences between prospective middle and secondary
   teachers' views and prospective primary teachers' views were also found.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the design, development, validation, and
   psychometric properties of the Children's Environmental Affect Scale
   (CEAS). The following steps were taken in developing the CEAS. A
   substantial review of literature on environmental affect and EL helped
   the researchers identify several scales and questionnaires that, in
   turn, help establish the item pool. The initial scale derived from this
   item pool was reviewed by the selected experts (n=17) and then pilot
   tested with 673 students in 4th -5th grades. These pilot data were
   subjected to Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) to reveal the dimensions
   underlying these pilot items. Later, the revised version of the scale
   was administrated to 2412 students in 5th grade as part of a national
   assessment. The data from this full study were used to validate the
   factorial structure observed in EFA through using Confirmatory Factor
   Analysis (CFA) procedures in AMOS. The final version of the CEAS employs
   a Likert-type scale to measure 14 items that reflect three sub-scales;
   Willingness to take environmental action (5 items, alpha=.87),
   Environmental Attitudes (5 items, alpha=.82) and Environmental
   Sensitivity (4 items, alpha=.67).},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate how learning materials
   based on Science Magic activities affect student attitudes to science. A
   quasi-experimental design was conducted to explore the combination of
   Science Magic with the 5E Instructional Model to develop learning
   materials for teaching a science unit about friction. The participants
   were recruited from among the students of a middle school in central
   Taiwan. Based on our results, we conclude that our combined teaching
   method involving Science Magic activities and the 5E Instructional Model
   is effective for developing learning materials for teaching, and that
   this method improves students' attitudes toward science.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify 7th grade students' common
   mistakes and/or misconceptions about representing rational numbers in
   different forms. Seventy-three 7th grade students participated in this
   study. We utilized a diagnostic test with 8 questions in order to
   determine common student mistakes. For identifying misconceptions, we
   conducted interviews with 25 of the participants purposefully chosen
   from among the ones who made mistakes more frequently. The data analysis
   showed that students had difficulties especially in determining rational
   numbers, relating rational numbers with decimals, representing rational
   numbers, and rational-number division. Moreover, the current study also
   revealed students' misconceptions about dividing by zero and division of
   integers (with + - signs). The results suggest that using concrete
   materials and multiple representations would be more beneficial for

Abstract = {Articles from the National Science Teacher Association (NSTA)
   publications were analyzed to investigate resources available for
   teachers who want to implement interdisciplinary approaches into the
   science classroom. All articles in each journal from 2004 through 2008
   were read an analyzed; approximately 13\% of Science \& Children
   (elementary), 21\% of Science Scope (middle), and 17\% of The Science
   Teacher (high school) articles met the interdisciplinary approach
   criteria. Results show that overall, reading, writing, art, and
   technology are the subjects most commonly integrated into science.
   Surprisingly, math is rarely discussed across all school levels.
   Comparing the articles across different school levels, Science Scope
   articles have the highest number of integrated articles, whereas The
   Science Teacher had the fewest number of integrated articles.},

Abstract = {In Australia we are at a crossroads in science education. We have come
   from a long history of adopting international curricula, through to
   blending international and Australian developed materials, to the
   present which is a thoroughly unique Australian curriculum in science.
   This paper documents Australia's journey over the past 200 years, as we
   prepare for the implementation of our first truly Australian National
   Curriculum. One of the unique aspects of this curriculum is the emphasis
   on practical work and inquiry-based learning. This paper identifies
   seven forms of practical work currently used in Australian schools and
   the purposes aligned with each form by 138 pre-service and experienced
   in-service teachers. The paper explores the question What does the
   impending national curriculum, with its emphasis on practical inquiry
   mean to the teachers now - are they ready?' The study suggests that
   practical work in Australian schools is multifaceted, and the
   teacher-aligned purposes are dependent not only upon the age of the
   student, but also on the type of practical work being undertaken. It was
   found that most teachers are not ready to teach using inquiry-based
   pedagogy and cite lack of content knowledge, behaviour management, lack
   of physical resources and availability of classroom space as key issues
   which will hinder their implementation of the inquiry component of
   Australia's pending curriculum in science.},

   Mathematics Cognitive Achievement?},

Abstract = {Some previous research has reported the effectiveness of RME in
   improving students' problem solving ability and cognitive achievement.
   This quasi experimental research, therefore, aimed to investigate the
   difference in students' mathematics cognitive achievement after
   implementing RME and conventional learning. The controlled treatment
   consisted of mathematics learning with RME equipped with snake and
   ladder board game and conventional learning. Instrument measuring
   students' cognitive achievement was developed by the researcher and
   validated by some experts prior to the research. The results of the
   t-test confirmed the difference in students' cognitive achievement both
   of the experimental and control group. The students who were taught with
   RME achieved better than the students who were involved in conventional
   learning. This research finding has suggested that it is important for
   teachers to empower students' intellectual ability through RME and games
   in order that meaningful and contextual learning can be generated. It is
   recommended that future research will explore the effect of RME on
   students' attitude, problem-solving ability, learning interest, or other
   variables related to mathematics learning.},

Abstract = {This article presents some results of a qualitative-case study carried
   out with students in last year of secondary education (15 - 17 years)
   into an official educational institution. The research looked at
   learning outcomes through the development of mathematical modelling
   projects related to studying the distribution of the leaves and the
   growth of some plants. According to the results, when modelling projects
   grounded in studying the form and geometric magnitudes are carried out,
   students are able to find out the meaning of certain mathematical
   concepts and participate in activities to reach other processes such as
   exploration, representation, formal construction, and validation of
   mathematical results. Some implications for teaching and learning in
   classroom derive from this study, particularly, the need for students to
   face the project development articulating research and mathematical
   modelling.},

Abstract = {With the growth of the knowledge economy, organizations have found that
   the value of an organization is not just the financial capital of an
   organization but also its intellectual capital. Since intellectual
   capital is an intangible asset, identification of its indicators and its
   variables from the financial and cost perspective has become a challenge
   for managers. This has increased the importance of intellectual capital
   as research and economic categories. Due to the role of intellectual
   capital spending in the value added of organizations, this topic is the
   subject of new research. The purpose of this study is to identify
   intellectual capital variables based on cost indices in the Iranian
   educational technology. Therefore, firstly, cost indicators that are
   effective are found, then a questionnaire based on the Likert scale is
   developed. Exploratory factor analysis has been used to extract factors.
   After performing the factor analysis, the indicators are classified into
   nine categories. According to the extracted factors, 9 factors are
   classified into 3 groups. Confirmatory factor analysis has been used to
   confirm this categorization. For this purpose, all the statistical
   indices introduced by the experts in this field have been presented to
   confirm the model. The results of this research show that human capital
   dimension includes 4 factors, structural capital dimension includes 3
   factors, and dimension of relational capital includes 2 factors in
   intellectual capital of Iranian educational technology.},

Abstract = {This study explored problem-solving in middle school, focusing on how
   students use tools to solve problems when working on mathematical tasks.
   The Problem-solving Assessment, Diagnosis, and Remedial Instruction
   (PSADRI) system was designed and developed as an individual teaching
   tool to support mathematics education, foster students' ability to solve
   problems. A quasi-experimental design was conducted during five weeks.
   The 153 students who participated in this experiment were divided into
   an experimental group (86 students who used the PSADRI system) and a
   control group (67 students who received traditional instruction). The
   results revealed that the students who used the PSADRI system achieved
   greater learning performances in mathematics and improved
   problem-solving ability compared with the students who received
   traditional instruction. Using the question-guided training function in
   the system, the students in the experimental group used the
   drill-and-practice strategy to solve math problems step by step to
   achieve mastery in mathematics learning. Moreover, the students'
   learning performance in the experimental group was enhanced and their
   problem-solving ability was improved. The major contributions of this
   study were the improvement in middle school students' academic
   achievement in mathematics and problem-solving ability and enhanced
   interest in mathematics learning via the PSADRI system, an individual
   teaching system.},

Abstract = {The volume of existing buildings is much more than new buildings in
   developed countries. Applying new technology, new material and new
   equipment to renovate and make the existing buildings greener is crucial
   for sustainable development. An approach including current energy
   statistics survey, expert diagnosis, energy and economic simulation
   using eQUEST model is carried out in this research for an existing
   office building in Taipei City. A sustainable renovation scheme with a
   payback period of 5.75 years is proposed in this research. Lessons
   learned from this research can be further developed into a decision
   support system to assist existing office building diagnosis and
   sustainable renovation in a subtropical area.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a method for two-sided matching decision in the
   environment of incomplete indifferent order relations. The two-sided
   matching decision problem with incomplete indifferent order relations
   and matching aspirations is firstly described. In order to solve this
   problem, the incomplete indifferent order relations are converted into
   the generalized Borda number matrices. The matching aspiration matrix
   can be determined based on the model calculation on the reciprocal
   differences of generalized Borda numbers. On this basis, the weighted
   satisfaction degree matrices are set up. The extended relative closeness
   matrices are determined by using an extended TOPSIS technique. Moreover,
   a two-sided matching model is developed. The two-sided matching
   alternative can be obtained by solving the model. For the purpose of
   illustration, an example including sensitivity analysis is presented.},

Abstract = {This study aims at developing information technology to support the
   synthesis of scenarios for vocational guidance and workers'
   rehabilitation based on collective expert knowledge integration.
   Collective expert knowledge is formalized by the conceptual modeling
   method. The functionally targeted approach enables the integration of
   collective expert knowledge at the stage of creating a conceptual model.
   The authors' technologies for the synthesis of control algorithms based
   on the conceptual model are applied to synthesize and select scenarios
   for vocational guidance and workers' rehabilitation. The application of
   the functionally targeted approach at the synthesis stage ensures the
   adequacy of relevant synthesized scenarios. Tree structures used in the
   functionally targeted approach are convenient for experts and allow them
   to build a hierarchical description of the main objects, processes, and
   relationships of the studied system in terms of the subject domain. This
   approach allows for rationally justified synthesis, and choice of
   psycho-physiological rehabilitation scenarios from the perspective of
   vocational rehabilitation goals.},

Abstract = {Aim to establish a scientific and reasonable quality evaluation method
   of pharmacy open experimental teaching mode. Method The pharmacy open
   experiment is embodied in the forms of amateurism, nature of curriculum
   and graduation design; three different forms of quality evaluation
   system are established according to the three different forms of open
   experimental teaching. Results The established quality evaluation system
   of pharmacy open experimental teaching mode breaks the traditional
   single evaluation mode; embodies the student-oriented educational
   thought; and also conduces to improve the enthusiasm and proactivity of
   students to participate in the experiment, achieve teaching objectives,
   and increase teaching quality. Conclusion The research also has certain
   enlightening effect on the reform of assessment and evaluation mode of
   pharmacy open experimental teaching of higher education in China.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to analyse the reactions of university
   students in situations where they experience stress in order to create a
   psychological counselling program with a group based on Rational
   Emotional, Behavioural, Cognitive and Existential Approaches in order to
   improve the ability of first year students studying in the Counselling
   and Psychological Guidance and Preschool Teaching Department to cope
   with stress. The study examined the behaviours and thoughts of students
   in the context of these reactions as to the situations in which they
   experienced and believed to experience stress. In the study,
   face-to-face interviews were conducted on 45 students in the Counselling
   and Psychological Guidance and Pre-School Teaching Departments by using
   the semi-structured interview form developed by the researcher. Data
   were collected on the perceptions and the stress experienced or believed
   to be experienced by the interviewed university students, who formed the
   study group, and their thoughts and behaviours in line with these cases.
   The data obtained from the interviews were analysed by content analysis.
   It has been revealed that the first year students in Guidance and
   Psychological Counselling and Preschool Teaching Departments usually
   produced negative thoughts against the stress experienced within the
   university life and their behaviours appeared in the form of falling
   academic performance and avoidance in social relations.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to explain the validity and reliability of the
   SCAS translated into Turkish language, as well as testing the validity
   of the 6-factor model among the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
   (TRNC) population. The sampling group consists of 461 students studying
   in the 4th and 5th grade of 11 primary schools selected randomly among
   112 primary schools in Northern Cyprus under the Ministry of National
   Education. 48.80\% of these students were female (N = 225) and 51.20\%
   were male (N = 236). The age of the children ranged from 9 to 12 (X =
   9.89, S = 0.69). Exploratory factor analysis was used in order to assess
   the validity produced by the six-factor model. The confirmatory factor
   analysis results with six-factor model resulted in a good fit to the
   data. The Cronbach's Alpha value of the scale was 83 and the split half
   value was .80. The correlation between the social phobia scores, which
   is a sub-scale of SCAS, and Social Anxiety Scale for Children was
   studied and it was observed that the correlation coefficient was found
   as .523 (p <. 001). The MANOVA revealed a significant multivariate main
   effect of the gender. These results suggested that girls had
   significantly higher levels of anxiety, social phobia and physical
   injury fear symptoms compared to boys. The results obtained in the study
   have demonstrated that SCAS has strong psychometric properties. The
   study on the Turkish version of the scale has provided psychometric
   information about the fact that the scale can be used in our country.},

Abstract = {High-tech industry plays the role of motivator in the economic
   development in Taiwan, revealing that high-tech industry is not simply
   the most important breadwinner in Taiwan, but also the powerful backing
   of national competitive advantage under the globally competitive system.
   High-tech industry requires the engagement of excellent talents, but the
   staff turnover rate is commonly high. A lot of businesses therefore
   apply employee bonus and the high development of high-tech industry as
   the incentives to recruit and retain talents. In this case, it is
   important for high-tech industry understanding the factor in employee
   bonus and further discussing the relationship among current corporate
   governance mechanism, professional education, and employee bonus for the
   sustainable development. Taking domestic listed high-tech companies as
   the research objects, the database of Taiwan Economic Journal and Taiwan
   Patent Gazette are the data sources to collect the companies' financial
   statement, patent, and stock price data for the empirical research. The
   research results conclude the significantly positive correlations
   between 1) corporate governance and employee bonus, 2) professional
   education and corporate governance, and 3) professional education and
   employee bonus. Finally, conclusion and suggestions are proposed,
   expecting to assist high-tech businesses in promoting the employee bonus
   system.},

Abstract = {Animals are the most prevalent subjects for photographs in science
   textbooks. Many of them are potentially dangerous to humans, and visual
   exposure to potential threat can influence learning outcomes as well as
   emotional attachment to these animals. We experimentally investigated
   the influence of animal posture (aggressive-looking vs. neutral-looking)
   on 10 - 13-year-old pupils' information retention and willingness to
   support the protection of these animals. We found that information
   placed below aggressive-looking animals was retained significantly
   better than information placed below neutral-looking animals.
   Survival-relevant information was retained better than
   survival-irrelevant information. Willingness to protect
   aggressive-looking animals was lower than willingness to protect
   neutral-looking animals. This suggests that aggressive-looking pictures
   receive stronger attention, but do not distract pupils from learning.
   Aggressive animals may have a negative influence on animal conservation
   efforts.},

Abstract = {The modernization of the current education system, socio-economic shifts
   in society and increasing migration call for changes in teacher
   education as today's teachers need to be mobile, adaptable and capable
   of anticipating and neutralizing negative factors that arise from
   various risk factors in the field of education. In view of this we argue
   that noxological preparation is an important component in teacher
   education. In this study our main objective is (1) to identify the
   problematic areas in the psycho-pedagogical and methodological
   components of teacher education in a multicultural setting and (2) to
   test the effectiveness of simulation technologies in preparing teachers
   to deal with risks. Our main research methods were pedagogical modeling
   and the project-based approach which enabled us to create a model of
   working students in problem-focused groups with the use of simulation
   technologies and to create an assessment complex which helps evaluate
   the preparedness of future teachers to work under risks in a
   multicultural environment. Moreover, we have developed an assessment
   complex tool which enables to assess if teachers are prepared to work in
   the context of increased migration. This tool helps establish the ethnic
   identity types of future teachers as well as evaluate their coping
   strategies. We have evaluated the increasing potential of simulation
   technologies and how they can be used for effective multicultural
   teacher education; we have established the criteria for teacher
   competences and preparedness to deal with risks; we have identified the
   conditions of the effective use of simulation technologies in the
   informational space of a university. In order to develop the noxological
   competence of future teachers we have developed an educational model
   which aims to develop the preparedness of teachers to deal with risks
   with the use of simulation technologies. The materials of this study
   represent practical value for the specialists working in the field of
   teacher education in a multicultural environment.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the presented research is conditioned by the necessity
   of continuous formation of a competitive personality. The
   competitiveness of the state in the world market is caused by the level
   of transport and energy infrastructure, the level of training and
   qualification of the country's engineers. These have determined the task
   currently being decided by educational organizations to find new
   resources for training of highly qualified specialists for the diverse
   industries to develop. Analyzing the multicomponent training of future
   engineers, experts note the pedagogical potential of mathematical
   disciplines in the formation of professional competence of engineers.
   The potential of the cyber-information approach in the training of
   engineers at university is disclosed and justified in the article, the
   potential is represented by a combination of the following resources:
   motivational-adaptive, subjective, integrative, managerial. The authors
   developed the author's method of training of future engineers in
   mathematics at university on the basis of the information-cybernetic
   approach, represented by successively implemented modules: ``I get to
   know myself.{''} ``Intellectual puzzle{''}, ``Entertaining modeling{''},
   ``Creative laboratory{''}. The effectiveness of the developed
   methodology was proved in the course of the experimental research
   carried out from 2012 to the present time and the experimental training
   in mathematics at university using the didactic potential of the
   information cybernetic approach. The materials of the article can be
   useful in practical terms for university teachers of mathematics
   striving to significantly improve the level of mathematical training of
   future engineers.},

Abstract = {The health and beauty of sports, the body and spirit, the perfect and
   unified cultural tradition has been an important source of the
   combination of beauty and beauty. Philosopher Plato first to claim the
   combination of aesthetic education and sports, that ``the movement of
   the body and the movement of sound has a common rhythm. Therefore,
   beautification of mind and physical fitness are internal consistent{''}.
   The harmonious development of the body and heart pursued by modern
   school sports is the highest embodiment of sports aesthetic education.
   The implementation of aesthetic education in college physical education
   is an important content to promote the individual development of college
   students and comprehensively implement the quality education training
   and innovation talents. Competitive sports can be divided into physical
   fitness and skills, is particularly pay attention to physical exercise,
   physical exercise and movement skills, personal competition, competitive
   or groups, which contains aesthetic thought and aesthetic value are very
   obvious, and about aesthetic education is often used with the athletic
   sports education. This paper focuses on the study of two kinds of sports
   with high aesthetic value. The results of the study showed that: from
   the physical quality, the cooperative spirit, the aesthetic ability and
   the innovation ability, the four sides faced the analysis of the
   aerobics, the aesthetic value weighted 45.3\%, and the sports value was
   39.0\%. It shows that the value of aesthetic education plays a
   significant role in sports such as aerobics and exercise.},

Abstract = {Despite its complexity in science, sinking and floating is a phenomenon
   about which students of almost all grades develop personal theories,
   using a variety of conceptual elements such as weight, volume, shape,
   and density, prior to classroom teaching. Here, we distribute students
   from elementary to high school according to the levels of their
   achievement on the learning progression regarding the buoyancy
   phenomenon. We suggest four levels of learning progression for buoyancy
   concept. We developed a 13-item, open-ended, and short essay type
   questionnaire to evaluate students' learning progression of buoyancy
   concept based on two different contexts. We evaluated the validity and
   reliability of the new instrument for measuring buoyancy learning
   progression using a series of rigorous statistical tests. Participants
   of this study were students in grades 3-12 (N = 1,017). A series of
   analyses including internal consistency analysis (Cronbach alpha),
   confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling, and
   Rasch analysis for item fit and person/item reliability revealed that
   the instrument met the quality benchmark. Furthermore, our findings
   revealed that students' abilities in two different contexts were
   differentiated. Finally, we discuss the four levels of learning
   progression, concept assessment items developed, and some implications
   based on the findings.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to take the opinions of teachers and
   principals to determine the ways to improve the quality of service in
   high schools in order to improve student satisfaction. This study tried
   to increase the awareness of teachers and principals about the quality
   in education and to provide their contribution to creating quality
   culture in high schools. In this study, a purposive sampling method was
   employed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 teachers
   lecturing at high schools and 10 school principals. The data was
   analysed through content analysis. The findings show that teachers
   emphasised the in-service training needs of teachers and school
   principals and principal duties of school guidance and counselling
   services, whereas school principals stressed the importance of usage by
   teachers of effective teaching methods; relations between students and
   principals, and relations between guidance and counselling services and
   teachers.},

   Blind Association assisted the teaching-learning and administrative
   processes for the visually impaired. Qualitative research techniques
   were used for data collection and analysis. This study is a case study
   that aims to examine how the technology used in the association
   facilitated the teaching-learning and administrative processes for the
   visually impaired people. The study also found that with the assistance
   of technology the participants of the study were quite motivated and
   could easily communicate with each other and also with people outside
   their organization. Yet, there is a lack of technological devices such
   as automatic high-speed book scanner and imported books printed in
   Braille that would improve the quality of life of the association
   members.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore the learning effects and attitudes of
   students in the course electric welding practice in a university of
   science and technology to which the push-pull technology-based mobile
   learning system is applied. In this study, the push-pull technology is
   adopted to establish a mobile learning system and develop the Push-pull
   Course of Special Topic Mobile Learning of Electric Welding, which
   includes three parts - (1) the instruction of the electric welding
   course, (2) the learning of the electric welding course, and (3) the
   multi-dimensional evaluation of the electric welding course. Two classes
   of the course in the department of engineering science of university of
   science and technology were taken as the research subjects for the
   experimental instruction, with 61 students in the Experimental Group and
   58 in the Control Group. Throughout the instruction, the questionnaire
   and written information about the students were collected and analyzed
   so as to explore the influence of ``Push-pull Mobile Learning Course of
   Electric Welding{''} on the academic performance and attitude. Here are
   the conclusions of this study: (1) the course can significantly improve
   the students' learning of electric welding; (2) students hold a positive
   attitude towards the course; (3) the course can facilitate the students'
   discussions, learning effects and cooperative learning. Also, this study
   gives some suggestions for the instruction of the course, so as to
   enhance students' knowledge and skills of electric welding and promote
   the significance of the course.},

Abstract = {In terms of functionality, today's mobile devices allow users to surf
   the Internet, monitor e-mail, watch and share videos and pictures,
   interact on social-networks and utilize a large array of software-driven
   applications. Much research concerns motivation and satisfaction in the
   school system, but there is little empirical evidence of how these
   factors affect older farmers. While mobile technologies and social media
   have changed the value and importance of human connections, it is
   necessary to understand the interaction between motivation and
   satisfaction with life for older famers. This study determines the
   relationships between motivation, the use of mobile devices and
   satisfaction with life for older farmers. Key factors are
   operationalized using scales that are widely used and tested. A survey
   is distributed to participators and a multiple regression is used to
   determine whether positive motivation for the use of the Internet and
   mobile devices predicts the scale for the satisfaction with life. This
   study contributes to related subjects by determining factors that could
   be optimized with a view to enhancing learning and satisfaction with
   life for old farmers.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of technology and economy has largely enhanced the
   quality of life. Nevertheless, various social and environmental problems
   have emerged. It would be the key solution to develop environmental
   education in order to have people present the environmental knowledge
   and the attitudes and value to concern about the environment and develop
   the skills and action to solve environmental problems. Environmental
   education teachers in 25 colleges and universities in central and
   southern Taiwan are researched in this study. Total 250 copies of
   questionnaires are distributed, and 224 valid copies are retrieved. The
   research results conclude the significant positive correlations
   1.between professional development and professional knowledge \&
   competence, 2.between teacher belief and professional knowledge \&
   competence, and 3.between teaching efficacy and professional knowledge
   \& competence. According to the research result, suggestions are
   eventually proposed in this study. It expects to arouse the public
   cognition of environment to care for the environment through curriculum
   instruction of environmental education teachers and have people present
   the environmental knowledge and the attitudes and value to concern about
   environment.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is to study and change the structure of a
   mathematical lesson to improve quality of pupils' mathematical training
   and design mechanisms of inclusion the systems of open type tasks in
   educational process considering specifics of pupils' creative
   personality development. The leading method is modeling of a
   mathematical creative lesson. The structure of it contains such stages,
   as motivation, psychological relief, intellectual warm-up and resume,
   besides traditional substantial sections. More than 700 pupils from 5-9
   grades of comprehensive school took part in the experiment, which has
   been carrying out for the last three years. The result of the research
   is the author's idea of using separate open type tasks, and the system
   of open type tasks, which consider psychological, physiological,
   motivational and cognitive features of pupils, promote development of
   their creative component for meta-subject results achievement. The
   practical use of the structure of a mathematical creative lesson and the
   systems of open type tasks shows pupils creative results and progress in
   mathematical training, expressed by best marks on the subject and at
   mathematical competitions of various levels. It proves the quality
   improvement of mathematical education among pupils trained by the
   offered technique.},

Abstract = {It is clearly understood that technology oriented education on special
   training is neither sound nor adequate when considered from the literary
   point of view in our country. Limited studies held in country not only
   support this point of view but also demonstrate the lack of resource and
   studies carried out in this area. During the designing and developing
   process one of the qualitative methods called the design base research
   but then completing the design and development process, a common
   academic way of evaluation the single subject research method have been
   implemented in order to test the forcibleness of the work in the respect
   of special training and education. The study carried out through nine
   special training tutors and ten mentally disabled students. The
   following as a pilot study, the efficiency process has been accomplished
   through three teachers and three students. The feedback forms used to
   get the remarks of the teachers and through the use of the content
   analysis method the data resolved, during the phase of evaluation of the
   software. In respect of the analyses carried out, the practice has been
   considered as rather effective and applicable and useful by the teachers
   attended this pilot case study. The process confirming the results of
   the case study carried out by the teachers, according to the afore
   stated study, the results have been successful and the targeted notions
   have also been learned, which made the students feel that all these
   practices worked! It could easily be said that the software developed is
   both useful and applicable, moreover, the trainings committed
   conveniently have rather been effective.},

Abstract = {The education of architectural design requires balanced curricular
   arrangements of respectively theoretical knowledge and practical skills
   to really help students build their knowledge structures, particularly
   helping them in solving the problems of cognitive load. The purpose of
   this study is to establish an architectural design knowledge conversion
   model, helping students to obtain architectural design knowledge through
   a learning process of knowledge sharing/socialization, extraction,
   externalization, integration, creation and internalization. This model
   can help students to effectively solve the problems of cognitive load in
   the learning process, achieve knowledge construction and storage through
   meaningful learning, apply their knowledge in their future designs and,
   ultimately, improve their design capability.
   This study starts with a literature review on theories of knowledge
   conversion and cognitive load to establish an architectural design
   knowledge conversion model complemented with especially designed
   curricular contents and activities. The model is applied in actual
   teaching to find out if the application of this model has a positive
   influence on the students in their learning of architectural design,
   solving the ill-defined problems in their learning and easing their
   cognitive load.},

Abstract = {In order to effectively use technology in teaching, teacher candidates
   need to develop technology related pedagogical content knowledge through
   being engaged in a process of discussion, modeling, practice, and
   reflection. Based on the examination of teacher candidates' lesson plan
   assignments, observations of their microteaching performance, and their
   reflective journals, our study found that Microteaching Lesson Study in
   methods courses provides teacher candidates a great opportunity to learn

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to examine the effects of problem-based
   learning which was established on differentiation of content at three
   levels of complexity in the processing of the content of Analytical
   geometry in the plane. In this context, an experimental research was
   conducted, on a sample of secondary school students (N = 165) in order
   to examine whether methodical approach designed on the principles of
   problem-based learning based on differentiation of content gives better
   effects in learning compared to the traditional mode. The results of the
   final measurement shown that the experimental group achieved better
   overall success than control group. The results suggest that the
   proposed methodical approach contributes to better student performance
   in teaching geometry and that the most significant progress is achieved
   in the group of students who are average in terms of success and with
   ones below the average.},

Abstract = {Large-scale studies, such as the Trends in International Mathematics and
   Science Study (TIMSS), provide data to understand cross-national
   differences and similarities. In this study, we aimed to identify
   factors predicting mathematics achievement of Turkish students by
   comparing to Australian students. First, construct equivalence and item
   bias were evaluated to check the comparability. Second, factors
   predicting mathematics achievement of Turkish and Australian students
   were identified. Then, propensity score matching on background variables
   was conducted to identify the remaining achievement differences. Results
   indicated that mathematics skills were free of construct bias in these
   groups. After removal of some biased items, we obtained an item bias
   free booklet. Additionally, students' self-confidence and educational
   resources at home were significant predictors of achievement. Propensity
   score analysis indicated that educational resources and to a somewhat
   lesser extent self-confidence were effective in explaining achievement
   differences between these two countries.},

Abstract = {Learning to solve more challenging mathematics problems using multiple
   strategies has been promoted by research and is a feature of numerous
   curricula. Yet teachers have been found to be reluctant to incorporate
   these tasks into their lessons predicting resistance from students. This
   study examined 87 senior secondary students' reactions to a challenging
   quadratics task as part of their teachers' participation in a
   design-based research project. It sought insights into students' own
   perspectives on challenge and multiple strategies in mathematics
   teaching and learning, with the intent of understanding more about the
   cognitive, affective, and motivational aspects of this teaching
   approach. In responding to open-ended prompts, the students reported
   diverse but generally positive reactions related to their interest in
   the task and its relevance for their learning. Two thirds reported that
   they liked learning strategies from peers, and two thirds liked learning
   multiple strategies from their teacher. Implications for considering
   secondary students' preferences for learning, engagement, and motivation
   in mathematics lessons are discussed.},

Abstract = {Technology change is a key factor in the change of lifestyles in the
   society in the 21st century. The rapid alternation of computers, the
   Internet, and smart phones has human beings live in the
   information-built environment. Information technology is also applied to
   measure the modernization of a nation. A lot of countries even list
   computer learning as a primary course in the compulsory education, as
   the one mastering the latest information in the information flood could
   dominate everything and present better competitiveness in the world.
   Such a trend reflects on the education, especially the informatized
   administrative environments and information integrated instruction in
   schools, because convenient network information enhances interpersonal
   interaction breaking through traditional restrictions of space and time.
   Aiming at the teachers of universities in Fujian Province, total 500
   copies of questionnaires are distributed, and 276 valid copies are
   collected, with the retrieval rate 55\%. The research results show
   significant correlations between 1. information literacy and lifelong
   learning, 2. lifelong learning and school effectiveness, and 3.
   information literacy and school effectiveness. This study could help
   educational sectors better understand the current situation and discover
   the encountered problems and challenges. Based on such situations,
   suggestions are provided for education sectors. In addition to the
   academic contribution, this study also presents the value for practical
   reference.},

Abstract = {This study examines the efficacy of three teaching methods, namely,
   passive supported image pedagogy, active supported image pedagogy, and
   traditional instruction, in increasing the reading motivation and
   comprehension of students. 116 fourth-grade students participated in the
   study and were evenly assigned, according to their pre-test performance,
   to one of three groups: ``Passive Supported Group{''} (PSG), ``Active
   Supported Group{''} (ASG), and ``Text-only Group{''} (TOG). The PSG was
   asked to read a text with images; the ASG was asked to read the text and
   reconstruct the main ideas through image selection; and the TOG was
   asked merely to read the text. After eight weeks of reading-training,
   the three groups were asked to complete post-tests. Following this,
   independent-samples t-test and paired-samples t-test were used to
   analyze the results. Based on the results, active supported image
   pedagogy was found to be the most effective method for improving the
   reading motivation and comprehension of students.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between
   constructivist learning environment and students' motivation to learn
   science by testing whether students' self-efficacy in learning science,
   intrinsically and extrinsically motivated science learning increase and
   students' anxiety about science assessment decreases when more
   opportunities for personal relevance, student negotiation, shared
   control, critical voice, and uncertainty for scientific knowledge is
   provided. Constructivist Learning Environment Survey and Science
   Motivation Questionnaire were administered to 243 elementary school
   students. The hypothesized model for students' motivation to learn
   science in their perceived learning environment was tested via LISREL.
   The results revealed that the students were negatively motivated to
   learn science in more constructivist learning environment. On the other
   hand, the findings indicated that the students were more motivated to
   learn science when they had more opportunities in relating science with
   the real world issues. Therefore, science educators should emphasize
   more on the connectedness of science at school to real life for
   motivating students to learn science.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of fifth-grade
   mathematics teachers' efficacy (MTE) on their students' mathematics
   self-efficacy (SMSE) and mathematical achievement (SMA) in classrooms.
   Two mathematics efficacy instruments were administered to 58 classes
   (i.e. 58 teachers and 1244 fifth-graders respectively) to gather data
   associated with SMA scores in school. Statistical analyses were applied
   to the obtained data. The findings revealed that MTE beliefs
   significantly influenced both SMSE and SMA. Additionally, SMSE had a
   mediative impact on the effect of MTE on SMA. Subsequent to a discussion
   of the findings, suggestions were proposed for further improvement of
   mathematics teachers' efficacy and, in turn, for enhancing
   fifth-graders' mathematics self-efficacy and mathematical achievement in
   the future.},

Abstract = {The current study deals with freshman students who study at the
   Department of Science at the Faculty of Education. The aim of the study
   was to investigate the effect of teaching electrochemistry concepts
   using Predict-Observe-Explain (POE) strategy. The study was
   quasi-experimental design using 20 students each in the experimental
   group (EG) and control group (CG). An Open-Ended Test (OET) and Multiple
   Choice Test (MCT) were used as pre- and post-test respectively. The POE
   was used to treat the experimental group, post test scores showed a
   statistically significant difference in performance by the EG, which had
   less misconception. The results of this study suggest that using The POE
   strategy is conceptual understanding.},

Abstract = {This study investigates approaches, strategies and models used by
   prospective primary school teachers in responding to real-world
   problems. The research was carried out with 82 participants. Data were
   collected through written-exam and semi-structured interviews; and they
   were analysed using content and discourse analysis methods. Most of the
   prospective teachers did not pay attention to the realities of the
   contexts in which the problems are situated. Most of them displayed
   non-realistic approaches excluding their real world knowledge and
   experiences from their solutions. Many participants tended to use rules
   and procedures in a straightforward way leading to failures at
   interpreting salient aspects of the problem situations. Majority of the
   participants lacked the ability to use appropriate strategies that could
   scaffold their realistic considerations. Some constructed models of the
   situations; nevertheless, many of them lacked the ability to use these
   instruments as a conceptual tool to identify key aspects of the problem
   contexts.},

Abstract = {This quantitative study reports the effects of gender and grade level on
   secondary students' attitude towards chemistry lessons. For this
   purpose, the Attitude towards Chemistry Lessons Scale (ATCLS) was
   administered to 446 secondary school students between 16-19 years old.
   The ATCLS consists of four different subscales: liking for chemistry
   theory lessons, liking for chemistry laboratory work, evaluative beliefs
   about school chemistry and behavioral tendencies to learn chemistry.
   Data obtained from the ATCLS survey was analyzed using two-way MANOVA to
   identify the effects of gender and grade level on students' attitude
   towards learning chemistry. The findings show that gender and grade
   level have a significant effect on attitude towards learning chemistry.
   Gender and grade level also have a significant interaction effect
   (Wilks' lambda = 0.933, F (15, 1198) = 2.032, p < 0.05) on secondary
   school students' attitudes towards chemistry.},

Abstract = {Pierre M. Van Hiele created five levels of geometric thinking. We
   decided to identify the level of geometric thinking in the students in
   Slovenia, aged 9 to 11 years. The majority of students (60.7 \%) are at
   the transition between the zero (visual) level and the first
   (descriptive) level of geometric thinking. Nearly a third (31.7\%) of
   students is at the first level whereas 4.3 \% of students are at the
   zero level. Only 1.4 \% of students reached the second level of
   geometric thinking. Students had the most difficulty with the use of
   appropriate geometric language, so a teaching approach to improve
   mathematical language was created, in an attempt to accelerate the
   transition to a higher level of geometric thinking. The teaching
   approach that proved successful was based on the use of different
   materials, concrete experiences, promoting the use of appropriate
   geometric language and motivation of students.},

Abstract = {Attitudes of the students towards mathematics lessons are very important
   in terms of their success and motivation. The purpose of this study is
   to develop a scale for the assessment of primary school students.
   attitudes towards mathematics courses in the 2nd and 3rd grades, to
   analyse its validity-reliability structure and to determine the
   students' attitudes towards mathematics. Emotional facial expressions
   are used in the scale because students can have reading and writing
   literacy difficulties in the 2nd and 3rd grades. The study group of this
   research consisted of 350 primary school students studying in the 2nd
   and 3rd grades of primary schools located in Northern Cyprus. The
   Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was 0.92. Factor
   analysis results suggested that the scale was gathered in one factor and
   total variance explained was 57.796\% for one factor. In general, it is

Abstract = {This study aims to discuss the effects of E-Learning and cooperative
   learning on learning outcomes. E-Learning covers the dimensions of
   Interpersonal communication, abundant resources, Dynamic instruction,
   and Learning community; and, cooperative learning contains three
   dimensions of Cooperative motive, Social interaction, and Cognition
   construction. Teachers and students in ten public and private
   universities in southern Taiwan are selected as the research subjects.
   Total 500 questionnaires are distributed and collected on-site, and 327
   valid copies are retrieved with the retrieval rate 65\%. The research
   finding show partially significant correlations between E-Learning and
   cooperative learning, between cooperative learning and learning
   outcomes, and between E-Learning and learning outcomes. Finally, several
   suggestions are proposed for teachers in E-Learning and cooperative
   learning.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we trace selected strands of the German path to Education
   for Sustainable Development (ESD). We start by addressing pre-ESD
   research, and move to the concept of Gestaltungskompetenz, the core
   concept of German ESD. The concept had to be realigned as to become more
   compatible with international research on learning outcomes
   (competencies). Compared to its beginnings, the meaning of
   Gestaltungskompetenz has much advanced, e. g., influenced by German
   competence research in science education, to which the Gottingen Model
   for socioscientific reasoning and decision making contributes. The paper
   presents a new competence dimension on ``Evaluating and reflecting
   solutions quantitatively-economically{''} for this model. The
   contribution highlights the integrative and interdisciplinary scope of
   the educational challenges posed by Sustainable Development.},

Abstract = {Particularly in the second half of the 20th century, historical
   approaches became relevant in science education. This development can at
   least in part be explained with the growing awareness of the importance
   to address Nature of Science aspects in science education. In comparison
   to the international publications, some particularities can be
   identified in Germany. Most notably, using historical approaches is
   mainly limited to the field of physics education, only few approaches
   can be found in chemistry and hardly any in biology education. Moreover,
   several approaches have been realized which use historical experiments
   in educational settings. This paper gives an overall analysis the
   historical approaches and their role in German science education as well
   as some insights into current approaches.},

Abstract = {The study investigated the common misconceptions of lower secondary
   school students regarding the concepts of photosynthesis and plant
   respiration. These are abstract concepts which are difficult to
   comprehend for adults let alone for lower secondary school students.
   Research of the students misconceptions are conducted worldwide. The
   researches show that many students do not even understand the
   fundamental concept that photosynthesis and plant respiration are
   related, mutually connected physiological functions. Many mistaked
   photosynthesis for plant respiration and that respiration took place
   only in leaves where are special organs such as pores. They also
   believed that the plant produced oxygen over the entire day and that the
   most important source of food for plants is water with dissolved mineral
   substances. The research showed that Czech students have many
   misconceptions about photosynthesis and plant respiration. In the study,
   we finaly go on to propose teachers that teachers could eliminate
   misconceptions by graphic explanation of these concepts, correct
   chemical clarification of photosynthesis and respiration, and connecting
   integration about this processes. The study sample size consisted of 108
   lower secondary school students (age 11 - 16 years) in the Czech
   Republic. The questions were designed in two parts: the first part was
   focused on the students knowledge, and the second part on the
   explanation of the answer. The data was analyzed in several ways first
   by the students' knowledge (correct/incorrect answers), then by their
   misconceptions (frequency of occurrence of misconceptions).},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in order to reveal the usage profiles and
   perceptions of Asynchronous Discussion Forums (ADFs) of 126 computer
   engineering students from the Computer Engineering Department in a
   university in Turkey. By using a mixed methods research design both
   quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed. Research
   findings indicated that the ADFs were frequently and effectively used by
   computer engineering students as a learning instrument. Another finding
   was that discussions in the ADFs were in the form of question-answer and
   resulted in important learning outcomes especially in eliminating the
   problems encountered by the students.},

Abstract = {This research has designed the ``Interactive Device - Food Island{''}
   with the intention of promoting the concept of food safety in an
   interactive way. In order to examine the value of interactive devices in
   the aspect of the reading experience and the purpose of reuse. This
   research will ask people to take the ``Interactive Device{''} survey to
   explore the reading experience. This research has obtained 192 valid
   questionnaires from the surveyors. The results of the analysis: (1) a
   good ``Interface design{''} could have positive influence on the
   ``Technology acceptance model{''}. (2) The explanation rate reaches
   41.7\% in the ``Reading experience{''} for the ``Interactive Device -
   Food Island{''}. ``Interface design{''}, ``Usability{''}, and
   ``Perceived enjoyment{''} could have a positive impact on the ``Reading
   experience{''}. (3) Compared with the ``Interface design{''}, the
   ``Usability{''}, and the ``Reading experience{''}, the factor of
   ``Perceived enjoyment{''} may be more effective in the ``Intention to
   reuse{''}, the explanation rate reaches 44.8\%. Thus, this research has
   concluded that the ``Interactive Device -Food Island{''} could improve
   the positive ``Reading experience{''} so to attract the user to use it
   again. The conclusion of this research can be a reference for food
   safety education in digital communication.},

Abstract = {Online teaching has become more and more popular in China, which has
   also become a widespread way of instructing in the field of mathematics,
   science, technology and other subjects. Based on the analysis of the
   characteristics of instructing, students and learning styles, a research
   on the influential factors of online teaching was conducted by methods
   of the integrated technology acceptance model and social cognitive
   theory from the cognitive point of view. Through questionnaire
   investigation, students were categorized according to different learning
   styles. Through the establishment of the structural equation that the
   significant influential factors of students with different learning
   styles on the effect of web-based teaching were identified. It was
   concluded that Utility Value possessed significant influence on online
   teaching for learners with whatever type of learning style. To people
   that provide online teaching service, individualized and customized
   teaching strategies can be established for students with different
   learning styles and cognitive characteristics. Meanwhile, the context
   further explored the online teaching strategies that were friendly and
   suitable to students with diverse learning styles.},

Abstract = {All elements within an organisation have a direct impact on the success
   and continuity of organisation. The relationship between the
   organisation administrator and employees has a significant importance.
   The elements that are significant about organisation are also relevant
   with the success of school. The communication level between the school
   administrator and teachers, behaviours of administrator and commitment
   of teacher towards his/her school are important regarding the continuity
   of school. The leadership features of school administrator have an
   impact on the success of teacher and students. The behaviours of school
   administrator that may create problems not only would deteriorate the
   success of teacher and students but also have an impact on the
   commitment towards their organisation. This study is ``a relational
   screening model{''} among the general screening model and is a
   descriptive study. The total number of 313 social, science and
   mathematics teachers working in public and private secondary schools
   (total 22 schools) were interviewed. SPSS 21 program was used for the
   quantitative data as well as the regression, frequency (f), percentage
   (\%) and statistics techniques.},

Abstract = {Since China's reform and opening up, although energy intensity of
   manufacturing industry has showed a trend of decline overly, compared
   with developed countries, it remains high. The research object of this
   paper is energy intensity of manufacturing industry, based on
   Wuli-Shili-Renli system methodology, it builds factors system of energy
   intensity of manufacturing industry. Based on time series data from 1980
   to 2014, it uses VAR model to explore influence law of various factors
   on manufacturing energy intensity. Impulse response analysis shows that
   in the short term, the whole society fixed asset investment structure,
   technological progress, economic development level and structure of
   property rights have a great influence on energy intensity. With the
   increase of technological progress rate, per capita GDP, proportion of
   state-owned enterprises, manufacturing energy intensity starts to
   reduce; with the increase of proportion of investment in fixed asset of
   energy intensive industries, manufacturing energy intensity starts to
   rise. In the long term, energy price, energy consumption structure, FDI
   and industry structure have a great influence on manufacturing energy
   intensity. With the increase of proportions of coal consumption and
   heavy industry, manufacturing energy intensity starts to rise; with the
   increase of energy price, manufacturing energy intensity starts to
   reduce. Variance decomposition shows that energy consumption structure,
   energy price and technological progress have a greater contribution to
   manufacturing energy intensity, optimizing energy consumption structure,
   controlling energy price and promoting technological progress are
   important approaches to reducing manufacturing energy intensity.},

Abstract = {The frequent one-to-one contact offers an ideal opportunity for
   paediatricians to perform oral health risk assessment and educate
   families on preventive oral health care at early stages. The aim of this
   research is to assess paediatricians' knowledge, attitude and practice
   regarding children's oral health. A cross-sectional survey was sent to
   all paediatricians currently practicing in the North Cyprus. Data was
   analysed using statistical package for social sciences for descriptive
   and univariate analysis. Response rate was 92\%. Almost all of the
   paediatricians stated that oral health advice should be included in
   their routine health supervision. However, many of them reported not
   feeling confident enough to take active role in preventive oral health
   care. Less than quarter of the total paediatricians reported that they
   had received oral health education previously. Previous oral health
   education/training was associated with improved oral health knowledge,
   confidence in entering oral health discussions with caregivers and
   identifying oral health pathologies. The results of our study support
   the need for paediatricians to receive further oral health
   training/education.},

   Students' Ideological and Moral Outlook},

Abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of network technology has brought
   new changes in the media, and pushes mankind into a new era of
   information. The network we media represented by the Internet is the
   product of current network technology and media, because of its high
   openness, freedom and tolerance, the network we media becomes the
   important strength impacting ideological and moral aspects of college
   students. On the one hand, the new media can enrich students'
   information resources, broaden their horizons, on the other hand, the
   information brought by new media is not always good, which impacts the
   students' moral outlook, and the traditional moral order is imbalanced.
   The moral anomie phenomenon of college students has aroused great
   concern of the society, under the background of new media, moral
   construction has become increasingly prominent. As the pillar of
   national future, college students' moral level is closely related to the
   development of social morality. In the network media environment, due to
   the immaturity of college students' moral, inappropriate moral education
   at school and the new media environment, the moral cognition and moral
   behavior are not aligned, and the moral subject is absent. The moral
   education at the virtual space is detached with the moral education from
   reality, and moral standards are diverse. Therefore, it is imperative to
   set up correct moral consciousness and cultivate good behavior habits.
   In this paper, the positive and negative aspects of the influence of we
   media on ideological and moral outlook of college are analyzed, and the
   college students' ideological and moral status in the network we media
   environment are analyzed. It is pointed out that in the process of
   shaping the moral outlook for students, school should be responsible for
   the ideological and moral cultivation, and make the network we media a
   healthy moral education platform, so as to promote students growth
   healthier.},

Abstract = {The concept of lifelong education has four indicators: school education,
   social education, formal education and non-formal education. Under the
   concept of lifelong education, the concept of ``higher education{''} can
   be summarized as four indicators, such as regular higher education,
   adult higher education, self-study higher education examination and
   distance network education. Foreign scholars consider that the concept
   of ``higher education{''} is aimed at adults, which has little relevance
   with the concept of lifelong education. In China, the influence of
   concept of lifelong education on the construction and development of
   ``higher education{''} is not proposed clearly. Based on the research
   status, SWT analysis method was introduced. The internal relation
   between the concept of lifelong education and the concept of higher
   education was analyzed through the four groups of corresponding
   relationship between internal advantage and external advantage. Through
   the detailed analysis of four groups of corresponding relationship such
   as the school education and regular higher education, the social
   education and adult higher education, the normal education and
   self-study higher education examination, the non-formal education and
   distance network education. The conclusion that the concept of lifelong
   education could promote the development and construction of concept of
   higher education in China was obtained. In the process of analyzing each
   component, the conclusion that the external variables also increased
   with the increase of internal variables could be obtained. Integrating
   the variation tendency of four components, the overall variation trend
   between concept of lifelong education and the concept of ``higher
   education{''} was obtained. Through this analysis, blanks in our
   academic research are filled. The concept of lifelong education has a
   strong role in promoting the development and construction of the concept
   of higher education. Through a detailed analysis, we will find a better
   way to develop higher education.},

Abstract = {Individuals with special needs have such rights as benefiting from
   health services and obtaining an education which is consistent with
   their abilities. As long as they can use these rights effectively like
   other individuals do, they are satisfied, active and productive in their
   social lives. Individuals with special needs who were ignored and
   neglected for centuries became socially accepted after social values
   began to change in a positive direction. This positive change was mostly
   felt in the field of education. The purpose of this study is to display
   the social acceptance level of students with special needs by normal
   peers in inclusive classes in TRNC (Turkish Republic of Northern
   Cyprus). According to the findings, female participant students show
   more positive social acceptance towards inclusive students compared to
   male students, and it was found out that social acceptance level does
   not show any difference based on age of the participants.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop a measurement tool for school
   administrators to use crisis management skills in terms of school
   development as pre-crisis (PC), crisis moment (CM) and post-crisis (PC).
   In the study, the steps of the process carried out for this purpose are
   explained. In the scale development process, firstly, scanning of the
   literature was carried out and similar scales were examined. Expert
   opinion has been consulted for the validity of the scale. The study
   group of the survey has 216 vocational high school teachers working in
   North Cyprus in the 2016-2017 school year. Factor analysis was performed
   to determine the validity of the scale. The results of the factor
   analysis revealed that the scale factor was a factor and that the total
   factor variance was 50,211\% for one factor. The reliability coefficient
   of the scale (Cronbach alpha) was found to be 0.95. The value of
   Kaiser-Meyer Olkin (KMO) was found to be 0.917. Therefore, this scale
   has led to the conclusion that school administrators can accurately and
   credibly measure crisis management skills in terms of school
   development.},

Title = {Validation of the UTAUT Model: Re-Considering Non-Linear Relationships

Abstract = {Over the years, The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology
   (UTAUT) has served many researchers in unravelling technology acceptance
   intentions. What has become a chasm in the literature has been the
   seeming exclusion of non-linear relationships of UTAUT exogeneous
   variables (Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence
   and Facilitating Conditions) in model formation and the overall
   determination of construct predictive relationships. Secondly, there is
   a dearth in technology acceptance research in distance-based higher
   education settings. In an attempt to bridge these gaps, this study
   adopted the UTAUT model and utilized the Partial Least Squares approach
   to evaluate a combined linear and non-linear relationships based UTAUT
   model. The survey design was employed in which a questionnaire was used
   to obtain data from a sample of 267 respondents (tutors) from a
   distance-based higher education milieu with a country-wide distribution.
   Results obtained indicated that non-linear relationships exist between
   exogeneous factors to better explain constructs' behaviour in the model.
   A new relationship between facilitating condition and social influence
   was also discovered. The study thus concluded that in technology
   acceptance research, there is the need to include non-linear
   relationships in the UTAUT model to augment the predictive effects and
   explanations of the constructs' relationships. It further recommended a
   comparative analysis between a proposed comprehensive UTAUT model with
   non-linear relationships and moderators to the original UTAUT model for
   further empirical analysis. This is to compare results in terms of
   coefficient of determination (R-2) and predictive relevance (Q(2)).},

Abstract = {Mass media television, radio and Internet have a profound influence and
   change people's way of thinking, values and behaviors, especially for
   new media heavy users of university students, the influence of the media
   is more obvious and profound. In order to play the guiding thought of
   Ideological and political education in the complex media environment, we
   must combine the theory and the practice of communication into the
   academic research and practice activities, broaden the ideological and
   political education discipline field, and improve the effectiveness of
   Ideological and political education. The network news communication has
   both positive and negative influences on the ideological and moral
   education of university students. Firstly, this paper analyzes the
   characteristics of network news communication, and points out that
   network news dissemination has selectivity and position. The
   characteristics of Internet news communication make it bring about two
   influences on the ideological and moral education of university
   students, that is, positive influence and negative influence. Finally,
   the author puts forward his own views on how to deal with the negative
   influence and how to deal with the negative influence of network news
   communication on the ideological and moral quality of university
   students.},

Abstract = {In 2016, with the widespread use of the somatosensory technology, the
   improvement of virtual reality and the head-mounted monitors, a lot of
   research and innovation emerged. The VR head-mounted monitors aren't
   used at fixed places. Learning by using the First Person perspective to
   execute the games, learners can escape the limit of monitors. Beginners
   will reduce the willingness to learn due to incorrect movements,
   operating the devices without coaches, and unable to observe oneself
   simultaneously. This study is based on experiential VR device, using
   Virtual coach and expanding mirror for auxiliary teaching and observing
   self-training process. Experimental observation method and questionnaire
   survey are applied to test. The test subjects are 53 boys and girls aged
   18 to 25 years old who haven't had contact with gym equipment. The study
   shows that 70 percent of the subjects hold a positive recognition
   towards the system operation and they can force on the correct position.
   The satisfaction is affected due to not being familiar with the way the
   game is operated for some learners. In the open questionnaire, learners
   mention that weight training materials provide them with the opportunity
   to view and correct their body movements and also raise learner's
   fitness will.},

Abstract = {When PPP (Public Private Partnership) mechanism is gradually accepted by
   domestic academic and bureaus of different levels, PPP is not only used
   in municipal infrastructures. To get closer with international trend,
   PPP is also applied at Public Schools. Due to the nature of common weal,
   Public Schools cannot refinance through service charge from delivering
   education activity. Therefore, governmental subsidy is necessary
   throughout the life circle of PPP public schools. Many factors have
   impact to the governmental subsidies, and service quality is the key
   among them. Focus on service defects and stakeholders' satisfaction, by
   means of theoretical and mathematic models, this paper will study the
   relationship between governmental subsidies and service quality.},

Abstract = {Environmental education has a substantial impact on the behavior and
   performance of mergers and acquisitions. Low-carbon M\&A is a new mode
   of mergers and acquisitions under the education of ecological
   civilization. This paper first analyses the improvement of ecological
   efficiency of low-carbon M\&A in different regions and industries in
   China, but there are significant differences in the improvement of
   environmental efficiency in different regions and industries. The higher
   efficiency industries are mainly distributed in the capital-intensive
   industries, followed by labor-intensive industries, while the resource
   intensive industries are the lowest. The cleaner production industries
   are significantly higher than the pollution intensive industries. The
   main reason is that there are significant industrial differences in
   environmental education, energy structure and low-carbon technology.
   Regional environmental efficiency is higher in the Yangtze River Delta,
   followed by the Pearl River Delta, the Circum-Bohai-Sea Region, the
   worst. The main reason is that there are regional differences in
   environmental education investment, resource endowment, government
   intervention, marketization level, environmental policy and ecological
   civilization education system. Increasing investment in environmental
   education is one of the key means of improving ecological performance.},

Abstract = {The key purpose of this paper is to offer an exploration of the
   metaphorical perceptions of preschool, elementary and secondary school
   children about science and mathematics. In this study, phenomenological
   research design is used which is among qualitative research designs. A
   total of eighty-two children were participated in the study. The
   information is sourced through a form containing statements like
   ``Science is like....., because.....{''} and ``Mathematics is like.....,
   because.....{''} and elementary and secondary school children were asked
   to fill in. After short conversations with preschool children about
   science and mathematics, they were asked ``What does science/mathematics
   look like and why?{''} and their responses were noted by the researcher.
   The outcome of the study demonstrates that the children in general have
   positive attitudes about science and mathematics. Findings also indicate
   that children's positive attitudes increase for science and decrease for
   mathematics with increasing age.},

Abstract = {This article provided a comprehensive review of the most recent
   mathematics curriculum reform in the early 21st century in China. Three
   components of curriculum reform were identified. The developmental
   process, the content and implementation of Chinese mathematics
   curriculum standards, constituted the most important second level of
   description of a curriculum reform which could reflect the first level
   (overall societal level) and decide the third level (classroom practice
   level). It could be the first fundamental step to provided helpful
   insight to understand the curriculum reform within a certain culture. At
   last, the future direction of mathematics curriculum reform in China was
   introduced.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between the
   demand for medical talents in China and the supply of talents in medical
   colleges and universities. Predicting the future development of medical
   talents is of great significance to the establishment of medical
   education and the cultivation of medical talents. Based on data from
   China Statistical Yearbook and OECD 34 countries from 2010 to 2014, as
   well as some research results on overseas and domestic scholars, a
   system dynamics prediction model relating the supply and demand of
   medical education talents is developed in this paper. Actual data for
   the Jiangsu Province is used to demonstrate the correctness, validity
   and applicability of the model. Simulation results show that, under the
   current conditions and political environment and to maintain the current
   average levels of OECD 34 countries, the projected number of demand for
   doctors in Jiangsu in 2024 is a little more than 319,800. Based on
   current data, there is still quite a large gap between these indexes in
   China and the desired target levels. Consequently, the system and
   structure of medical education need to be adjusted, with the
   corresponding policies and management system simultaneously reformed and
   medical environment improved.},

Abstract = {Typically, a teacher with more positive work values is more capable of
   handling the teaching jobs. He/she holds a more optimistic attitude
   toward the educational tasks and devotes more into teaching innovations.
   Similarly, during the non-formal learning process, a venue worker is
   analogous to a teacher for school education, his/her job involvement or
   job burnout conditions also affect the education within a venue. It is
   thus necessary to investigate the job involvement or job burnout
   conditions of venue workers. In order to inspect the influence
   vocational education and work values of venue workers on their job
   involvement and burnout conditions, 573 venue workers were selected in
   this study for the investigation by vocational education questionnaire,
   work values questionnaire, job involvement questionnaire, and job
   burnout questionnaire. The results are described as follows. 1.
   Vocational education have a significantly positive influence on job
   involvement. 2. Vocational education have a significantly positive
   influence on job burnout. 3. Work values have a significantly positive
   influence on job involvement. 4. Work values have a significantly
   positive influence on job burnout. Based on these results, we proposed
   recommendations accordingly so that the vocational education can bring
   its effects to the maximum degree and the off-campus studies for the
   public can be greatly enhanced.},

Abstract = {Information literate students with a good understanding of science are
   regarded as an important pool of future successful professionals. The
   study explored correlations between the information literacy (IL) and
   scientific literacy (SL) of university students and analysed their
   achievements according to Bloom's cognitive categories of remembering,
   understanding and applying knowledge. A theoretical connection between
   IL standards and SL competencies was exposed. An information literacy
   test and a science literacy test, derived from the PISA 2006 science
   scale, were used for assessment. The results showed a significant
   moderate positive correlation between students' SL and IL. Students with
   a better understanding of science were more successful in all three
   cognitive levels of IL, and students with higher SL scores were better
   in the application of IL knowledge. A specialised credit-bearing IL
   course with active learning significantly improved the IL level of all
   students, most notably in applying IL knowledge, and thus reduced the
   initial IL disparities between students with low and high SL. The study
   brought the realisation that the IL of university students depends on
   their SL obtained in previous education; however, a welldesigned
   university IL course contributes towards higher cognitive levels of IL
   for all students.},

Abstract = {Using the binocular stereo vision system, the branches of citrus trees
   in natural scene were reconstructed in virtual environment, to help
   citrus picking robots recognize and evade obstacles in real working
   scene. During the reconstruction, images were subjected to thinning,
   pruning, and curve fitting successively. We reduced the computational
   burden while guaranteeing the model precision. Then, we adopted the
   principle of modularized modeling and OpenGL for branch reconstruction.
   It is verified that the method developed in this work provides a route
   planning criterion and a virtual workplace for the robot's obstacle
   evading system.},

Abstract = {Applying education ideas and concepts to education sites, through good
   educational policies, to complete education tasks is important for
   developing personal potential. Centered on students, educational
   objective is to cultivate multiple talents for the future society. In
   such a rapidly changing era, limited knowledge is not enough to cope
   with challenge in future societies. In other words, the knowledge
   possessed presently could not solve the problems faced in the future.
   The nonequivalent pretest posttest control group design model is
   utilized in this study. Total 104 students in two classes in Chang Jung
   Christian University, Taiwan are experimented. The research results show
   (1) significant effects of exploratory education on creativity, (2) the
   optimal creativity promoted by exploratory education with virtual
   reality, (3) remarkable effects of exploratory education on leadership,
   and (4) the optimal leadership enhanced by exploratory education with
   virtual reality. Finally, suggestions are proposed according to the
   research results, expecting to educate students, with technology, to
   open the door of creativity and leadership.},

   provides guidance for teaching in the emerging cloud learning
   environment. This study designs the PIM based on the SCP and further
   applies it in the class teaching of a junior high school. A total of 94
   subjects from two classes were selected. One class was taught in SCP,
   and the other was taught in the traditional class. The pre-test shows
   both classes have little statistical significance in physics scores.
   After treating in the SCP for half a semester, the score of the
   treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group
   which means the use of the PIM proposed in this paper can improve
   students' academic performance. The PIM has promising outlook in
   improving deep collaboration, communication, and personalized learning.},

Abstract = {Interaction plays a significant role to foster usability and quality in
   online education. It is one of the quality standard to reveal the
   evidence of practice in online distance education models. This research
   study aims to evaluate levels of interaction in the practices of
   distance education centres. It is aimed to provide online distance
   education models through provided levels of interaction. Interaction and
   Satisfaction Survey was used in this study to collect quantitative data.
   This survey consists of personal information, student-student
   interaction, student-teacher interaction, student-content interaction,
   student-interface interaction and student satisfaction. In addition,
   interview was conducted to gather qualitative data. This research study
   is significant by highlighting the importance of student satisfaction in
   order to catch quality in the online distance education models. In this
   respect, this research study revealed that there is an intensified need
   to make aware learners, teachers and other parties on student-student

Title = {How Education Affects Mathematics Teachers' Knowledge: Unpacking
   Selected Aspects of Teacher Knowledge},

Abstract = {It is no surprise that all mathematics teacher education programs
   attempt to increase future teachers' knowledge, since teachers'
   knowledge has an effect not only on their teaching but also on their
   students' achievements. However, measuring the relationship between
   teachers' knowledge and their education is overly demanding. In this
   study we unpacked a selection of aspects of Mathematical Knowledge for
   Teaching (MKT) and created a 72-item survey that would measure teacher
   educators' and graduated teachers' perceptions of what graduated
   teachers have learned well or less well during teacher education. The
   data were collected under the auspices of the University of Eastern
   Finland. The results show that the teacher educators (N = 18) and
   graduated teachers (N = 101) who participated have developed rather
   similar perceptions of what graduated mathematics teachers learn well or
   poorly during their teacher education. According to the results, Subject
   matter knowledge and Pedagogical content knowledge receive similar
   emphases in the teacher education program, but certain fields of teacher
   knowledge, such as Common content knowledge, receive a greater emphasis
   than others. The approach described here provides a simple way of
   investigating this demanding phenomenon, and hence the limitations and
   the possibilities of the study will be discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop principal technology leadership
   competency indicators for technical high schools in K-12 in Taiwan in
   order to improve the effectiveness of school administration and
   teaching. In the first part of the study, five experts in the technology
   leadership field are interviewed to explore the technology leadership
   theorem model. In the second part of the study, eighteen experts in
   technology leadership and principals of technical high schools are
   recruited as subjects. Using the Delphi technique, questionnaires are
   constructed to assess competency indicators for principal technology
   leadership. In the third part of the study, the data from the
   questionnaire are analyzed using a KS-test and Kruskal-Wallis one-way
   analysis of variance by ranks. Finally, six dimensions and thirty
   competency indicators of the principal technology leadership of
   technical high schools in K-12 in Taiwan were established.},

Abstract = {Current mathematics education emphasizes techniques, formulas, and
   procedures, neglecting the importance of understanding, presentation,
   and reasoning. This turns students into passive listeners that are
   well-practiced only in using formulas that they do not understand. We
   therefore adopted the Polya problem-solving method to provide students
   with a diversified foundation for problem-solving. Furthermore, giving
   students immediate feedback in the form of prompts can help them to find
   the answers on their own them, thereby helping them learn more
   effectively. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the
   influences of a teaching activity incorporating Polya's method and an
   appropriate prompt mechanism on the learning effectiveness of students.
   Research Subjects were two classes selected from an elementary school in
   Taiwan; one as the experimental group were taught with the providing
   appropriate prompts based on the Polya strategy of mathematical problems
   solving, the other one as the control group were treated by the
   conventional instructions. The results showed that: (1) there were
   significant differences between the experimental group and the control
   group in the learning effectiveness; (2) most of the students in the
   experimental group were satisfied by the proposed prompts system.},

Abstract = {With the advent of the digital age, traditional didactic teaching and
   online learning have been modified and gradually replaced by ``Blended
   Learning.{''} The purpose of this study was to explore the influences of
   blended learning pedagogy on junior high school student learning
   achievement and the students' attitudes toward mathematics. To
   investigate the outcomes of the combination of Moodle online teaching
   platform and traditional instruction, a quasi-experiment was conducted
   using a pre-test-post-test control group design. ANCOVA and MANCOVA
   analyses showed that the blended learning experience benefitted students
   in the experimental group by having a positive effect not only on the
   learning outcomes, but also on their attitudes toward studying
   mathematics in a blended environment. Preliminary results indicated that
   male students and high-ability students were more motivated in the
   blended learning environment. Students gave positive feedback on the use
   of the Moodle learning platform for mathematics after experiencing
   blended learning.},

Abstract = {This experimental research study scrutinized the effectiveness of using
   augmented reality (AR) applications (apps) as a teaching and learning
   tool when instructing kindergarten children in the English alphabet in
   the State of Kuwait. The study compared two groups: (a) experimental,
   taught using AR apps, and (b) control, taught using traditional
   face-to-face methods. A total of 42 (i. e., 21 in the experimental group
   and 21 in the control group) preschoolers enrolled in the public
   educational system participated in this study in the second semester of
   the 2015-2016 academic year. The findings of this research are coherent
   and consistent with the results of other studies conducted over the past
   5 years as well as with the postulated hypotheses. The results revealed
   the following: (1) there were statistically significant differences
   between the control group (traditional group) and the experimental group
   (AR group) in their degrees of interaction with the English alphabet
   lesson in favor of the experimental group; (2) there were statistically
   significant differences between the control group and the experimental
   group in their scores on the English alphabet test in favor of the
   experimental group; and (3) there was a very strong linear
   relationship/correlation between the children's interaction with the
   English alphabet lesson and their scores on the English alphabet test in
   the AR group. The study concludes with relevant proposals and
   recommendations regarding the implementation of AR technology in
   education and suggests undertaking further studies on this interesting
   topic.},

Abstract = {In the era when digitalization is pursued, numbers are the major medium
   of information performance and statistics is the primary instrument to
   interpret and analyze numerical information. For this reason, the
   cultivation of fundamental statistical literacy should be a key in the
   learning area of mathematics at the stage of compulsory education. The
   emphasis on the expression and communication of charts, the
   understanding of preliminary concepts of sampling and probability, and
   the accurate application of statistical data to real life should be the
   blueprint of the thematic instruction. To effectively achieve the
   research objectives and test the research hypotheses, the nonequivalent
   pretest posttest control group design model is utilized for the
   experimental research. Total 208 students in Nanjing Auditing University
   are sampled for the 15-week experimental instruction, 3hr per week for
   total 45 hours. The research results are summarized as below. 1.
   Multiple memory strategies reveal significant effects on learning
   outcomes. 2. Multiple memory strategies appear remarkable effects on
   learning gains. 3. Computer-assisted instruction presents notable
   effects on learning outcomes. 4. Computer-assisted instruction shows
   significant effects on learning gains. 5. Matching multiple memory
   strategies with computer-assisted instruction could remarkably promote
   learning outcomes. 6. Matching multiple memory strategies with
   computer-assisted instruction could notably enhance learning gains.
   According to the analyses, suggestions are proposed to help the
   statistics instruction in mathematics and promote students `statistics
   learning achievement.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the internal conditions of students' concept
   learning and builds a learning cycle' based on the ``phases of the
   Moon{''} (MP) to, deepen students' understanding. The learning cycle of
   MP developed in this study includes three basic learning links, which
   are: cognitive conflict, abstraction and generalization, and transfer
   practices. The three basic learning links are named CAT for short. A
   teaching courseware based on CAT for MP is developed and tested in real
   classes. 667 students and 21 science teachers use this courseware in 9
   primary schools in Beijing. Three approaches for collecting data are
   incorporated, including: questionnaire surveys for students, interviews
   for students and teachers, as well as classroom observations by
   teachers. Findings indicate that CAT for MP is useful to engage
   students' thinking and deepen students' understanding of MP. Findings
   also suggest that CAT classroom instruction should be learner-centered
   and inquiry-oriented; teachers should use the ``nondirective
   language{''} to guide and boost students' learning. Accordingly, the
   learning cycle is worth further promoting towards being applied in
   students' concept learning. Moreover, the mechanism and application
   strategies of CAT need to be further studied and generalized, the
   students' learning achievements need to be deeply assessed, so as to
   make CAT more useful for science classes and learners.},

Abstract = {Preservice teachers (N=27) in two sections of a sequenced,
   methodological and process integrated mathematics/science course solved
   a levers problem with three similar learning processes and a
   problem-solving approach, and identified a problem-solving approach
   through one different learning process. Similar learning processes used
   included: conjecture and test, reason, and experiment and collect data.
   Although the problem was solved by similar processes: 26 out of the 27
   preservice teachers categorized the problem as one of mathematics
   because of its association with formulas, equations, and numbers. This
   learning process, which is not shared with science, signals a difference
   in the disciplines. This difference may be associated with sequenced
   integration, a form of integration which allows problem-solving in depth
   and enriches an understanding of epistemology. The implication for this
   study is that the current movement towards total, enhanced, and parallel
   integration may not allow students to strongly enrich aspects of
   mathematics learning.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate beliefs and perceived
   self-efficacy beliefs of Turkish prospective elementary mathematics
   teachers in using origami in mathematics education. Furthermore, gender
   differences in their beliefs and perceived self-efficacy beliefs were
   investigated. Data for the current study was collected via Origami in
   Mathematics Education Belief Scale (OMEBS) and Origami in Mathematics
   Education Self-Efficacy Scale (OMESS). Descriptive analysis results
   indicated that prospective mathematics teachers strongly believe that
   origami is beneficial and effective to be used in mathematics education.
   However, their perceived self-efficacy beliefs were at little higher
   than moderate level. Lastly, independent sample t-test results revealed
   that female teacher candidates have significantly higher beliefs and
   perceived self-efficacy beliefs in using origami in mathematics
   education when compared with male teacher candidates.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate how the 5E learning model
   affects learning about the Solar System when an analogical model is
   utilized in teaching. The data were gathered in an urban middle school
   7th grade science course while teaching relevant astronomy topics. The
   analogical model developed by the researchers was administered to 20
   seventh grade students in a city of the Black Sea Region in Turkey.
   ``The Solar System and Beyond: The space puzzle{''} unit was taught by
   using 5E learning model accompanied by analogical model during two class
   hours. In this case study, pre-experimental design with
   pre-test-post-test was used to collect data through questionnaire,
   reflective thinking scale, video recording, and informal observations.
   According to the findings of this study, the teaching intervention not
   only significantly increased the students' academic achievement but also
   improved their science process skills. The study suggests that analogies
   should be well-planned and deployed for teaching science courses.
   Furthermore, the number of the analogical models in textbooks should be
   increased to enrich meaningful learning for students' transition levels
   between concrete and abstract operational terms.},

Abstract = {This study aims at analyzing how Pythagoras' theorem is handled in three
   versions of Taiwanese textbooks using a conceptual framework of a
   constructive-empirical perspective on abstraction, which comprises three
   key attributes: the generality of the object, the connectivity of the
   subject and the functionality of diagrams as the focused semiotic tool.
   The results show that Taiwanese textbooks intended to develop the object
   through the variation among the levels of generality as well as between
   more and less familiar connections. The procedural diagrams were less
   provided than the conceptual diagrams, and the diagrams required more
   processing were less provided than the diagrams required less
   processing. Nonetheless, there were differences among the three
   textbooks. On the basis of similarities and differences, we discuss
   issues related to the learning and teaching of mathematics.},

Abstract = {As Chinese air pollution and other environmental problems were paid much
   attention by the public, appeals about reducing private car use and
   adopting public transport had come into being. In view of this context,
   the current study extended the theory of planned behavior by including
   environmental concerns to explore the effect of subjective factors on
   consumers' green commuting. A questionnaire study was conducted among
   commuters living in Beijing and Shanghai to collect data. By using
   structural equation modeling, the research confirmed that green
   commuting was mostly predicted by the factor of intentions. The article
   closed with discussion of theoretical and practical implications.},

Abstract = {Previous research indicates that lesson study can support preservice
   teachers' abilities to professionally notice. This qualitative case
   study examined specific lexical and indexical conversational components
   of lesson study analysis meetings that afford or constrain elementary
   preservice teachers' incidences of professionally noticing students'
   mathematical thinking. Results indicate that the facilitator supported
   preservice teachers to identify and provide evidence of student thinking
   through direct questioning and probing, allowing free discussion,
   modeling connections of student thinking to mathematics learning theory,
   and gesturing to explain mathematical concepts. Professional noticing
   was constrained by discussion of pedagogical procedures and longer talk
   segments by the facilitator or classroom teacher. Findings suggest that
   lexical and indexical inclusions in lesson study analysis meetings can
   support varied levels of preservice teachers' professional noticing. As
   demonstrated by the facilitator in our study, we recommend facilitators
   pay close attention to the prompts they pose and how they guide and
   model analysis of student thinking.},

Abstract = {To investigate the relationship between context and concept we have
   constructed a conceptual learning path in which students reinvent the
   concept of energy conservation and embedded this path in two authentic
   practices. A comparison of the expected learning outcome with actual
   student output for the most important steps in the learning path gives
   us a detailed insight in how the teaching-learning sequence functions.
   The analysis identified several characteristics of authentic practices
   that enhance the learning process and showed that every step in this
   innovative approach is possible for students to take. In addition to
   learning the concept of energy conservation, embedding the learning
   process in authentic practices gives rise to a development of students.

Abstract = {Here the paper provides a historical and philosophical analysis of the
   development of electromagnetic theory in physics teaching for the
   benefit of scientific literacy. The analysis is described by the
   paradigms offered by Kuhn. A number of scientists' work in
   electromagnetic theory which is embedded in the tension between engaging
   in revolutionary science and normal science provides an insight into how
   scientific work is thought to proceed. The work of revolutionary
   scientists: Faraday and Maxwell, who were pivotal in developing the
   understanding of electromagnetic radiation. A group of scientists now
   known as the Maxwellians were integral to refining and clarifying
   Maxwell's theory. By realizing these things, the students will become
   inspired and reinforced in resolve to understand the richness of
   scientific discovery.},

Abstract = {The epistemological beliefs of pre-service teachers influence both their
   teaching experiences and their students' content understanding. Little
   research has been devoted to the interaction between teachers'
   epistemological beliefs and teaching practices (Schraw \& Olafson,
   2002). To address this gap, this study investigated primary pre-service
   teachers' epistemological beliefs and their teaching and learning
   experiences, as well as how these relate to one another. The
   participants were 22 (13 females, 9 males) volunteer primary pre-service
   teachers. Data were collected from science learning histories,
   open-ended questionnaire on epistemological beliefs, classroom
   observation reports, lesson plans, and reflective diaries. The result
   showed that epistemological beliefs can be promoted by using teaching
   methods that focus on such beliefs.},

Abstract = {We explored adaptations to an elementary science methods course to
   determine how varied contexts could improve elementary preservice
   teachers' conceptions of NOS as well as their ideas for teaching NOS to
   elementary students. The contexts were (a) NOS Theme in which the course
   focused on the teaching of science through the consistent teaching and
   learning about NOS in all course activities, (b) Reflective NOS Teaching
   in which the course focused on developing explicit and reflective
   practice regarding NOS during portions of the semester, (c)
   Problem-Based Learning context in which local problem-based science
   scenarios were used to teach about NOS in an explicit and reflective
   manner, and (d) NOS embedded into Authentic Inquiry in which the
   learning and teaching of NOS occurred in conjunction with completing a
   long term science investigation suitable for use in elementary
   classrooms. We found that all preservice teachers improved in their
   conceptions of NOS in all four contexts, but to varying degrees.
   Preservice teachers described different strategies for teaching NOS by
   context. Our results show many contexts can be used to improve
   conceptions about NOS and the teaching of NOS, but certain contexts may
   support the learning of particular NOS ideas and the teaching of those
   ideas better than others.},

Abstract = {In spite of the commendations for the use of portfolio assessment, there
   is still little evidence indicating that such assessment actually
   supports and encourages student learning. Hence, this research study
   aimed to empirically identify the effects of implementation of portfolio
   assessment on student learning and attitudes. True-experimental design
   was used for the study. Participants of the research were nine-grade
   students. Portfolio assessment was implemented in the experimental group
   for eight-week duration in the physics course. Findings illustrate that
   the students assessed by the portfolio constructed more knowledge than
   the students that did not prepare a portfolio. On the other hand,
   portfolio assessment did not make any difference in the students'
   attitudes towards physics. This study concludes that portfolios are not
   only an indication for student growth but also a learning tool.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate inscriptions used in, Types
   of chemical reactions. topic in Turkish, Indian, and American chemistry
   textbooks. We investigated both the types of inscriptions and how they
   were used in textbooks to support learning. A conceptual analysis method
   was employed to determine how those textbooks use inscriptions to
   present, Types of chemical reactions.. Results revealed that textbooks
   disproportionately used inscriptions at symbolic level and failed to
   present submicroscopic level. Moreover, in Turkish and Indian books,
   explicit connections between all three levels of inscriptions were
   inadequate whereas American textbook had them sufficiently. Inscriptions
   including multiple levels were provided simultaneously in American
   textbook. This research will contribute to growing literature of
   international studies about use of inscriptions in science textbooks.},

Abstract = {Socio-scientific issue-based science education has been suggested for
   promoting general educational skills development in science classes.
   However, there is a lack of operationalized criteria, which can be used
   to reflect upon societal issues to whether turning them into issues for
   science classroom instruction. This paper describes a case study based
   on Participatory Action Research in science education. A lesson plan
   based on the socio-scientific issue of doping in professional sports and
   in fitness studios was designed and cyclically refined by a group of
   teachers and science education researchers. Along this case, together
   with previous studies of SSI-oriented curriculum development, the action
   research group started reflecting on the question of operational
   criteria for reflecting and carrying out socio-scientific issues in
   science classroom situations. This paper discusses the structure of the
   above-mentioned lesson plan. Experience gained during lesson plan
   development and testing will be reported upon. Suggestions stemming from
   teacher group discussions about the criteria chosen for reflecting
   socio-scientific issues for classroom use will also be presented.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to reveal whether there were differences in
   the understanding of scientific models according to their conceptions of
   lunar phases. The participants were 252 10th grader in South Korea. They
   were asked to respond SUMS (Students Understanding of Models in Science)
   instrument and to draw and explain why the different lunar phases occur.
   Students' conceptions of lunar phases were analyzed qualitatively based
   on established criterions and the differences in the perception of
   scientific models, a one-way ANOVA was conducted. Results indicated that
   Korean students' conceptions of the lunar phases were classified into
   five types: scientific, alternative, incomplete, eclipse explanation,
   and naive conception. The participants appeared to have different
   epistemological perceptions concerning each of the five sub-factors in
   the scientific models. The students with a scientific conception of
   lunar phases tended to understand that multiple representations could be
   used to express the different dimensions of an object. It was found that
   Korean students have a good understanding of the role of models as
   explanatory tools(ET) and the changing nature of scientific models(CNM).
   There was statistically significant differences were shown in ET,
   USM(uses of scientific models) and CNM factors depending on the types of
   conceptions of the lunar phases.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a critical review of the changes to the role of
   practical work in the science curriculum in England over the last forty
   years. The science curriculum over this period appears to place an
   emphasis on an approach to practical enquiry that suggests school
   students can act like `real' scientists. This paper provides a critical
   perspective of this view as it traces the developments of practical work
   and draws on the literature and on empirical work about how practical
   science in the secondary school (ages 11 to 18 years) has been enacted
   over this time period and gives some suggestions about the current
   situation and how practical work might develop in the future.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore possible developmental changes
   of vocational high school students' scientific inquiry competence while
   they learned within the ``Mechatronics{''} inquiry-based curriculum and
   instruction. A case study approach was employed in this study, while
   multiple resources of 77 11th graders' learning were collected and
   analyzed by using the editing analytic techniques. During the process of
   this two-year study, there were 11 changes of students' competence
   extracted from the data collected. These changes were inducted into 6
   categories of scientific inquiry competences and then finally formed
   three themes, ``basic competence, advanced competence, and critical
   competence{''}. The result of this study was reported as a developmental
   triad of students' scientific inquiry competences. Based on discussions,
   as teachers, we have to actively implement the real-life problem-solving
   teaching practice to enhance students' scientific inquiry competences.
   The findings of this study also provided the insight that how teachers
   understood the scope and sequence in designing inquiry-based curricula.
   Finally, the dialogue between the findings and the literature reminded
   us that students' scientific inquiry competences could not be cultivated
   in a short time; instead, a long-term and context-driven curriculum
   design is the cornerstone to develop their competences for future
   learning and life.},

Abstract = {Students' attitude towards mathematics is affected by factors such as
   parental influences, teacher affective support and classroom
   instruction. The purpose of this research was to examine the
   inter-relationships between these factors and effects on attitude
   towards mathematics using a partial least squares-structural equation
   modeling approach. A survey was carried out with a sample of 318 Form
   Four students from Sabah, Malaysia. The questionnaire consists of four
   scales: Perceived Parental Influences, Teacher Affective Support,
   Classroom Instruction and Attitude towards Mathematics. IBM SPSS 19.0
   and Smart PLS 2.0 were used to analyze the measurement and structural
   models. The results showed that with the exclusion of some indicators
   from the scales, the measurement models showed acceptable reliability
   and validity. The structural model has moderate predictive relevance but
   the inter-relationships of the constructs in the structural model were
   significant. Teacher affective support and classroom instruction predict
   attitude towards mathematics more than parental influences.},

Abstract = {This research cross-employed the Factor Analysis (FA) approach and the
   Entropy Compared Analysis (ECA) model of quantitative analysis and the
   fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) method of qualitative
   analysis to creatively pioneer the most effective and efficient
   Comprehensive Online Education Competitive Evaluation Model (COECEM).
   This was done in order to conduce the most Valuable Online Education
   Determinants (VOED) for exploring the most decisive online education
   determinants of sustainable strategy in the New Southbound Policy
   introduced in Taiwan. The most valuable findings are that
   ``Keyword-search Engine (KE) and Web 3.0 (W3) of core factors of Social
   Media Technology (SMT){''} and ``feedback technology function (FTF) and
   Course Complete Rate (CCR) of critical factors of Massive Open Online
   Course (MOOCs){''} directly and inductively influence ``Teaching
   Resource Distribution Administrative Consensus (TRDAC) of Resource
   Satisfaction Competency (RSC){''}. The reason is that feedback
   technology function and course completion rate with keyword-search
   engine and Web 3.0 in online education technological supporting in
   taking online education courses are the most considered key factors
   during corporate employees selecting online education MOOCs for higher
   education institutes sustainable operation in support of the New
   Southbound Policy.},

Abstract = {A meta-analysis of findings from 50 independent studies of peer tutoring
   programs in Mathematics at multiple educational stages showed that 88\%
   of these programs have positive effects on the academic performance of
   the participants (Hedge's g = 0.333). Some of the variables to be taken
   into account when developing a peer tutoring experience were analyzed.
   Results showed that variables such as the ages of the participants,
   roles, skills of the tutees (disabled or at academic risk vs
   non-disabled and not at academic risk), length of the sessions and
   frequency were not significant moderators of the academic achievement.
   Variables such as educational stage, design of the study, duration of
   the program, level of knowledge of the tutors, time of the day (school
   time vs out of school time) and sample size turned out to be significant
   moderators. Results are discussed and proposals for future research are
   suggested.},

   belief, 4 knowledge, 4 practice, and 3 attitude items. The sample size
   of the study was 218 participants. Structural equation modeling (SEM)
   was used to analyze research data. The results of the study revealed
   that after deleting 3 items of attitude, a 3-factor model was validated
   and well fit the research data. Therefore, the model best fits the
   Mongolian context in comparison to other models.},

Abstract = {This study, which was conducted to identify the views of students
   regarding the communication behaviours of instructors with the role of
   education administrators, aims to reflect the communication behaviours
   of instructors in the classroom management and the students' behaviours
   in the communication styles within the class environment. Therefore, the
   communication behaviours of instructors in classroom management were
   identified and then, it was asserted whether such behaviours vary based
   on the several independent variables, and finally the demographic
   characteristics of the students taking part in the scale were assessed.
   Based on the data obtained from such results, the views of instructors
   on the communication behaviours in the classroom management and their
   consideration for the lesson were obtained. The inventory of Samsa
   (2005) ``Measuring Communication Behaviors of Instructors{''} used in
   the quantitative research was adapted and 5 different dependent
   variables were obtained. 1. Form of Address, 2. Lecturing, 3. Use of
   Grammar, 4. Respect to the environment, 5. Clarity of
   communicationarethe sub dimensions of the scale. In this context, data
   was collected through a questionnaire, and the statistical analysis of
   data was conducted through Statistical Package Program.},

Abstract = {In this changing world, peoples are often challenged with problems that
   require the use of scientific information so that they are able to make
   informed decisions. However, the study of physics is entangled with many
   problems including the belief that it is a male domain and the way it is
   presented to students. The purpose of this study therefore, was to
   explore the role of Problem Based Learning (PBL) by applying five step
   problem solving strategy in enhancing conceptual understanding of female
   students. The study was conducted in Bonga College of teacher education,
   Ethiopia. To achieve the goal of the study, pedagogical experiment was
   applied. Data were collected using conceptual understanding inventory
   test and questionnaire. There was a mean difference between comparison
   and experimental groups. The difference was statistically significant
   with large effect size. Students in the experimental group shows good
   motivation towards the strategy. Based on the findings, it was suggested
   to apply the five step problem solving strategy at college and tertiary
   level. Because, this strategy was helpful for students to scrutinize the
   connection between theory and practice, improves their motivation to
   learn, and eradicates rote memorization. It also helps to understand
   concepts and principles central to physics.},

Abstract = {Using digital and internet technologies in recent years has not only
   provided more education opportunities outside classrooms, but has also
   gained many attentions as a new theme for prospective learners to
   acquire knowledge in a more convenient way. In such a new paradigm of
   the so called e-Learning, many efforts have been made to build web-based
   learning systems that provide controllable processes of learning
   activities with desired curricular contents. From the learning
   perspective, this means that desired contents are delivered with
   spectacular ways to catch the attention of the learners or to enhance
   their comprehension on these contents. For this need, we present in this
   paper a flip blended learning approach for designing, lecturing, and
   assessing academic courses with ePUB3 eBooks used in learning activities
   for delivering desired curricular contents. Further, for justifying its
   validity, the approach employs also an analysis about the effects of
   using our ePUB3 eBook-based flip blended learning model in academic
   course learning. For implementation, the approach is applied for the
   design and instruction of an `Object-Oriented Concepts' course for
   freshman students at a Department of Information Management.},

Abstract = {In this paper, taking the education quality of rural preschool education
   institutions in Cang County of Hebei Province as the research object,
   and 20 kindergartens of different educational levels and certification
   standards in Cang County of Hebei Province as the research samples, five
   evaluation indexes-teacher-student interaction, curriculum, physical
   environment, health and safety, and nutrition and diet were constructed
   according to the evaluation standard of the National Association for the
   Education of Young Children (NAEYC). A multivariate linear regression
   analysis evaluation model was built to evaluate the education quality of
   rural preschool education institutions in Cang County of Hebei Province
   according to the survey data. Through the data analysis, the problems of
   interscholastic unbalance of educational resource distribution and
   education quality, low literacy of teachers, unreasonable curriculum and
   unqualified private kindergarten in rural preschool education
   institutions in Cang County of Hebei Province were found, and the
   solutions of strengthening education resources, improving teacher
   qualification and teacher training systems, improving the treatment of
   teachers and strengthening quality supervision were put forward.},

Abstract = {Because of the diversity of network openness and network culture, health
   culture and decadent Western culture shock has a great impact on the
   value orientation, political attitude, personality, psychology and
   interpersonal aspects of college students, but also brings challenges to
   the content, mode and dominant of ideological and political education.
   This paper uses mathematical model to study the trend of ideological and
   political education in Colleges and universities in the information age.
   Firstly, the positive and negative influences of the network media
   environment on ideological and political education in Colleges and
   universities are analyzed, and specific countermeasures are given
   according to the negative influence, including: to increase the
   construction of the ideological and political education platform in
   campus network media and enhance the role the network media development
   in the work of ideological and political education in Colleges and
   universities; to construct the main line for the effectiveness
   development of College ideological and political education based on the
   network media platform; to give full play to the positive guiding role
   of the network media to the ideological and political education of
   college students, and make the network media maximize their advantages
   and promote the effectiveness of ideological and political education.},

Abstract = {The issue of educational evaluation has long been a research hotspot.
   Using big data analysis method to conduct educational evaluation can
   improve the pertinence and effectiveness of education. Conventional
   Apriori algorithm has certain limitations in the application of
   educational evaluation. This paper introduces an improved Apriori-Gen
   algorithm and describes its application in evaluation of actual
   effectiveness of ideological and political course of colleges and
   universities. Through conducting correlation analysis of network
   questionnaire data, the study requirements of college students can be
   acquired, so as to improve the teaching effectiveness of ideological and
   political course. Results show that it is effective to apply the
   proposed study method in educational evaluation.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzed the development of higher education and the regional
   differences in China, using the survey data and official statistics. Two
   indicators, the undergraduate students of per 100,000 population and
   higher education's contribution to GDP growth, were applied respectively
   to study the regional differences. The results showed that higher
   education in China was enjoying great development, fundamentally
   constructed talent cultivation system and comprehensively reasonable
   resource distribution. However, some colleges and universities still had
   some problems, such as incorrect orientation, overheated scale expansion
   and insufficient capital investment. Besides, higher education in China
   was suffering from considerable regional differences, namely higher
   education in East China is developing rapidly and contributing more to
   the economic growth, while the West China has presented slower rate of
   higher education development and smaller contribution to economic
   growth. Based on the problems lying in present reality of higher
   education development, this paper proposed the suggestions to enhance
   the development of higher education in China and to dispel the regional
   differences in higher education performance.},

Abstract = {This paper proposed a training system in the educational model of
   feasibility study studio considering feedback mechanism based on the
   learning process and knowledge bank. System dynamic theory was used to
   analyze information feedback between undergraduates and teachers as well
   as among undergraduates. Positive feedback stimulates and negative
   feedback inhibits practical ability improvement in the studio
   educational model. An initial function with dynamic features was
   established according to the feedback mechanism, the function's
   differential equation was solved to get the general solution. An ``S{''}
   curve demonstrates the trend of practical ability training performance
   in educational model of feasibility study studio. The formation process
   of the ``S{''} curve was explained. At last, some methods running the
   studio were proposed to elongate positive feedback and improve practical
   ability training performance in the educational model. This paper
   established the ability training pattern educational model of
   feasibility study studio and realized the integration of modules and
   platforms with theoretical knowledge as the inputs and practical
   abilities as the outputs.},

   learning styles, based on these two types of platform to start learning
   respectively. Using data analysis methods to explore the key factors
   that affect learning effectiveness. The results are that: 1. MOOC and
   SPOC are not alternative, but parallel. MOOC is fit for non-campus,
   large-scale education resource sharing, with education fairness as the
   concept. And SPOC is a special education mode on campus. 2. MOOC well
   adapts for basic theory education, while SPOC applies to professional
   skills education. 3. MOOC is more suitable for people with self-learning
   ability, and SPOC is suitable for students with weak ability to control
   themselves.},

Abstract = {This research is an integrated study conducted to identify the effects
   and experiences of the senior simulation applied to nursing students on
   those students' attitudes toward seniors. The effects were verified
   after conducting the senior simulation with 70 nursing students from
   March 1 to June 30, 2015. As the result of this study, the attitudes
   were researched and analyzed; they turned more negative after the
   simulation than before the simulation, but they turned significantly
   positive after the sharing of thoughts with others, so that the
   simulation had the final effect of enhancing attitudes. Qualitative
   measurements showed the enhancement of participants' understanding of
   seniors, a regret of past actions, and a consideration for their own
   later years, along with the will of the nursing students in their future
   nursing, as they mentioned that this experience had been positive. The
   senior simulation is an effective mediation of an empathic understanding
   of students toward seniors, and the simulation should be utilized in
   nursing education. Also, through the development of various forms of
   education programs to include senior simulation programs, and by
   securing enough simulation time for their operation, methods to heighten
   the educational effect of these programs need to be pursued. This study
   suggests implications and recommendations related to the development and
   application of future senior simulation programs.},

Abstract = {To clarify the utility of colleges and universities to help the
   development of sports industry, and to evaluate the degree of utility in
   promoting the sports industry in colleges and universities, is the
   effective way to further promote the development of sports industry in
   colleges and universities. Many kinds of methods and theories are used
   to evaluate the function of the development of sports industry in
   colleges and universities, for instance: WSR methods and theories; the
   function evaluation index which is constructed with the experts' advice;
   the Analytic Hierarchy Process which can be used to assign a weigh to
   each index; and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method(FCE). The main
   conclusions are as follows: This method can solve the problem of weight
   distribution, which can help to find out the leading factors in
   promoting the development of sports industry; Through the empirical
   analysis, it is helpful to solve the ambiguity and uncertainty of the
   evaluation process, and realize the objective evaluation of the

Abstract = {This empirical study attempted to investigate the effect of using online
   communities of practice in teacher education on pre-service teachers'
   critical thinking dispositions. California Critical Thinking Disposition
   Inventory and the comments posted to the online community of practice
   were used as the data collection tools. Results showed that online
   communities of practice did not affect pre-service teachers' overall
   critical thinking disposition significantly. However, research results
   revealed that the scores that pre-service teachers have achieved from
   self-confidence and open-mindedness sub-factors of the inventory have
   significantly differentiated in favor of the pre-service teachers in the
   experimental group. The statements that pre-service teachers have made
   on their comments were weak in terms of critical thinking. Pre-service
   teachers have mostly expressed their own views and they have usually
   supported each other by providing positive opinions. Therefore, it is
   thought that online communities of practice affect positively only
   pre-service teachers' self-confidence tendency and the abilities to
   express their own opinions.},

Abstract = {This research examined the importance of empathy, which was regarded as
   one of the elements that might assist in accelerating the manifestation
   of group creativity, and studied the actual state of empathic ability of
   Korean elementary school students. For such, a cognitive and affective
   empathic ability test was conducted over 228 students that were in their
   fifth and sixth grades of public elementary school in Korea, and this
   result was indirectly compared with preceding research results of the
   United States and the Netherlands, which had studied the empathic
   ability over students in a similar age range as the research subjects.
   As a result of the research, Korean elementary school students appeared
   to have higher cognitive empathic ability than affective empathic
   ability. In particular, the mean score of perspective taking of Korean
   elementary school students, in cognitive empathy, appeared to be
   relatively higher than the mean score of the elementary school students
   in the United States and the Netherlands. The mean score of fantasizing
   appeared to be lower than the mean score of perspective taking, while
   failing to reach the mean. Moreover, empathic concern of Korean
   elementary school students, in affective empathy, appeared to be
   relatively lower than the mean score of elementary school students of
   the United States and the Netherlands. Moreover, the mean score of
   empathic awakening appeared to be higher than the mean score of empathic
   concern, however, the mean score of emphatic awakening appeared to have
   failed to reach the mean. The educational implications for such have
   been discussed.},

Abstract = {Many attempts at personalisation have been made in education. They all
   collect learning data and analyse learning behaviours, and ultimately
   achieve personalised learning dynamically. However, further research is
   needed on the ways to effectively access and analyse information about
   learning within an enjoyable environment and with positive results when
   realising personalised learning. In order to solve this problem, we
   connect the time in class and after class with semantic knowledge and
   combine these elements with gamification and a better interaction
   experience. We explore whether this teaching method can offer students a
   better learning experience and positive learning outcomes. Our approach
   plays an obvious role in personalised learning. Our results indicate
   that a teaching method which connects the two parts of a class with
   gamification and a means of interaction in AR (augmented reality)
   produces novel and enjoyable feelings, stimulates students' enthusiasm
   and improves the learning effects when they do personalised learning.},

Abstract = {Along with the information technology rising, Computer Aided Design
   activities are becoming more modern and more complex. But learning how
   to operation these new design tools has become the main problem lying in
   front of each designer. This study was purpose on finding problems
   encountered during code-based design tools learning period of designers,
   especially those influential factors. The research was based on two
   design protocol analysis studies. A pilot study was performed for
   research details adjustment. Three selected participants have been told
   to complete one sketching work with two different digital design tools.
   A 30 minutes teaching was performed on each participant. Processing was
   introduced for data analysis. We found digital methods can be used to
   performing design process analyzing. We construct a multi-scale
   analyzing structure for design process and we demonstrate the
   possibility of pure quantitative study of the design process.},

Abstract = {Science inquiry activities carried out in a small group are
   learner-centered activities operating under the premise of collaborative
   interaction between members through various types of communication and
   consultation in the process of resolving issues. The changes in the
   types of interactions in the three exploratory activities targeting
   science-gifted students were analyzed using the Social Network Analysis
   (SNA). As a result of analyzing eight small groups, it was possible to
   divide the interaction types into two groups, namely, the alienation
   retaining type-where the type of interactions was retained from start to
   end-and the alienation changing type where the types of interactions
   changed. First, regarding active interactions between three members, the
   remaining students turned out to be alienated and could not participate
   in further inquiry activities. Second, changes of types occurred in
   accordance with the leaders' central positions. On the basis of this
   study, it is expected that future analyses will show how the type of
   interaction changes according to the level of inquiry or familiarity
   status with the inquiry topics. In addition, it is expected that studies
   about guidance and feedback of teachers and new students' participation
   in the interactions will follow.},

   approaches to cross-analyze the empirical questionnaires of senior high
   schools in Changhua and Taichung regions in Taiwan from four brief
   analytical perspectives, including Individual Demand Competency (IDC),
   Professional Knowledge Competency (PKC), Resource Satisfaction
   Competency (RSC) and Cooperative Relationship Competency (CRC). Based on
   the results of evaluated measurements, the four most decisive TCDs for
   constructing the potential LOR are ``reading competency for IDC{''},
   ``cross-subjects and empirical teaching competencies for PKC{''},
   ``convincing competency for RSC{''} and ``cooperative competency{''}
   which is the most ponderable contribution of this research. Furthermore,
   in order to survive in the lowest birth-rate and highest
   democratic-rights education era, Taiwanese senior high schools must
   concretely put more school's administrative resource and aggressively
   collect more sponsoring from non-for-profit education organizations and
   governmental education departments to provide a series of empirical and
   digital on-job certificate programs and training license courses to
   assist teachers to nurture these most critical TCDs including reading,

Abstract = {Education is now an indicator of national modernization that countries
   in the world intend to promote the national quality and cultivate
   talents for national development through education. Especially, when
   human societies get into the 21st century, global societies, politics,
   economy, and culture are facing major changes. With the development of
   technology, the advance of the Internet, and the popularity of mobile
   devices, learning outside the classroom is no longer a problem and
   learning combined with authentic contexts becomes easier. When mobile
   devices are developed to connect to the network, it starts the mobile
   learning stage and ubiquitous learning becomes the easily accessible
   reality. Having Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fujian
   Normal University, and Fujian Huaqiao University as the research
   objects, total 348 students of two classes each from the three
   universities are selected as the research objects in this study. The
   research results conclude 1.significantly positive correlations between
   context awareness and self-efficacy, 2.remarkably positive correlations
   between self-efficacy and learning motivation, and 3.notably positive
   correlations between context awareness and learning motivation.
   According to the research results, suggestions are proposed in this
   study, expecting to assist in the development of education.},

Abstract = {The advancement of mobile game-based learning has encouraged many
   related studies, which has enabled students to learn more and faster. To
   enhance the clinical path of cardiac catheterization learning, this
   paper has developed a mobile 3D-CCGBLS (3D Cardiac Catheterization
   Game-Based Learning System) with a learning assessment for cardiac
   catheterization, and which also evaluates the learning effectiveness,
   based on ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction)
   theory. This study implemented a quasi-experimental design, using 102
   students with the relevant medical background, divided into three
   groups. The learning achievements of this study show that the
   experimental group achieved higher scores than both control groups. The
   statistical analysis of the learning motivation and learning achievement
   shows ARCS-R (Relevance) as the most important factor, followed by of
   ARCS-C (Confidence). The results show that the learning content was
   relevant to the learner's level, and that it brought more confidence and
   increased the effectiveness of learning.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the use of technology to improve teaching and learning
   experiences in the classroom has been promoted. One of these
   technologies is augmented reality, which allows overlaying layers of
   virtual information on real scene with the aim of increasing the
   perception that user has of reality. Augmented reality has proved to
   offer several advantages in the educational context, i. e. increasing
   learning engagement and increasing understanding of some topics,
   especially when spatial skills are involved. Contents deployed in an
   augmented reality application are of two types, static, i. e. text, or
   dynamic, i. e. animations. As far as we know no research project has
   assessed how the type of content, static or dynamic, can affect the
   student learning perception and performance in augmented reality
   applications. In this article the development and evaluation of an
   augmented reality application using static and dynamic content is
   described. In order to determine how the type of content affects the
   learning perception and performance of the student, two experimental
   designs in which the student interact with the application, using static
   and dynamic contents, for learning topics related with an electronic
   fundamentals course was performed.},

Abstract = {This study focused on formative use of peer feedback in an online system
   that was used in basic computer literacy for word processing
   assignment-related purposes. Specifically, the effect of quantity,
   modality and satisfaction of peer feedback provided through the online
   system on students' performance, self-efficacy, and technology
   acceptance was investigated. Participants were 32 freshmen elementary
   and Turkish education pre-service teachers who were enrolled in two
   sections of the mandatory Computer I course in a public university in
   Turkey in the fall semester of 2013. Groups of students who submitted
   their assignments and received feedback in varying quantity and two
   different forms (text or text and video together) did not differ
   respectively in terms of students' performance test scores as well as
   self-efficacy and technology acceptance ratings. Students' feedback
   satisfaction ratings were significantly correlated only with their
   technology acceptance scores. All results were interpreted with the
   support of peer feedback content in both text and video formats to
   clarify the details and contribute more to the literature.},

Abstract = {Although learning can occur in many environments e. g. science museum or
   zoo, some studies reported that teachers are prone to avoid outdoor
   activities since they lack of field trip training. For that reason; this
   study aims to explore the effect of the exhibition on preservice science
   teachers' views about global climate change (GCC) as well as teaching
   drawing technique. The visiting of American National History Museum's
   ``Climate Change: The Threat to Life and A New Energy Future{''}
   exhibition allows to see how individual, communal, and governmental
   actions in using energy more efficiently, in combination with pursuing
   promising new energy alternatives, can make a meaningful impact in
   reducing GCC. Data analysis revealed that they have learned drawing
   technique which is an effective way to obtain students' perceptions.
   Additionally, the effect of exhibition on preservice teachers' awareness
   and knowledge of GCC showed clearly changing and teachers'
   self-confidence have been increased to use outdoor activities. Moreover,
   with this field trip experience let them to transfer their understanding
   about informal learning into classroom practice.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
   pre-service elementary teachers' mathematics teaching beliefs and
   mathematics anxiety. The participants of the study consist of 96
   pre-service elementary teachers from a department of primary education
   in a state university in Turkey during the 2010-2011 spring term.
   Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale: Short Version and Beliefs about
   Teaching Mathematics Scale were used as the measuring instruments. The
   results reveal that pre-service elementary teachers' scores on beliefs
   about teaching mathematics were high whereas mathematics anxiety levels
   were low in general. The correlations between the sub-scales of the
   MARS-SV and child-centeredness beliefs are not significant at the 0.05
   level. As a result, some recommendations concerning the situation and
   future research were made.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the evaluation
   indicators of teaching competency in STEAM education. The teaching
   competencies in STEAM education were drawn up utilizing both behavioral
   event interview (BEI) and a literature review. The initial evaluation
   indicators were then reviewed by 15 experts and two pilot tests were
   conducted. The revised version was administrated to 208 teachers, and
   the data from this survey were used to validate the factor-based model
   used in exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor
   analysis (CFA). Final evaluation indicators of teaching competency in
   STEAM education were composed of 35 items in seven areas: Understanding
   of Subjects (five items); Teaching-Learning Methods (eight items);
   Inducing Learners to Participate in Learning (five items); Understanding
   of Learners (four items); Learning Environments and Circumstances (five
   items); Evaluation of Learners (four items); and Individual
   Qualification (four items). These evaluation indicators are a guideline
   on understanding what really matters in STEAM education and how to
   perform a STEAM class. Therefore, the results of this study can be
   standards of improving their STEAM classes by self-diagnosis, and used
   as consultation checklists for an effective STEAM class.},

Abstract = {Supporting the increase of environmental consciousness with
   environmental education is always important in order to make healthy
   recommendations specific to the countries. Aim of this study is to
   determine the awareness and consciousness of the local community against
   the environmental pollution caused by the CMC mine by survey technique.
   123 participants took part in this research on a voluntary basis. From
   1913, the copper mine mineral ore industry in Karavostasi, Lefka was
   carried out by a Cypriot mining company, Cyprus Mining Corporation
   (CMC). After it was terminated in 1974 and all the wastes during the
   operation process were left alone, forming a death valley. In
   Karavostasi, there are ore wastes, chemical wastes, scraps from the
   termination of the factory, recumbent between the sea and mine operation
   and mineral stratum which increase the environmental problems every
   passing day and polluting Eastern Mediterranean specifically and all of
   the Mediterranean in general causing an increase in pollution and
   threatening biological life. Wastes poured into the sea without any
   supervision during CMC operation caused the region and the beach to be
   polluted significantly. The answers participants have given to the
   questions in the survey has shown that the environmental pollution
   caused by CMC where they live, is the most important environmental
   problem. Second most important environmental problem was found as water
   and sea pollution.},

Abstract = {We have developed a process-oriented chemistry laboratory curriculum for
   non-science majors. The purpose of this study is both to explore
   university students' understanding of chemistry processes and to
   evaluate the quality of evidence students use to support their claims
   regarding chemistry processes in a process-oriented chemistry laboratory
   course. The data were collected from four classes offered during the
   first two semesters in which the new curriculum was implemented. We
   analyzed students' written laboratory reports, which included the
   components of claims, evidence, and reflection, to investigate their
   understanding of the process skills required in knowledge construction
   in chemistry. We also evaluated the quality of evidence the students
   used to support their claims regarding chemistry processes by using
   five-level criteria which we developed. The findings of this study show
   that a process-oriented laboratory curriculum contributes to developing
   university students' understanding of chemistry processes and the
   ability to link appropriate and sufficient evidence to their claims. The
   findings of this study also imply that there are specific types of
   process skills which are unique or more necessary for chemistry
   research, and these skills can be developed through a process-oriented
   chemistry laboratory curriculum.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to adapt the Mentoring Relationship
   Effectiveness Scale to Turkish, and to conduct validity and reliability
   tests regarding the scale. The study group consisted of 156 university
   science students receiving graduate education. Construct validity and
   factor structure of the scale was analyzed first through exploratory
   factor analysis, then with confirmatory factor analysis. One item was
   deleted from the scale after the exploratory factor analysis and the
   scale was observed in its original one dimensional form. The
   confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the one dimensional model of
   the scale was acceptable. Reliability of the scale was examined with
   test-retest and internal consistency (Cronbach Alpha) methods. The
   internal consistency coefficient for the whole scale was 0.936. The
   reliability coefficient for the test-retest, which was carried out two
   weeks apart, was 0.89. The findings suggest that Mentoring Relationship
   Effectiveness Scale is sufficiently reliable and valid for science
   education of graduate students.},

Abstract = {Elementary school teachers' having a positive attitude toward science
   teaching might encourage students to develop positive attitudes toward
   science learning. This cross-cultural study aimed to validate the
   seven-factor structure of the Dimensions of Attitude toward Science
   (DAS) scale by applying it in two countries. Moreover, it aimed to
   determine the percentage distributions of in-service elementary school
   teachers' attitudes on the confirmed seven categories. The DAS scale was
   translated into Turkish and Spanish and administered to 185 teachers in
   Burdur and 202 teachers in Almeria. Multi-group confirmatory factor
   analysis confirmed that the factor structures of the translated scales
   for the two countries correspond to the same seven-factor structure by
   fitting the theoretical model. The DAS scale was compatible for both
   countries at an adequate level. In both samples, most of the teachers
   were against gender stereotyping in the science teaching/learning
   process, and they indicated they did not have any anxiety, fear, or
   stress toward teaching science. The crucial difference between the two
   samples was seen in the teachers' responses to items measuring
   ``Enjoyment{''} and ``Perceived Dependency Context Factors.{''}},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between the
   professional values and critical thinking disposition of
   science-technology and mathematics teachers working in middle schools.
   The survey research method was employed in the study. The sample of the
   study is comprised of 193 teachers (90 science-technology and 103
   mathematics teachers) working in middle schools located in the city
   center of Afyonkarahisar, as well as the villages in the same province
   during the 2013-2014 academic school year. Teachers' Professional Values
   Scale (TPVS) and California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory
   (CCTDI) were used as data gathering tools in the study. The data was
   analyzed through descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA and correlation
   analyses. The results of the study indicate that the level of teachers'
   having professional values is higher than middle level and their level
   of critical thinking disposition is low. Besides, there is a meaningful
   level of relation between teachers' professional values and critical
   thinking disposition.},

Abstract = {Monolingual or multilingual students with low academic language
   proficiency need to acquire conceptual understanding for percentages and
   the language to communicate about them. The design research study
   explores how these two learning goals can be fostered by a
   macro-scaffolding approach for seventh grade students. The dual
   hypothetical learning trajectory starts from students' prior experiences
   and guides them, via several levels, towards the mathematical models and
   meanings (conceptual learning trajectory) as well as towards the
   necessary vocabulary for thinking and communicating about them (lexical
   learning trajectory), linked by the percent bar. For lexical
   scaffolding, the processes of offering, building and reflecting lexical
   means on different levels are focused. The qualitative empirical
   investigations of the design experiments show in depth how students'
   conceptual understanding evolved together with the lexical means. For
   this purpose, the interpretative reconstruction of semiotic chains is
   instrumental.},

Abstract = {The use of e-learning techniques in higher education is becoming ever
   more frequent. In some institutions, e-learning has completely replaced
   the traditional teaching methods, while in others it supplements
   classical courses. The paper presents a study conducted in a member
   institution of the University of Ljubljana that provides public
   administration programmes. We analysed the relationship between the
   proportion of the course implemented in the Moodle e-learning platform
   and students' performance on one hand and their satisfaction on the
   other. The empirical findings reveal a positive correlation for both
   elements. The results can help decision-makers learn more about how to
   enhance students' success and satisfaction using an e-learning platform.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate pre-service physics teachers'
   metacognitive knowledge about their teaching practices. The participants
   included six pre-service physics teachers. A taxonomy of metacognition
   for teaching was developed to analyze the level of pre-service physics
   teachers' metacognitive knowledge about their teaching practices.
   Analysis of data showed that pre-service physics teachers' metacognitive
   knowledge about their content knowledge was quite satisfactory; however,
   their metacognitive knowledge about instructional methods, students'
   pre-instructional knowledge, and the task of teaching needs to be
   improved. The results of the study provided evidence that metacognitive
   knowledge on teaching is a fruitful framework to generate
   interpretations about the participants' instructional processes.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted using a new hybrid method of research which
   combined qualitative and quantitative designs to investigate the
   viewpoints of primary school students' conceptual understanding in
   learning geometry from the aspect of shapes and spaces according to van
   Hiele theory. Q-methodology is used in this research to find out what
   factors (level) of geometry understanding in van Hiele theory
   contributed to the geometry learning of primary school children.
   Q-methodology involved creating a concourse - Q set which was developed
   through a literature review and the statements were later refined by
   experts and then conducted to 30 participants aged 12 at a primary
   school. The respondents expressed their understanding through Q sorting,
   by ranking strategies according to their geometry understanding. The
   results indicated that students' van Hiele Levels of Geometry Thinking
   are at the factor (a) Level 1 - Analysis (or Descriptive); and factor
   (b) Level 0 - Recognition (or Visualization). This common outcome
   revealed that the students' geometry understanding according to van
   Hiele theory is at the lower level. Significantly, the findings indicate
   that the deficiency of van Hiele Levels of Geometry Thinking appears to
   be global in nature, crossing the boundaries of educational practices
   and curriculum.},

Abstract = {Integrating theory with practice has become a mandatory requirement for
   universities of technology. Using educational technology to supplement
   traditional pedagogical approaches has contributed significantly to
   achieving this mandate. However, which educational technologies could
   help improve the educational experience of students in a statistical
   service course? This research uses an exploratory design, where one
   large group of undergraduate students were polled using a questionnaire
   as the main data collection tool. Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint
   presentations were viewed as a very good supplemental educational tool,
   while YouTube clips, myVUT (institutional learning management system
   using Sakai) and the business/financial calculator were not fully
   utilised by the students. However, the majority of students selected the
   prescribed textbook as the most useful educational tool in understanding
   first year statistics, as it was a locally published textbook with many
   native examples. A blend of all these educational technologies helped to
   enrich student understanding and satisfaction in learning statistical
   concepts.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the statuses on the publishing and usage
   of college biochemistry textbooks in China. A textbook database was
   constructed and the statistical analysis was adopted to evaluate the
   textbooks. The results showed that there were 945 (similar to 57\%)
   books for theory teaching, 379 (similar to 23\%) books for experiment
   teaching and 331 (similar to 20\%) books for assistant teaching. Most of
   these books were published for science/technology-associated
   universities, followed by medical schools, while the books for
   agricultural universities were relatively few. Additionally, the first
   decade of the 21st century was the most productive period.
   Interestingly, there were 456 (similar to 28\%) textbooks with the same
   name of ``Biochemistry{''}, professor Airu Zhou was the most productive
   editor, and People's Medical Publishing House was the most productive
   press. The further survey showed that ``Biochemistry{''} (3rd Edition)
   edited by professor Jingyan Wang et al was the most influential
   textbook. Overall, the findings suggest that the publishing and usage
   have been achieved a great success in college education along with some
   practical problems.},

Abstract = {Learning electromagnetics often involves dealing with problems with
   strong mathematical skills or thinking about problems in abstract and
   multiple spaces. Moreover, many students are often unable to explain
   some related physical phenomena using the appropriate electromagnetic

   pedagogies in science education. Those were STS (science, technology and
   society) instruction and guided discovery approach by designing some
   alternative experiments on electromagnetics at university undergraduate
   level. Based on a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system, three
   sets of scientific investigation activities are specifically designed
   for helping undergraduate physics and engineering students explore the
   electromagnetic phenomena in real-world situations and acquire a better
   understanding of the inter-relationship amongst science, technology and

Abstract = {This study investigated the impact of a one-day conservation education
   workshop on knowledge about and attitudes towards species of 88 students
   from Valle Fertil, Argentina. Immediately before and after the workshop
   and one year later, students (aged 12 to 16) had to identify native and
   introduced exotic plant and animal species as well as artificial ones
   ({''}Simpsons{''}) on flashcards, to point out those ``species{''} they
   considered most beautiful and useful, and to name adaptations of local
   species to arid conditions. Immediately after the workshop, students
   strongly increased their knowledge about plants and adaptations. One
   year later, this was still the case for those plant species students had
   been already somewhat familiar with in the pretest. The workshop hardly
   changed attitudes.},

Abstract = {This qualitative research is based on mathematical problem solving and
   modeling. In this study I analyzed 39 junior year prospective classroom
   teachers' experiences while they were enrolled in the ``Teaching
   Experience{''} course and visiting public primary schools. More
   specifically, I examined teaching mathematical problem solving and
   modeling by content analysis of the qualitative data. The participants
   were given a six-hours training about problem solving and modeling prior
   to data collection. The findings were as follows: prospective teachers
   i) became more familiar with the nature of problem solving after the
   teaching practice; they had difficulties in choosing problems and in
   teaching due to insufficient experience; they had difficulties in
   finding non-routine problem situations; iv) they formed sympathy for
   mathematics teaching through problem solving approach by using modeling;
   v) the pupils at the host schools were willing to engage in such
   activities, and they used positive expressions about their learning
   experiences.},

Abstract = {By the 1970s a fundamental shift had taken place in German science
   education. This was a shift away from the learning of more-or-less
   isolated facts and facets in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics towards a
   restructuring of science teaching along the general principles of the
   respective science domains. The changes included also the addition of
   dimensions such as problem-based learning, understanding the basics of
   the Nature of Science, and engaging students in the methods of science.
   Since then, practical work has been solidly built into German science
   syllabi for each one of the separate teaching domains in school science.
   However, research evidence shows that practical work is still limited in
   many science classrooms. In many cases, hands-on work is only present as
   either teacher demonstrations or as cookbook-style recipe experiments
   for pupils. The shortcomings of such practice have also become evident
   in the TIMSS and PISA studies conducted since 1997. However, the
   outcomes published by PISA 2000 also initiated further change in
   Germany. For the first time ever, national science education standards
   were introduced for lower secondary science education. In 2004, these
   standards sharpened the focus of learning more prominently on how to
   practically carry out science tasks. The resulting reform led to
   research and development activity in different fields of innovation,
   among them science education practical work. This paper gives an account
   of the development of practical science work in German schools and it
   discusses the most prominent trends in practical science efforts in
   German secondary science education which have taken place in recent
   years.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore cross-country (Taiwan versus India)
   differences in students' perceptions of online leaning by gender. The
   self-reported instrument, POSTOL (Perception of Students towards Online
   Learning), was conducted to the students from Taiwan and India. Of the
   total 441 respondents, there were 233 students from India and 208 from
   Taiwan. A 2x2 between-subjects multivariate analysis of variance was
   employed on the four dimensions of the POSTOL scale. This scale consists
   of four dimensions: instructor characteristics, social presence,
   instructional design, and trust. Results showed that there were
   significant differences, between India and Taiwan, in the perception of
   students towards online learning. However, there was no significant
   interaction effect of country by gender. Findings indicated that culture
   did influence students' perceptions towards online learning. There is a
   need to raise awareness about factors that may affect online learning
   experience and to provide guidance and for practice and future work.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of problem solving
   instruction on 126 middle school students' learning of physical science
   in terms of their scientific knowledge, scientific concept dependent
   reasoning and problem solving ability. This study used a
   quasi-experiment with one factorial design of instructional approaches
   (problem solving and traditional hands-on learning). Sixty-one students
   participated in problem solving while sixty-five students participated
   in traditional hands-on learning. Results indicate that the problem
   solving group significantly outperformed the traditional hands-on
   learning group for both immediate and retaining effect, regardless of
   scientific knowledge, scientific concept dependent reasoning and
   scientific problem solving abilities. The regression results also
   indicated that the scientific concept dependent reasoning test is the
   best predictor for scientific problem solving ability, followed by
   scientific knowledge itself. Our study demonstrates that students'
   scientific knowledge, reasoning and problem solving all are successfully
   improved after receiving six weeks scientific problem solving.},

Abstract = {Student Information System is one of the key systems for facilitating
   the management and development of Higher Education Institutions. Its use
   for academic decision-making purposes as well as other academic tasks is
   crucial. Therefore, this paper aims to understand the impact of System
   Quality, Information Quality and Information Presentation on Student
   Information System satisfaction of academic and administrative staff. In
   this study, System satisfaction survey is carried out and factor
   analysis and regression tests are applied to interpret the collected
   data. The results show that only Information Quality has direct effect
   on satisfaction. Then the impact of decision-making as a mediator factor
   on system satisfaction is measured and the results reveal that System
   Quality and Information Quality has indirect significant effect whereas
   Information Presentation does not have direct nor indirect effect on
   system satisfaction.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted so as to determine prospective teachers'
   perceptions of the concept of ``social media{''} through metaphors. The
   study group was composed of 138 prospective biology teachers attending
   Hacettepe and Gazi universities in 2015-2016 academic year. The
   participants were given the semi-structured interview form containing
   the statement ``Social media is like ... because ...{''} And they were
   asked to complete the statement. The technique of content analysis was
   used in assessing the data collected. MAXQDA 12, a program for
   qualitative data analysis, was used in analysing the data. Having
   analysed the data, they were interpreted. Accordingly, 30.43\% of the
   prospective teachers perceived the concept of social media as a harmful
   element, the great majority of them (66.67\%) perceived the concept
   positively as an educational, technological, entertaining, indispensable
   part of life and as an instrument of communication.},

Abstract = {The urgency of the problem under investigation is due to the role of
   mathematical modeling in modern science and human practice, which
   requires the acquaintance of students with the elements of this process
   at the early stages of education. Training of mathematical modeling
   shows the students how to apply mathematics in real life, which is also
   a motivation for learning the subject. The purpose of the research is to
   identify elements of mathematical modeling that can and should be
   appropriately formed at the secondary school. The leading method of the
   research is the analysis of the structure of the mathematical modeling
   process and the development of a system of tasks aimed to form training
   activities that are adequate to the identified elements. The authors
   offer to use the system of changed tasks contained in school mathematics
   textbooks. The article proves the necessity of acquaintance of
   schoolchildren with the structure of the process of mathematical
   modeling, features of models, purpose of their use. As a result of the
   research, the authors present a model of the system of problems aimed to
   form elements of mathematical modeling relating to the stages of
   formalization and interpretation. The methodology proposed in the
   article can be used by mathematics teachers at lessons and elective
   courses, authors of textbooks and manuals, and also can be the basis for
   special courses for students of pedagogical universities.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to examine the roles of growth need strength and the
   perceived benefits of innovation as antecedent predictors of students'
   intentions to participate in patent activities using the theory of
   planned behaviour (TPB). This study compared three models that predicted
   business and management students' intentions to perform patent
   activities. Results from structural equation modelling applied to
   undergraduate students supported that the effects of growth need
   strength and the perceived benefits of innovation influenced students'
   intentions through a TPB model with the antecedents of attitude,
   subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The research
   proposed model was superior to the other models and explained 74\% of
   the variance in behavioral intentions to engage in patent activities.
   Implications and directions for future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Using the mixed methods approach this study examines Turkish Cypriots'
   medium of instruction policies from their settlement to Cyprus to now.
   Through the use of document analysis relevant studies have been
   examined. Findings demonstrate ideologies and methods of governance of
   nations that ruled Cyprus influenced the language policy. Though either
   Turkish, Greek or English was the official language of Cyprus, Cypriot
   Turks have always followed Turkey for their policy of medium of
   instruction. The language used in Turkey has always been the orthodox
   and respected language for Cypriot Turks. However, the medium of
   instruction in English brought on by the British during the colonial
   period has maintained its importance. Today, this is not due to a
   loyalty to Britain, but results from the desire to educate individuals
   for the global world.},

Abstract = {The relevance of research: Modern transformations in society and
   education pay special attention to the increase of the quality of
   teaching staff training, making new requests for competitive specialists
   in the world labor-market. According to the demands of educational laws
   and regulations, modern teacher is meant to be competent in his own
   sphere of work, have a number of professional skills, be flexible and
   mobile, be capable to work efficiently in compliance with international
   standards, be prepared for professional and personal growth. At the same
   time, an increased competition at the world labor-market requires new
   approaches to training future teachers with regard to increased demands
   for the specialists who are capable to adapt to modern world standards.
   The purpose of the research: The purpose of this research is to identify
   efficient forms and means of academic mobility of future foreign
   language teachers. Research methods: The leading research method that
   tests hypothesis is pedagogical experiment (ascertaining, forming and
   control stages of experiment) and also the method of processing of
   quantitative results of the research. 270 future foreign language
   teachers took part in the experimental research where 138 respondents
   belonged to an experimental group and 132 future teachers belonged to a
   control group. Results of the research: the model of formation of
   academic mobility of future foreign language teachers was designed and
   scientifically grounded. Formation of academic mobility is implemented
   by means of media-education technologies, methodological principles
   which include systemic, competency-based, synergetic, student-oriented
   approach and the following principles such as humanization, viability,
   self-education, succession, continuity, dialogism. The proposed model
   was realized in three stages (motivational-cognitive, organizational-
   action-based, professional-communicative) and provided for gradual
   acquisition by future educators the motivation for academic migration
   and their ability to master their foreign language communicative
   competence. The purpose of the above mentioned model is to develop such
   personal qualities which will contribute to students' readiness to get
   education in foreign educational environment. The result of the
   realization of the model is the formation of the academic mobility of
   foreign language teachers on a creative level. Relevance of the
   research: The efficiency of the proposed model of formation of academic
   mobility of future foreign language teachers by means of media education
   technologies has been proved and confirmed by the statistics of the
   experiment. Materials of the article can be useful for students,
   teachers of educational institutions of higher education, foreign
   language teachers who write projects, course works, qualifying projects
   and other types of scientific works.},

Abstract = {Underpinned by a holistic, dynamic, and process-oriented view of teacher
   competences, this study provides an analytic hierarchy system of
   instructional design competence (IDC) for evaluating teachers' IDC based
   on the mental model of instructional design. Additionally, this study
   quantitatively explores the IDC characteristics and correlations of 118
   preservice science teachers at Shanxi Normal University in China, who
   learned the ADTRE (analyzing, designing, teaching, revising, and
   evaluating/improving) instructional model, based on reflection and
   feedback. Using lesson planning (LP) scoring rubrics, we analyzed 113
   lesson plans from 56 participants majoring in biological science and 57
   in biological technology. We present the ADTRE model and discuss
   relationships between preservice science teachers' academic achievement
   and IDC. Major findings include a positive correlation between
   preservice science teachers' IDC scores and their course grades in
   Advanced Mathematics and Cell Biology and concept mapping skills. There
   was a negative correlation between preservice science teachers' IDC and
   course grades in Principles of Genetic Engineering and Technology, and
   no significant correlations existed between IDC and course grades for
   teacher education courses. Our findings reveal the nature of preservice
   science teachers' IDC, a potential for improvement in university teacher
   education curricula, and a need for further research.},

Abstract = {It is widely believed that teachers' knowledge of students' thinking has
   a significant impact on teachers' teaching and students' learning.
   However, there is far less research on how teachers acquire their
   knowledge of students' thinking before, during, and after lessons. This
   study is designed to compare the differences between expert and
   nonexpert mathematics teachers on their behaviors and perceptions
   related to understanding students' mathematical thinking. Based on 554
   Chinese elementary mathematics teachers' responses to a survey, the
   study found that teachers took actions to understand students' thinking
   more often when students were learning new topics or encountering
   difficulties, and they were more likely to do so before lessons than
   during or after lessons. The comparison revealed that significantly more
   expert elementary mathematics teachers attempted to understand students'
   thinking from a variety of perspectives before making the necessary
   adjustments to their predetermined teaching plans than did nonexpert
   teachers. Significantly more expert teachers also relied on their own
   teaching experiences to understand students' thinking. In contrast,
   significantly more nonexpert teachers claimed that they did not rely on

Abstract = {Crude oil price forecasting is one of the most important topics in the
   field of energy research. Accordingly, numerous methods such as
   statistical, econometrical and intelligent approaches are applied for
   crude oil price forecasting. In this paper, a typical competitive
   learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), is empirically
   investigated to verify the feasibility and potentiality of SVM in crude
   oil price forecasting. For this purpose, five different prediction
   models, feed-forward neural networks (FNN), auto-regressive integrated
   moving average (ARIMA) model, fractional integrated ARIMA (ARFIMA)
   model, Markov-switching ARFIMA (MS-ARFIMA) model, and random walk (RW)
   model are used in the study. Experimental results obtained show that the
   SVM model outperforms the other five methods, implying that it is a
   fairly good candidate for crude oil price forecasting in terms of either
   one-step prediction or multi-step prediction.},

Abstract = {Based on upper echelon theory and the perspective of value creation in
   the business model for technology start-ups, this paper explains the
   mechanism of top management team (TMT) heterogeneity on the performance
   of technology start-ups. Using survey data from 183 technology start-ups
   in China, the model is empirically tested. The findings demonstrate that
   age and tenure heterogeneity among TMT members significantly and
   positively affects the performance of technology start-ups While
   functional experience and educational level heterogeneity significantly
   and negatively affect their performance of technology start-ups.
   Moreover, the value creation of business models partially mediates the
   influences of age, tenure, functional experience and educational level
   heterogeneity among TMT members on the performance of technology
   start-ups.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to determine teacher and administrative staff
   views on, teachers' participation in school related decision-making
   process who serves in primary schools in Northern Cyprus. In the study,
   quantitative data were collected and the design of the study was
   determined as ``general screening model.{''} All of the administrators,
   serving in 2015-2016 school year in Famagusta, were attained (42
   administrator), however, only 274 of 392 teachers (69.9\% of the phase)
   completed the questionnaire. When we look at teacher and administration
   staff remarks, a significant difference was found in teachers'
   participation in educational and administrative decisions. This
   difference was in favour of educational decisions. A significant
   difference was not met in teacher and administrative staff views on
   teachers' participation in school related (educational+ administrative)
   decisions considering; gender, age, total working years as teacher,
   total working years at the school, task type, education level. However,
   teacher views significantly changed when schools' locations change. This
   difference was in favour of the teachers working in rural areas.
   Finally, when participant teachers' and administrators' views were
   compared, teachers' participation in school related (educational+
   administrative) decisions shows a meaningful difference. Administrative
   staff, in comparison to teachers, stated that teachers' participation
   has to be more in decision making process.},

Abstract = {The basic thought foundation of the integration and optimization of
   higher education resources is embodied in the concept of resource
   conservation and development, with the integration of limited off-campus
   resources, presenting the resource characteristics. Based on the
   regional development of resources, make full use of school-based
   education resources, and highlight regional resource fusion. Through the
   characteristics of higher education resources, further model and analyze
   the feasibility of coordination between educational resources. We put
   forward the thought of integrating the industrialization development of
   universities. Integrate and optimize the educational resources by
   combining the development of regional cultural industries. With the
   assistance of regional economic and industrial development, the
   industrial economy education resources are actively utilized. Based on
   the overall form of regional social development, the concept of resource
   saving higher education development is constructed. With the aim of
   saving resources, we can effectively optimize the concept of
   industrialization and integration of higher education resources. Promote
   the integration and optimization of regional industrialization
   resources, thus forming a substantive impact on the diversity and
   multi-channel of the development of higher education resources. It is
   demonstrated that the key to optimizing and integrating the resources of
   higher education is to explore the concept of resource conservation, and
   fully study its internal meaning and intrinsic value to reflect its
   function, thus promoting the integration of educational resources with a
   strong purpose and direction. The exploration of the resource-saving
   development of higher education systematically screen the resources of
   regional humanistic spirit and humanistic quality, which is conducive to
   promoting the integration of resource elements to promote the overall
   development of higher education, and develop new ideas for the
   development of educational resources for the overall construction of
   humanistic education resources, so as to make the development of
   humanistic education play a positive role in promoting the overall
   education.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurial teams play a crucial role in the success of
   entrepreneurship. But how does the heterogeneity of entrepreneurial
   teams affect entrepreneurial team decision-making? The role of team
   communication in the middle has not yet been explored deeply. This paper
   takes the entrepreneurial team of college students in China as the
   research object, and empirically explores the relationship among
   Entrepreneurial Team Heterogeneity, Team Communication, and
   Entrepreneurial Decision-making. This paper finds: (1) Entrepreneurial
   team heterogeneity (internal and external heterogeneity) positively
   influences entrepreneurial decision-making; (2) Entrepreneurial team
   communication positively influences entrepreneurial decision-making; (3)
   Entrepreneurial team communication plays an intermediary role in
   entrepreneurial team heterogeneity (internal and external heterogeneity)
   and entrepreneurial decision-making process. At the same time, the
   conclusions of this study have brought us useful practical inspiration:
   Although all members of the entrepreneurial team had certain differences
   in gender, age, education and other aspects, and their views on the same
   issue also had certain differences, the team members were closely
   related to each other as a whole. In order to enhance mutual
   understanding of the team members and to promote consensus among them,
   team members must often communicate. Frequent and effective team
   communication develops entrepreneurial decision-making. Therefore,
   members of the entrepreneurial team should communicate in a variety of
   ways to guide them adequately and effectively.},

Abstract = {The aim of study is determining the set of variables which explain a
   student anxiety towards mathematics, as well as the student attitude
   towards the use of technology in PLM. To do this, the RMARS and MTAS
   scales were used. The instruments were applied to 522 undergraduate
   students at ITSON. The statistical procedure was EFA. The results
   obtained for the RMARS scale are: Bartlett's Test of Sphericity with KMO
   (0.689), chi(2) of 603.529 with 3 df and sig. 0.000 p<0.00, MSA Measure
   of Sampling Adequacy all more than >0.5, with an eigenvalue (2.219)
   which explains the 73.955 \% of the total variance. In the MTAS Scale,
   Bartlett's Test of Sphericity obtains a KMO value (0.678), chi(2) of
   427.405 with 10 df and sig. 0.000 with MSA values more than >0.5 in all
   cases, indicating that the variables of the MTAS Scale allow for
   establishing students' attitude towards mathematics and towards learning
   it using technology. The empirical evidence obtained allows us to
   believe that the use of technology may be a variable influencing
   students' attitude towards the process of teaching-learning mathematics
   measured using ICT, and that anxiety over mathematics may be a factor
   which determines this attitude.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the role of political skills in
   entrepreneurship education and the impact of social network, tacit
   knowledge, and innovation constructs. This study sought to investigate
   the conceptual relationship between political skills and tacit
   knowledge, social network and tacit knowledge, as well as innovation and
   tacit knowledge. The existence of the three construct and their effect
   on entrepreneur skill has been reviewed and discussed. This has been
   corroborated across studies that sought to establish the role of social
   networks, tacit knowledge, and innovation in influencing
   entrepreneurship. The performance of enterprise has closely being linked
   on the ability of individuals to take advantage of the social network
   and the individual as well as collective tacit knowledge to understand
   the business environment and come up with practical skills to counter
   the potential entrepreneurship risks. This study also addresses the
   impact of tacit knowledge on innovation. Tacit knowledge has both
   negative and positive effects on innovation, emanating from the
   transferability of innovations across individuals and firms.},

Abstract = {Knowledge is an endless resource as well as the key source of
   competitive advantage for enterprises. In the era of globalization with
   knowledge economy and network economy, the internationalization growth
   of enterprises is facing new challenges. Under such situations, an
   enterprise has to stress on the resource integration of internal network
   and reduce international business risks by developing the external
   network relationship to enhance the internationalization performance.
   With on-site questionnaire distribution and collection, enterprises with
   export-oriented manufacturing in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang areas
   are distributed 400 copies of questionnaire in this study. Total 302
   valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 75.5\%. The research
   results are summarized as below. 1. Dual network embeddedness presents
   significantly positive effects on organizational learning. 2. Dual
   network embeddedness shows remarkably positive effects on
   internationalization performance. 3. Organizational learning reveals
   notably positive effects on internationalization performance. It is
   expected to apply the research results to the internationalization
   growth or transnational business development of enterprises, to enhance
   the strategic performance and financial performance, and to be the
   reference for research on network embeddedness and organizational
   learning.},

Abstract = {The research aims at finding out how the development of social learning
   model based on metacognitive strategies or PS MEDIM model fosters the
   mathematics self-efficacy of students which is valid, practical, and
   effective. In order to obtain the valid, practical, and effective model,
   instruments and learning tools are well developed. The product of this
   research is a social learning model based on metacognitive strategies
   that can foster self-efficacy in mathematics. The development is
   conducted simultaneously. When developing the model, instruments and
   tools that support learning model of PS MEDIM are also developed. This
   research is research development (developmental research) which refers
   to the modification of the development of Tjeerd Plomp model with 4
   phases of development. The first phase is a preliminary investigation.
   The second phase is designing. The third phase is realization. The
   fourth phase testing, evaluation, and revision. There is also a trial
   test of PS MEDIM learning model that is conducted in class XI IPA1 and
   XI IPA2 of SMAN 9 Makassar. There are some results of the research.
   First, the model, instruments, and the learning tools of PS MEDIM are
   valid. Second, the model of PS MEDIM is eligible to apply in the
   classroom. Third, the model of PS MEDIM does not meet the criteria of
   practicality. It indicates that the components of the model of PS MEDIM
   has not been implemented as expected and does not meet the criteria of
   effectiveness. From 4 criteria of effectiveness, there is only one
   criterion fulfilled. The students' positive response to the learning
   model of PS MEDIM, and other three criteria have not been met. The
   classical completeness is not reached. The student's activity has not
   been as expected. In addition, the teacher's ability for teaching and
   learning management is still in ``medium{''} category.},

Abstract = {Art forms change with the development of technology in different times,
   which constantly challenges art design education in different eras. The
   purpose of this article is to study how to offer art design education
   that meets the needs of technology in different times both in contents
   and philosophy. First, a general integration module is proposed via a
   deep analysis on the continuously integrating and developing
   relationship between arts and technology based on an understanding on
   art concept. Then, the trend of the combination of motion sensing
   technology to art forms is pointed out with a detailed introduction to
   motion sensing technology categories and their integration forms.
   Finally, a new era art design education concept that meets the trend of
   arts and technology integration as well as new art design education
   contents under the background of motion sensing technology are
   concluded.},

   scientific proficiency and have identified informal learning
   environments, interactive technologies, and an understanding of inquiry
   as ways to support this development. The Habitat Tracker project was
   developed in response to this need by developing a digitally-supported,
   inquiry-oriented curriculum focused on engaging elementary students in
   science practices in formal and informal settings. This study employed a
   mixed methods approach to explore how engagement in the project affected
   125 fourth and fifth grade elementary students' views of scientific
   inquiry and if certain aspects of scientific inquiry were shaped by
   student participation. The Views of Scientific Inquiry - Elementary
   School Version (VOSI-E), was administered before and after students had
   engaged with a three week Habitat Tracker curriculum and assessed
   aspects including the role of questions, diversity of methods,
   experiments and investigations, developing scientific explanations,
   supporting scientific explanations, predictions and hypotheses, role of
   subjectivity, role of creativity, and goal of science. VOSI-E responses
   were analyzed using a mixed methods approach. Chi-squared test results
   suggest that classroom learning coupled with visits to a wildlife center
   can help improve student understanding of scientific inquiry when
   integrated with technology-enhanced, field-based inquiries that
   emphasize the practices of science.},

Abstract = {This study developed an integrated-STEM CO2 dragster design course using
   3D printing technology. After developing a pre-engineering curriculum,
   we conducted a teaching experiment to assess students' differences in
   creativity, race forecast accuracy, and learning performance. We
   compared student performance in both 3D printing and manual creation of
   dragsters. One hundred and eighty-two participants in five classes of
   Grade 10 participated in this study. The results of the teaching
   experiment showed that students who used a 3D printer significantly
   outperformed those students who made their dragsters by hand in terms of
   both the novelty and sophistication of their dragsters. The students in
   the 3D printing group were able to forecast the outcomes of the race
   significantly more accurately than those in the group who made theirs by
   hand were. No significant difference in learning performance was found
   in the two groups. Based on these experimental results, the development
   of the curriculum and hands-on activities and the teaching
   recommendations were revised. This research has an impact on offering an
   effective approach to the design and implementation of digital
   manufacturing and pre-engineering curricula in the future.},

Abstract = {Peer assessment can expand the cognitive schemas of students, facilitate
   knowledge construction, and promote discussion and cooperative learning
   among students and their peers. In recent years, the application of the
   internet to conduct peer assessment activities has been widely
   implemented. The advantages of networked peer assessments over
   traditional paper assessments include greater anonymity, less paper
   consumption, and greater convenience for teachers in terms of monitoring
   student progress. However, students must possess adequate assessment
   professionalism in order to provide their peers with meaningful and
   constructive feedback. This study therefore introduced a mechanism to
   assign works to peers based on assessment professionalism. Under this
   mechanism, students review the work of their peers within the range of
   their assessment capabilities. This maintains students' motivation to
   learn as they assess and observe the works of their peers and improves
   their learning effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyze the relation between students.
   cognitive learning strategies and conceptions of learning biology. The
   two scales, ``Cognitive Learning Strategies{''} and ``Conceptions of
   Learning Biology{''}, were revised and adapted to biology in order to
   measure the students' learning strategies and conceptions of learning.
   First of all, it was found that students preferred higher-level
   conceptions of learning such as `increasing knowledge', seeing in a new
   way', and, understanding. to lower-level conceptions such as
   `memorizing', `preparing for exams', and `calculating and practicing'.
   According to the results of regression analysis, it was seen that
   `memorizing' and, application. was common among the high school students
   while predicting the cognitive learning strategies. Moreover, the
   students who had higher-level conceptions of learning had a tendency to
   use strategies such as ``organization,{''} ``elaboration,{''} and
   ``critical thinking.{''} The students who adopted ``memorizing{''} as a
   lower-level conception of learning preferred ``rehearsal{''} learning
   strategy. However, ``memorizing{''} as a lower level conception of
   learning also positively predicts ``organization,{''} ``elaboration{''}
   and ``critical thinking.{''} This special condition, which did not show
   parallelism with the related literature, was taken into consideration
   and interpreted when discussing the relational analysis of link between
   conceptions of learning and cognitive learning strategies.},

Abstract = {Early childhood quality education is a cornerstone in educational
   development. Many countries have started to develop their own preschool
   educational system in accordance with the European Union Standards,
   where learning English language and using technology are prerequisites.
   In this research, the peace context was used as a mediator for learning
   the English language. The study aimed to reveal the impact of learning
   through technology in the English language. It was conducted on
   five-year-old children (n = 18) in one class where the English language
   was the core subject. The acquisition of knowledge depended on in-class
   gamification activities and home activities. Each participant received
   an educational DVD to use at home that included all the materials for
   learning, such as words, songs, videos, and short films about peace in
   English. All materials were selected in according with the ``fair use
   policy{''} for educational purposes. The research process included an
   initial interview (checklist) in which content analyses were made. In
   addition, assessment software was developed based on the required
   analysis to explain statistical findings.},

Abstract = {Amphibians are one of the most threatened animal groups; however,
   attitudes and emotions toward them are mostly negative. One of the
   efforts, as a part of the cognitive dimension of nature protection,
   should be in the shifting of negative attitudes toward amphibians to
   positive ones. The purpose of this study was reevaluation of the Toad
   Attitude Questionnaire (TAQ), as well as assessment of lower and upper
   secondary school students' attitudes towards toads. The moderating role
   of grade, gender, reported direct experiences, their experiences with
   nature, or whether they live in rural or urban areas on student
   attitudes toward toads was assessed. The results show that the level of
   education, gender, and reported direct experiences with toads, influence
   student attitudes more than place of residence and reported number of
   visits to natural surroundings. The implications for school work based
   on our study are numerous, some of them opposing recent trends in
   replacement of real hands-on activities with virtual ones in zoology
   education. There is no reason that animals in a classroom should be
   regarded mainly as objects of dissection. Giving them the status of
   ambassadors representing billions of similar or different organisms from
   nature is a better approach.},

Abstract = {Elementary school remedial teaching has been promoted for many years in
   Taiwan but it has primarily been aimed at Chinese and mathematics with
   little attention being paid to natural sciences. Due to the current
   shortage of natural science teachers, along with limitations in school
   budget and manpower, it is difficult to put natural science remedial
   teaching into practice in elementary schools. This research attempts to
   establish a new model of remedial teaching that utilizes remote
   asynchronous video-based instruction to carry out centralized remedial
   teaching with 3D television and interactive response system. We focused
   on fourth graders whose science ranking was at the bottom quarter and
   examined if their grades have improved. Centralized remedial teaching
   was implemented once a week during school's noon break and lasted for 40
   minutes. The materials used, including the remedial 3D natural science
   lesson videos and interactive response test questions, were both
   produced by the university. They were transmitted through the Internet
   to elementary school teachers who played them on 3D television and
   students practiced and answered the questions in real time with
   plickers. Twenty fourth graders from different classes participated in
   remedial teaching for one semester; the average percentage of test grade
   ranking in natural science has progressed from 9.19\% to 24.12\% in
   their original classes. Previously, the average of T-score in natural
   science test was 35.80, and after remedial instruction, the T-score
   average was 42.39. The T-score average improvement is statistically
   significant (t= 3.34, p =.003). The research revealed that this
   instructional model can improve learning outcome in natural science for
   underachieving fourth graders, and through the questionnaire, it was
   also known that the students liked this remedial teaching approach.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine pre-school teachers' beliefs
   about teaching mathematics to young learners. In this context, we
   compared preschool teachers' beliefs with mathematical learning,
   talent-development- age appropriateness for mathematical learning, the
   nature of mathematics, the curriculum, teacher efficacy, and the
   teacher's role by taking into account the preschool teachers' graduation
   programs and their experiences. Data was collected from 139 pre-school
   teachers. The teachers were selected based on their teaching experiences
   and their graduation programs. A 32-item Likert-type ``Belief Scale
   towards Mathematics Learning and Teaching{''} was used to determine
   their views about teaching, and the nature of the pre-school mathematics
   teachers learning mathematics. The results of an ANOVA test to determine
   whether there was a statistically significant difference between the
   score averages the of their beliefs and teaching practice time and
   graduated program, revealed a significant difference among pre-school
   teachers about mathematics and the role of teachers on teaching.
   Furthermore, the test revealed that the more experienced teachers have a
   better understating of the curriculum and the children and indicated a
   positive change in their opinions in the scale's related section.},

   higher achievement. The results from TIMSS 2011 are consistent with
   previous assessments. This study explored the predictive effects of
   motivation toward learning science on science achievement among
   Malaysian and Singaporean eighth graders who participated in the TIMSS
   2011. In this study, students' interest in and liking of learning
   science, students' understanding about the importance and the usefulness
   of the science subject, and students' self-confidence or self-concept in
   their ability to learn science were measured. Secondary data of the
   study were obtained from 5,733 Malaysian students and 5,927 Singaporean
   students who participated in the TIMSS 2011. The results of the present
   study indicated that eighth-graders' liking and valuing of learning
   science were positively associated with Malaysian and Singaporean Grade
   8 students' science achievement.},

Abstract = {The statistics reveals that about many students have learning
   difficulties. For this reason, appropriate curricula and materials
   should be planned to match with multimedia teaching design in order to
   reduce students'learning frustration and obstacle caused by insufficient
   experiences and basic competence. Multimedia dynamic, a curriculum
   oriented teaching instrument combined with cognitive psychology,
   cognitive load theory, and multimedia teaching theory, could easily
   attract students `attention in the performing process so as to guide the
   learning, reduce the load of working memory, and further reduce the
   cognitive load. With multimedia dynamic presentation, teachers could
   design materials matching with class teaching for the attention guidance
   to help students actively search, select, and organize information,
   reduce the load of working memory and cognitive load, and enhance the
   learning effect. It is expected to apply multimedia dynamic teaching to
   attention guidance in this study. Under the principle of material
   design, multimedia dynamic teaching is regarded as the design subject
   and three classes are proceeded the teaching experiment. The results
   show that including images into structural text information presents
   significant effects on students'learning outcome and the reduction of
   cognitive load.},

Abstract = {The science education budget of many secondary schools has decreased,
   while shortages and environmental concerns linked to conventional
   Science Education Equipment and Materials (SEEMs) have emerged. Thus, in
   some schools, resourceful educators produce low-cost equipment from
   basic materials and use these so-called improvised SEEMs in practical
   work. However, scattered in the literature are diverse challenges linked
   to the production and/or use of improvised SEEMs. Thus, the purpose of
   the literature review presented here was to design a framework useful in
   the reduction of these challenges. In this regard, we systematically
   gathered, characterised and clarified the challenges, in addition to
   collecting and reflecting on ways of reducing them. This enabled us to
   design the framework which focuses on educator learning and practice in
   the improvisation of SEEMs under specified conditions. Regarding the
   implementation of the framework, we have discussed the role that
   stakeholders including professional development providers and
   researchers may play.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on preschool teachers' attitudes toward integrated
   Internet applications for professional development by a survey in
   Taiwan. The researcher developed a survey questionnaire consisting of
   five factors: usefulness, effectiveness, behavioral intention, Internet
   connection, and professional competence. This study analyzed the survey
   data from Taiwan's preschool teachers' attitudes through structural
   equation modeling. The findings show that preschool teachers feel
   positively toward Internet innovative value to improve their pedagogical
   practices. Their considerations on usefulness, effectiveness, and
   behavioral intention using the Internet positively influence their
   attitudes toward Internet-based professional interactions and abilities.
   The researcher discussed certain implications of the findings. An
   enhanced understanding of teacher views toward Internet applications in
   preschools provides Internet-related implementation and references for
   innovations and high-quality early childhood professional development.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine enablers and barriers to the
   technology integration into education based on the example of the
   situation at the Kyrgyz-Turkish Manas University as reported by students
   and instructors. The study employed the mixed-methods research design,
   combining data obtained from 477 student and 57 instructor
   questionnaires supplemented by interviews with 11 students and 9
   instructors. The study revealed that although technology is being used
   at the universities all over the country, there still exists the lack of
   both hardware and software laboratories and the instructors have limited
   knowledge and experience with technology, which, in its turn, indicates
   the shortage of qualified technical personnel. The cost of personal
   computers and problems with the Internet connection were claimed to be
   the major barriers for students.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates the effects that Facebook-based online
   peer assessment with micro-teaching videos can have on attitudes toward
   peer assessment and perceived learning from peer assessment. The study
   recruited a sample of 31 university students who were enrolled in a
   teacher-training course. Using assessees' microteaching videos, the
   experimental group performed two rounds of online peer assessments
   targeting teacher performance; by comparison, the control group
   performed two identical rounds of peer assessment, but without the
   assessees' microteaching videos. The results show that the two groups
   experienced significantly positive changes in attitudes toward peer
   assessment over time. Moreover, the experimental group's perceived
   learning about teaching competency was lower than the control group's
   after completing the first-round peer assessment, but significantly
   increased over time. Finally, the open-ended responses show that
   participants regarded Facebook as a convenient tool for performing peer
   assessments, but voiced their concerns about Facebook's open and
   non-anonymous features.},

Abstract = {This study designs and implements an adaptive learning management system
   based on Felder and Silverman's Learning Style Model and the Mashup
   technology. In this system, Felder and Silverman's Learning Style model
   is used to assess students' learning styles, in order to provide
   adaptive learning to leverage learners' learning preferences.
   Additionally, this learning system also allows learners to use a Mashup
   search engine to search for related supplementary learning materials for
   better learning outcomes. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the developed adaptive learning management system. A
   questionnaire is also circulated to collect data for qualitative and
   quantitative analysis of the usability of the developed system. The
   results show that the system significantly improves learning outcomes
   and the usability is also well-accepted by the participants.},

Abstract = {In this qualitative study the researchers explored children's
   perceptions of their participation in a science class in which an
   elementary science curriculum, the Full Option Science System (FOSS),
   was combined with an innovative teaching model, Real Engagement in
   Active Problem Solving (REAPS). The children were capable of
   articulating views about their learning experiences during science
   classes. Meaningful experiences with deep levels of engagement were
   those that involved hands-on activities, such as experiments, provided
   by the FOSS curriculum; and problem-solving and model building, which
   were components of the model REAPS. Students' perceptions demonstrated
   in their drawings were similar to their interviews, which were evidence
   of their meaningful science learning experiences. Incorporating
   students' voices, as a type of feedback for teaching and learning, is
   important for teachers and practitioners; innovative pedagogical models
   contribute to meaningful and long-lasting science learning.},

Abstract = {Pre-service secondary mathematics teachers' (PSMTs) understanding and
   ability of constructing a proof is not only important for their own
   learning process, but also important for these PSMTs to help their
   future students learn how to do proofs. Therefore, this study is focused
   on and explains PSMTs' behaviors that they revealed throughout the
   proving process of a proposition. In this qualitative case study, the
   participants were fifteen volunteer PSMTs from a public university in
   Turkey. The participants were given a proposition which they were asked
   to think aloud and prove it on the blackboard. The findings of this
   study show that PSMTs' behaviors and thoughts regarding the given
   proposition were limited. In detail, PSMTs had difficulties in
   application of mathematical language and notations, understanding the
   meaning of the given proposition, knowing where to get started on a
   proof, using examples efficiently, using appropriate and efficient
   methods to construct the proof, and defining logical structures of the
   proposition to construct the proof.},

Abstract = {The nature of mathematics teachers' knowledge specific to teaching
   mathematics {[}MTK] is of ongoing concern in mathematics education
   research. This article contributes to our under-standing of this
   knowledge with particular focus on reflective awareness. It discusses
   MTK based on ways it has been used in research. It highlights reflective
   awareness as a central aspect of MTK based on a study of elementary
   school mathematics teachers' learning and teaching associated with a
   self-directed professional development initiative to transform their
   teaching to an inquiry-based perspective. Research questions focused on
   how this initiative supported reflective awareness in the teachers'
   learning and teaching. Findings indicated that engaging in self-based
   and meaning-based questioning and creating pedagogical models were
   central to the teachers' learning and use of reflective awareness. Their
   knowledge of reflective awareness as a way of knowing was important to
   their development of an inquiry stance and knowledge of mathematics for
   teaching and mathematics pedagogy.},

Abstract = {Problem solving is an indispensable part of engineering. Improving
   critical thinking dispositions for solving engineering problems is one
   of the objectives of engineering education. In this sense, knowing
   critical thinking and problem solving skills of engineering students is
   of importance for engineering education. This study aims to determine
   the critical thinking dispositions and the problem solving skills of
   computer engineering students as well as the relationship between them.
   The study was conducted in a university located in the north of Turkey
   at the beginning of the 2013-2014 spring semester. The research sample
   consisted of 186 students attending the faculty of engineering
   department of computer engineering. The California Critical Thinking
   Dispositions Inventory (CCTDI) and the Problem Solving Inventory (PSI)
   were used for data collection. The descriptive survey model was
   employed. The data obtained in the study were analyzed via the
   independent t-test, the Mann Whitney U-test, the Kruskal-Wallis test,
   and the Pearson's Correlation coefficient. The research results
   indicated that the students had high-level critical thinking
   dispositions and problem solving skills. Critical thinking disposition
   levels of the students did not vary statistically significantly by
   gender and grade. Similarly, no statistically significant variation was
   observed in the problem solving skill levels of the students by gender
   and grade. In addition, a statistically significant relationship was
   found between the critical thinking dispositions and the problem solving
   skills of students, but it was a low-level relationship.},
