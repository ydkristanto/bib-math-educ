Abstract = {The study, which is derived from a larger study, compares grades 10 - 12
   mathematics learners' non-routine problem solving. An exploratory study
   was conducted on a convenience sample drawn from three high performing
   high schools located in Tshwane North District, Gauteng province of
   South Africa. Learners wrote a non-routine problem solving test.
   Findings revealed that the 11th grade learners obtained the highest mean
   score while that of the 10th grade learners was the lowest. High school
   learners' level of strategy use on solving non-routine problems improved
   significantly as they progress from grade 10 to higher grades. No
   significant difference was discovered as learners progress from grade 11
   to 12.},

Abstract = {Many researchers claim that inquiry-based learning offers proper
   solutions to engage students in the 3D virtual world (3DVW), while
   little literature has reported how to conduct inquiry-based learning and
   to what extent it influences learning in this world. This study
   investigates the perceived effectiveness when students exhibit in the
   inquiry-based learning compared with the standard learning in the 3DVW.
   Forty-eight students voluntarily participate in the experiment. Half of
   them learn in the inquiry-based environment, and the other half learn in
   the standard environment. The effectiveness is measured by the perceived
   experience and perceived knowledge gains. The data is analyzed by
   combining the quantitative with qualitative approaches. The results show
   students who exhibit in the inquiry-based environment perceive more
   effectiveness than those who don't. Also, the reasons why students
   perceive in the way are obtained. This study indicates the inquiry-based
   learning conducted in the 3DVW can effectively enhance learning.},

Abstract = {The study investigates learning spillovers from local firms as well as
   MNEs in China, and their indirect effects on other firms' exporting,
   paying particular attention to inter- and intra-industry spillovers. We
   develop a synthetic model based on the treatment of spillovers in
   economics, geography and international business, testing four different
   spillover effects, measured by export propensity and intensity of local
   Chinese firms associated with four types of export agglomeration. We
   find significant, positive spillovers effects. Surprisingly, spillovers
   transmitted from locally-owned exporters to local firms turn out to be
   stronger than those from foreign-owned exporters to local firms.
   Unsurprisingly, spillovers transmitted within the same industry are
   stronger than with different industries. The evidence suggests that
   after 30 years of openness to international trade and export-oriented
   development, China's indigenous firms have started to make a significant
   contribution to the export performance of other local firms. This
   finding is different from findings from previous empirical analysis,
   which reveals that maybe there's a diminishing teaching effects from
   foreign MNEs to local firms.},

Abstract = {New information technology (new IT) plays an increasingly important role
   in the field of education, which greatly enriches the teaching means and
   promotes the sharing of education resources. However, because of the New
   Digital Divide existing, the impact of new IT on educational equality
   has yet to be discussed. Based on Information System Success Model
   (ISSM), this research introduces the user's ability access, including
   skills ability access and usage ability access, to explain the
   relationship between the new IT application and educational equality,
   and has carried on the empirical test using PLS-SEM statistical analysis
   techniques. The results show that the system quality, information
   quality and service quality of new IT would directly affect the user's
   ability access, further affect user's intention to use and user's
   satisfaction, and then influence the realization of educational
   equality.},

Abstract = {A visual representation involves delivering messages through visually
   communicated images. The study assumed that semantic recognition can
   affect visual interpretation ability, and the result showed that
   students graduating from a general high school achieve satisfactory
   results in semantic recognition and image interpretation tasks than
   students graduating from a vocational high school. Twenty students with
   low semantic recognition performance participated in our study and
   completed 24 hours of an intensive Chinese semantics-training course
   after the design foundation course. The results revealed that the
   Chinese intensive training improved their semantic recognition in design
   performance, thereby is confirming the assumption. Our study results
   suggest that design teachers must not only provide strong practical
   design training, but also develop skills such as semantic comprehension
   and object interpretation in young designers.},

Abstract = {In the present article, the context-dependency of student reasoning is
   studied in a context of optics. We investigated introductory students'
   explanations about the behavior of light when different light sources,
   namely a small light bulb and a laser, were used in otherwise identical
   task assignments. The data was gathered with the aid of pretest and
   post-test questions and semi-structured interviews. According to the
   results, the different light sources triggered different sets of
   students' ideas about light and its behavior. The students' ideas
   corresponded to the perceptible features of the light sources, and
   textbook presentations used at the earlier levels of education. The use
   of the ideas hindered students' abilities to apply the scientific models
   of light in a coherent manner. Overall the present study suggests that
   students' difficulties in understanding the behavior of light are partly
   caused by their ideas about light sources commonly labeled in the task
   assignments of optics.},

Abstract = {This article probes teacher responses to three curricular reform
   initiatives from a South African situated contextual perspective. It
   focuses on Life Sciences teachers who have initially reported feeling
   overwhelmed by this rapidly changing curriculum environment: adopting
   and re-adapting to the many expected shifts. The research question posed
   is: How do teachers negotiate and reinterpret their professional roles
   and responsibilities in the continually changing environment? A
   qualitative research design engaged dialogically with 8 Life Science
   teachers from moderately resourced schools located North of Durban
   generating insights that were central to their shifting agency of their
   teacher professional development (TPD). Our findings show these LS
   teachers are resilient to the changing curriculum times; their
   collegiality and agentic actions allows for divisions of labour,
   sustainable ties and strategies for walking the talk. The article
   concludes by discussing whether these agentic forms of TPD can be
   generated across differing contexts that are less well-enabled. When
   productive TPD voice is not activated, curriculum reform paradoxically
   contributes to (re) producing the existing inequities of context.},

Abstract = {The usage of medical resources can meet required overall medial quality
   via the implementation of knowledge managements. At the same time, it
   allows medical professionals to understand and recognize the management
   strategy of the hospital. They will stay with the hospital and assist it
   in keeping its competitiveness and the goal of sustainable operations.
   Therefore, it is an important topic for hospital managements nowadays to
   realize this goal. Based on this consideration, the objective of this
   study is to investigate the influence of knowledge management on
   organizational culture and organizational effectiveness. The sampled
   subjects in this study include doctors and medical professionals in the
   city-level Grade III Level I hospital in Shanghai City. A total of 376
   questionnaire copies were dispatched and a total of 266 copies were
   returned with an effective rate of response as 71\%. The results of this
   study indicated the following findings. 1. There is a significantly
   positive correlation between knowledge management and organizational
   culture. 2. There is significantly positive correlation between
   organizational culture and organizational performance. 3. There is a
   significantly positive correlation between knowledge management and
   organizational performance. 4. The organizational culture has a
   mediation effect between knowledge management and organizational
   effectiveness. At the final stage of this study, we proposed our
   recommendations for the health care industry with an expectation that
   these could serve as the direction for stipulating health care policies
   in the future and a reference for the design of medical professional's
   works, personnel incentive managements, and in-service trainings.
   Embodied recommendations were also proposed for the health care industry
   to promote knowledge management and the practical implementation of
   strategies.},

Title = {Exploring Indigenous Game-based Physics Activities in Pre-Service
   Physics Teachers' Conceptual Change and Transformation of Epistemic
   Beliefs},
Journal = {EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION},

Volume = {13},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Laro-ng-Lahi (Indigenous Filipino game) based physics activities
   invigorated the integration of culture in the pre-service physics
   education to develop students' epistemic beliefs and the notion of
   conceptual understanding through conceptual change. The study
   conveniently involved 28 pre-service undergraduate physics students
   enrolled in an introductory physics course in a Philippine university.
   Context-culture-based framework dictated how the traditional Filipino
   games blend with Newtonian concept formation to motivate conditions and
   conceptual ecology for conceptual change to occur. These physics
   activities conducted by the participants in each session directed their
   explicit learning of Mechanics concepts. Pre-post-test design using the
   Force Concept Inventory and Epistemological Beliefs Assessment for
   Physical Science detected the participants' conceptual change and
   epistemic beliefs improvement respectively. Qualitative data from
   student interviews and journal insights supplemented the quantitative
   data. Results showed that these physics activities indicated significant
   change in the students' conception interpreted as conceptual change. The
   study also indicated incremental development of epistemic beliefs,
   however, the progress observed was not statistically significant.
   Consequently, it is recommended that sustained and prolonged exposure of
   pre-service undergraduate physics students to culture-influenced
   instructional designs may lead to eventually developing sophisticated
   epistemic belief systems consequently providing better teaching and
   learning framework and service for quality education.},

Abstract = {In this study we explored whether the use of teachers' demonstrations
   significantly improves students' understanding of redox reactions
   compared with control group counterparts who were not exposed to the
   demonstrations. The sample consisted of 131 Israeli 8th graders in
   middle schools (junior high school). Students' attitudes and
   achievements as well as their understanding of redox and electrolysis
   were assessed by administering a questionnaire that investigated their
   attitudes (perceptions) towards a demonstration in chemistry. The
   findings showed that the experimental group's achievements and
   understanding of the subject were statistically significantly better
   than those of their control group counterparts.},

Abstract = {This study aims to identify the level of knowledge and practice on the
   implementation of higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) among mathematics
   teachers at a secondary school in the district of Terengganu. The study
   focused on the aspects of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment and
   compared them with demographic factors of the respondents. It used the
   quantitative approach and adopted descriptive survey method involving
   196 respondents. Also, inferential analysis was conducted using Pearson
   correlation and Multivariate Analysis of Variance Test (MANOVA). The
   findings showed that the level of knowledge and practice of the
   assessment aspect was the weakest. Also, there was a relationship
   between the level of knowledge and practice of HOTS in each aspect.
   Significant differences exist in the level of knowledge and practice in
   the implementation of HOTS based on demographic factors such as gender,
   the location of school and exposure in the HOTS course.},

Abstract = {The popularity of the Internet has toppled people's thinking models and
   teaching styles as well as influenced the operation of school education.
   In teaching processes, computers could attract students' attention
   through vivid images, bright colors and characters, and sound to further
   promote their learning concentration and interests. Research on the
   application of integrating information into instruction is increasing,
   and lots of studies prove that technology could help students' learning
   and improve their learning attitudes. In this study, the nonequivalent
   pretest posttest control group design is utilized for the
   quasi-experiment research. Total 236 students in two classes each from
   Xiamen University and Fuzhou University in Fujian Province are selected
   as the research objects for the 32week experimental instruction for 3
   hours per week (total 96 hours). The research results reveal 1.
   significant effects of adventure education on comprehension, 2.
   remarkable effects of adventure education on learning effectiveness, 3.
   the best promotion of comprehension with Reciprocal Teaching under
   multimedia teaching, and 4. the best promotion of learning effectiveness
   with Reciprocal Teaching under multimedia teaching. The results are
   further discussed to propose specific suggestions in this study. It is
   expected to enhance teachers' teaching skills and promote students'
   learning effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The major purpose of this study is to develop an architectural design
   knowledge management learning system with corresponding learning
   activities to help the students have meaningful learning and improve
   their design capability in their learning process. Firstly, the system
   can help the students to obtain and share useful knowledge. Secondly,
   through extraction, application and creation as well as corresponding
   learning activities, the students can achieve meaningful learning.
   Lastly, the system can enable the students to accumulate knowledge and
   experiences to build their schema automatically and improve their design
   capability. The technology acceptance model (TAM) analysis results
   support all the hypotheses of this study, indicating the perceived
   usefulness and ease of use of the system have a positive influence on
   the students' willingness to use the system, which also helps to
   effectively reduce the problem of cognitive overload of the student in
   their learning process and then improve their design capability.},

Abstract = {Flexibility in transforming algebraic expressions is recognized as
   fundamental for a rich procedural knowledge. Here, flexibility in-depth
   is proposed as the ability to apply one strategy to a wide range of
   unfamiliar expressions. In this study, design experiments with four
   groups of students were conducted to support students' flexibility
   in-depth in regard to the application of the distributive law with the
   help of worked examples. The data from these experiments was analyzed
   qualitatively with the method of content analysis. Students' flexibility
   in-depth translates into their abilities to reconstruct the distributive
   property within an expression via its perceived relevant structural
   features. The students' use individual cornerstones for this
   reconstruction, for example worked examples or certain focal points in
   an expression like the multiplication sign. Transforming expressions and
   especially applying formulas to algebraic expressions is thus an
   interpretative and reconstructive process.},

Abstract = {The study explored the effect of cooperative learning on Grade 12
   learners' performance in projectile motions. A quasi-experimental
   research design with non-equivalent control group was used. Two schools
   were purposively selected from Maleboho Central circuit in South Africa
   based on their performance in Physical Sciences Grade 12 results of
   2011. The sample consisted of 49 learners from two schools. School A was
   used as the Experimental Group (EG) and was taught using cooperative
   learning technique while school B was the Control Group (CG) taught
   using traditional teaching methods. Pre- and post-tests were used to
   collect data. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics:
   arithmetic means and standard deviations; and inferential statistics:
   independent student t-test, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and Cohen's
   d. Results show that EG outperformed the CG suggesting that cooperative
   learning technique enhanced learners' performance more than the
   traditional talk-and-chalk teaching approach.},

Abstract = {This study makes an important contribution to an expanding body of
   international comparative studies by exploring factors predicting
   differences in science and mathematics achievement by students in Turkey
   and the Republic of Korea on the 2011 TIMSS assessment. While these
   countries are similar with regards to population size, cultural beliefs
   about education, and public expenditure on education, students in each
   country have different levels of achievement in science and mathematics.
   The current research investigated how aptitude, instruction, and
   environment related factors predict Turkish and Korean students'
   achievement in science and mathematics. In both countries, some factors,
   such as student aptitude (e.g., science self-efficacy) and environmental
   (e.g., parental educational level) factors significantly predicted
   students' science and mathematics achievement. However, we found some
   differences between the two countries regarding certain classroom
   environmental variables, such as bullying and student sense of belonging
   at school. We discuss educational implications for these findings.},

Abstract = {In addition to the rapidly developed Internet information technology,
   the admission to secondary schools has changed from single entry to
   multiple entries, among which the performance of Basic Competence Test
   and at schools have replaced Joint University Programs Admissions
   System. Traditional instruction therefore could no longer cope with such
   rapidly changing educational environments that the instructional design
   and methods need to be largely updated in order to keep up with the
   demand of multiple entries. A teacher should thoroughly utilize
   computers and the Internet resources in the instruction for enhancing
   the teaching effect.
   Students in Shanghai Open University are sampled for the questionnaire
   survey in this study. Total 500 copies of questionnaires are
   distributed. Having deducted invalid and incomplete ones, 344 copies are
   valid, with effective retrieval rate 69\%. The results are summarized as
   below. 1. Mobile learning perception presents significantly positive
   correlations with study habits. 2. Study habits reveal remarkably
   positive correlations with continuous learning. 3. Mobile learning
   perception shows notably positive correlations with continuous learning.
   4. Study habits appear mediation effects on the correlation between
   mobile learning perception and continuous learning. According to above
   results, suggestions are proposed in this study for the service or
   establishment of education contents, expecting to further help learners
   acquire knowledge.},

Abstract = {When ``The Maker Movement{''} started, it made a great impact and
   influence on many aspects of society. The Maker Movement has transformed
   industries as well as people's way of life and thinking. For this
   reason, many people decided to create something by turning their ideas
   to tangible products. Media has become a bridge that connects people to
   each other and to reality. It is also a tool which controls
   relationships. ``Efficiency{''} has been replaced by creativity based on
   the economic market model, and creativity links up with capitalism. The
   aim of this article is to establish a ``creative
   production-manufacturing{''} process based on ``The Maker Movement{''}
   context along with the relationship between ``media-as-tools{''} and
   ``creative production-manufacturing{''}. The article also discusses how
   the media impact the ``creative production-manufacturing{''} process as
   tools. Lastly, it presents the possibilities of interaction between a
   ``creative production-manufacturing{''} model and design education.},

Abstract = {The study has sought answers to two major questions: What is the current
   situation in Elementary Mathematics Education programs at Faculty of
   Education in terms of classroom teaching competencies? To what extent do
   pre service teachers acquire these competencies? The research was
   conducted on 202 senior pre service teachers studying at the Department
   of Elementary Mathematics Education at a State University in Turkey
   during the 2012-2013 academic years. An observation form developed by
   the researcher was used to collect data about the pre service teachers'
   classroom competencies. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
   The findings indicated a significant and positive relationship between
   the sub dimensions of pre service teachers' teaching competencies. In
   addition, there was a significant difference between competency score in

Abstract = {This study employed a print laboratory material based on 5E model of
   constructivist learning approach to teach reflection of light and Image
   on a Plane Mirror. The effect of the instruction which conducted with
   the designed print laboratory material on academic achievements of
   prospective science and technology teachers and their attitudes towards
   physics laboratory was questioned. The study was carried out with 98
   prospective teachers who attended the course named General Physics
   Laboratory III and undergraduate students at the Department of Science
   Education at Karadeniz Technical University during 2011-2012 fall
   semesters. The study was conducted by adopting semi-experimental method.
   Experimental group instructed with the designed print laboratory
   material whereas control group instructed in through traditional
   laboratory practices. The Achievement Test, Physics Laboratory Attitude
   Scale, and Reflective Writings were used as data collection tools. It
   was proved that the instruction carried out with print laboratory
   materials based on 5E model contributed to academic achievements of
   prospective teachers and their attitudes towards physics laboratory more
   than the instruction based on traditional approach. Based on the
   research results, it was recommended that print materials prepared based
   on the constructivist learning theory could be generalized in the
   Physics Laboratory courses.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of a
   Standards-based elementary mathematics curriculum on third grade
   students' mathematics performance. A total of 707 students participated
   in this study. Of this total, 368 students were from eight schools
   located within the same school district in a racially and ethnically
   diverse large city in the Midwest. Another 339 of the students were from
   four schools located in two different school districts in a middle- to
   high-SES, largely white, suburban area in the Northeast. Third grade
   students using Investigations curriculum outperformed in most cases and
   performed the same in the other cases matched comparison groups who were
   using a range of conventional curricula on the mathematics assessment.
   The Investigations groups did the same or better on the
   decontextualized, contextualized, and algebraic-reasoning constellations
   compared with their counterparts. The revised Investigations curriculum
   was not as effective with the low SES African-American students as it
   was for middle to high SES, white students. The curriculum fidelity
   measures did not differentiate achievement differences.},

Abstract = {Summer vacations interrupt the rhythm of learning and may result in a
   loss of knowledge and skills. This study investigates summer learning
   losses in an Austrian sample with nine-week summer vacations. The
   results show losses as well as gains for students in lower secondary
   education (182 students between 10 and 12 years old). Students
   experienced losses in arithmetic problem solving (measured by the HAWIK
   IV intelligence test) and spelling (measured by the standardized
   spelling test HSP 5-9), but gains in reading (measured by the Salzburg
   Reading-Screening, SLS-8). Losses or gains in a knowledge domain appear
   to depend on the degree of practice during the summer vacation. Contrary
   to American studies, students could make up for their losses within nine
   weeks following the re-start of school. In addition, socio-economic
   variables such as the mother's educational background had a small impact
   on summer learning losses in arithmetic problem solving.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop an instructional design model for
   science laboratory instruction. Well-known ID models were analysed and
   Dick and Carey model was imitated to produce a science laboratory
   instructional design (SLID) model. In order to validate the usability of
   the designed model, the views of 34 high school teachers related to
   SLID's steps were gathered via a survey. The survey results on the basis
   of necessity of SLID's elements showed that the mean of the items was
   extremely high. Statistical analysis on teachers' views about SLID
   across teachers' gender, subject and school type resulted in no
   differences. The outcome of this study, that is SLID, is expected to
   enhance the process of teaching and learning science in laboratory
   setting.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate three second-year graduate
   students' awareness and understanding of the relationships among the
   ``big ideas{''} that underlie the concept of derivative through modeling
   tasks and Skemp's distinction between relational and instrumental
   understanding. The modeling tasks consisting of warm-up,
   model-eliciting, and model-exploration activities were used to stimulate
   participants to reflect and construct ideas about the concept of change.
   The data indicated that the participants' understanding of derivative
   was rather instrumental. Their explanations couldn't reveal the role of
   the big ideas regarding the concept of derivative with respect to what
   they mean, why and how they are related to the derivative and to each
   other. The results highlighted the fact that even if one of big ideas is
   ignored, the concept of derivative may not be fully understood
   relationally due to the compartmentalization of these big ideas in
   students' conceptual systems. If this happens to be the case, even
   though students can solve differentiation tasks/problems correctly,
   which implies procedural understanding, they may not be actually making
   sense of what the concept of derivative conceptually means.},

Abstract = {Biotechnology has been widely applied in various products throughout the
   21st century. Malaysia selected the biotechnology sector as one of the
   key strategic technologies that would enable Malaysia to transform into
   a fully developed nation by the year 2020. However, to date, there has
   been very little research on the level of biotechnology literacy amongst
   school students in Malaysia and the aim of this study is to determine
   the presence of biotechnology literacy, based on knowledge, perception,
   and attitude. Besides, this study also determines the factors affecting
   the students' attitude towards biotechnology. This study is a
   quantitative study involving 292 secondary school students from science
   and non-science classes. The findings showed that overall students have
   what we describe as a medium level of knowledge, perception, and
   attitude towards biotechnology. It is anticipated that this pattern of
   findings can help teachers, the Ministry of Education and the media to
   strategically plan ahead so that improvements in the national curriculum
   can be proposed and implemented.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of solution methods
   and question prompts on generalization and justification of non-routine
   problem solving for Grade 9 students. The learning activities are based
   on the context of the frog jumping game. In addition, related computer
   tools were used to support generalization and justification of
   non-routine problem solving. Non-equivalent pretest/posttest quasi
   experimental design was adopted in this study. The experimental results
   are summarized as follows: (1) generalization and justification
   performance of non-routine problem solving for students in the specific
   prompt group is significantly better than that for students in the
   general prompt group, and (2) generalization and justification
   performance of non-routine problem solving for students in the
   multiple-solution group is significantly better than that for students
   in the single-solution group. Finally, suggestions were proposed based
   on the results found in this study, which may serve as useful directions
   for teachers and future studies.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a trend study investigating what
   students associate with the term radiation and what ideas they have
   about this topic. The first part of the interview study was conducted in
   June 2010 and its results were reported in a previously published
   article (Neumann \& Hopf, 2012). Two years later (June 2012, 15 months
   after the Fukushima accident), the study was replicated under similar
   preconditions in order to get an impression about a possible shift in
   the changes of students' ideas. One result of our comparison study was
   that, compared to the students interviewed in 2010, a significantly
   higher percentage of students exclusively associated nuclear radiation
   with the term radiation and their emotions towards the topic were more
   negative.},

Abstract = {Animal dissections are essential parts of anatomy/zoology courses, but
   their effectiveness is influenced by student attitudes and emotions.
   Here we examined attitudes toward dissections in 397 prospective biology
   teachers enrolling two Slovak universities. Perceived disgust of
   dissections negatively correlated with other attitudes toward
   dissections domains and previous experiences with dissections correlated
   positively with attitudes toward dissections. Reported experiences with
   real and virtual dissections in Slovak elementary and high schools were
   rare. Students who owned animal(s) at home had less positive attitudes
   toward dissections than non-animal owners. Our research support an idea
   that prior experiences with dissections and low perceived disgust
   correlate with positive attitudes toward dissections. Special attention
   should be dedicated to females and to animal owners, because positive
   attitudes toward animals may be in conflict with supportive attitudes
   towards dissections.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine mathematics teachers' concerns
   about the sixth grade curriculum that was launched in Turkey in 2006. As
   a data collection tool, the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ),
   based on the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM), was administered
   twice (at the beginning and the end of the instructional year) to 110
   teachers who were using the new mathematics curriculum for the first
   time. The same teachers were also asked to provide an open-ended
   statement in order to obtain qualitative data. The data were analyzed
   separately to highlight changes in the teachers' concerns about the 6th
   grade curriculum. According to the results, the teachers were mainly
   concerned about becoming sufficiently informed about the program;
   organization and timing issues; inadequate school conditions and
   students' backgrounds. They were also concerned about the new
   instructional materials, although the intensity of their concerns
   changed over time.},

Abstract = {Mathematics, being the core subject that has its application in every
   other subject should be given special attention. Despite the importance
   of mathematics, students are not performing in the subject. Students
   view mathematics in abstract form. Ways of improving the teaching and
   learning of mathematics should be the concern of the stakeholders. A lot
   of research work were reported on teaching strategies, but the problem
   of poor performance has not been reduced to minimal level. Students
   thinking and error made in class can be used to create teachable
   moments. This study investigated whether the teachers of mathematics in
   Nigeria are aware, managing and using teachable moments when occur in
   mathematics class. The study is a descriptive research of the survey
   type. The sample consisted of 98 mathematics teachers randomly selected
   from thirty secondary schools from both Lagos and Oyo states of Nigeria.
   A researcher-designed of effective management of Teachable Moments which
   consists of 3 parts was used to collect data from the respondents. The
   first section of the questionnaire was used to elicit general
   information on teachers' demographical data. The 3 parts of the second
   section include awareness of teachable moment (ATM), Management of
   Teachable Moment with resources (MTM) and Use of Teachable Moments
   (UTM). All instruments were validated. The reliability coefficient of
   ATM, MTM and UTM using Cronbach alpha were 0.72, 0.78 and 0.69
   respectively. Means and standard deviation were used to analyze the
   data. It was discovered that the means of the awareness and management
   instruments were greater than the baseline mean (2.5). Teachers are
   aware, can manage but are not using the moments due to time constraint.
   This indicated that mathematics teachers in Nigeria are aware of
   teachable moments, managing the moments effectively but have not been
   using teachable moments.},

Abstract = {The learning model of michelson morlay has a significant effect on the
   improvement of students' mathematical cognitive learning outcomes. This
   quasi-experimental research aimed to reveal differences in students'
   cognitive learning outcomes between experimental and conventional
   classes. Limited information related to the MM model and playing cards
   in integer matter mathematics learning encouraged this research to be
   conducted. MM model is one of the latest models or inventions that have
   not been developed. MM research instrument developed in the form of a
   description and validated by a mathematician before the research done.
   The results revealed that, there was no difference in pretest score
   between students who experienced conventional learning and MM. The
   T-test results were also revealed that the posttest of students studying
   with MM equipped with higher playing cards when compared with
   conventional class. The findings of this study suggest that it is
   important for teachers to empower students' cognitive abilities through
   MM and games in order to make learning more meaningful and contextual.
   Thus the MM learning model can be recommended in developing and
   improving students' cognitive learning outcome mathematics. Future
   research will explore the effect of MM on emotional intelligence,
   critical thinking of students and other variables related to mathematics
   learning.},

   use. The results of the research showed that there was a significant
   difference in the critical thinking skills between the experimental
   class and the control class. The result of critical thinking skills of
   the students in the inquiry discovery class was higher than that of the
   conventional learning class. The research recommends that teachers
   empower HOTS ability of the students in the inquiry-discovery class, so
   that a meaningful learning and student-centered learning can be created.
   Future researches are needed to explore the contribution of
   inquiry-discovery model on students' critical thinking skills.},

Abstract = {This study examines the growth of an innovative pre-service science
   teachers' (PST) community over a period of three years in a voluntary
   and informal setting for teaching science to high school students. The
   objective of this study is to understand the traits and conditions
   necessary for the learning and development that occurred in the PST
   group. We describe the growth of the PST group with a focus on the
   group's endeavor to move from simple laboratory work to a more
   inquiry-based approach to science instruction. In doing so, we seek to
   articulate the growth of the group by focusing through the lens of
   cultural historical activity theory on how its meanings, tools, and
   priorities were constantly formulated and examined within the community.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to learn the perceptions of social media
   users regarding multicultural education in Turkey. With this goal in
   mind, a short film was created that summarized the issue of
   multicultural education, which was shared via social media. After
   viewing the film, the views of the participants who had expressed
   comments concerning multicultural education were taken for evaluation,
   and 95.65\% of participants harbored positive perceptions about
   multicultural education. Furthermore, the collected data were analyzed
   employing a thematic analytical method. The themes found were:
   alienation, social justice and equality, empathy and tolerance and
   cultural diversity and difference. On examining the results, it emerged
   that participants thought that, because multicultural education,
   discrimination, injustice and alienation would disappear and increased
   empathy, tolerance and justice would emerge.},

   of students, who are in the last phase of their adolescence period. This
   scale that developed to identify the communicative effectiveness levels
   of adolescent science students in their friendships has been introduced
   as there is no other scientific scale in the literature. The scale was
   finalised with statistical analyses after administration to 504 students
   studied in the year of 2016-17. The final version of the scale has an
   internal consistency coefficient of .853 and a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO)
   value of 0.738. The scale consists of 37 items with a 5 point Likert

Abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology and global
   popularization of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology, the
   original teaching methods of engineering project management can no
   longer meet the needs of the times. Therefore, it is timely to propose
   innovative teaching reform programs. This article combines the new
   construction engineering technology with the Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) involving the visual simulation method, and introduces
   them into the teaching programs. The curriculum system design,
   curriculum content, the method of teaching, and the form of examination,
   etc., are determined mainly by analyzing the practice and application of
   BIM technology both at home and abroad, this analysis and practice is
   done in teaching reform, extensively making curriculum reform research
   and consulting expert opinions. These are in accordance with the current
   social reality and graduate employment direction. It explores the
   teaching reform methods of the course to achieve the purpose of making
   students understand and learn the course more intuitively and vividly
   and also to master project management theory and practical skills.},

   advantages on which high-Tech Industry used to depend for the
   development are disappearing. The value of high-Tech Industry no longer
   depends on the possession of plants, equipment, and products, but on the
   intellectual property, customer confidence, and teamwork ability of
   business partners, infrastructure of telecommunications, and employees'
   creative potential and skills. How to construct the environment climate,
   in high-Tech Industry, for employees being happy to work, creating
   knowledge, learning, communicating and sharing as well as to guide
   employees' goals being consistent with organizational objectives to
   continuously contribute to the organization is the motivation of this
   study. Aiming at supervisors and employees of manufacturers in Weihai
   Torch Hi-Tech Science Park in Shandong Province, total 500 copies of
   questionnaire are distributed in this study. 376 valid copies are
   retrieved, with the retrieval rate 75\%. The research results conclude
   that 1. learning organization presents positive and significant effects
   on organizational communication, 2. organizational communication reveals
   positive and remarkable effects on organizational creativity, and 3.
   learning organization shows positive effects on organizational
   creativity. According to the results, conclusion and suggestion are
   proposed, expecting to help high-Tech Industry become learning
   organizations and promote organizational communication and
   organizational creativity.},

Abstract = {Design discipline can be defined as it has dynamic, technologic,
   socio-cultural features and its process changes constantly. The design
   problems in the design studio are mostly fictional; the virtual user,
   program and space become concrete by the requirement program that is
   specified according to research in this process. Although this designed
   virtual space has potential for construction, it is observed that it
   remains at conceptual format on paper and doesn't become reality. It is
   a stubborn fact that both conceptual and construction project provide
   essential contributions to design discipline and make references to
   different aspects of design. The final design artifact generated in the
   light of this information, is beyond being just the perceptions,
   opinions and technological advancements. It can be defined as the
   reflection of the existence of its designer. In this report it will be
   emphasized how is design realized, how are the concern of conceptual
   thinking, analyzing, synthesizing, evaluating and resulting processes
   attained, where is the place of intelligence in the perception of
   problems. The importance of intelligence in the solving the problems and
   the experiences of memory in this process will be represented as well.
   As a result of this the design process and studio practice can be
   recognized as an ``experimental{''} process and the developments in
   technology provide various interfaces and data. One of the purposes of
   this report is the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of
   technology in the construction phase, which is the continuation of
   cognitive process. Beside this, design as an ``interface{''} of
   susceptibility of its designer will be examined whether it reflects the
   original identities with technological advancements or not. Within the
   scope of this study, the real-physical environments perceived by an
   individual and the ``perceptional phychology of space{''} created in
   individual's mind is compared to the individual's spatial perception
   experiencing in the virtual environments. The idea of the digital space
   created by using the VR and AR virtual reality technologies have been
   researched about to what extent it might be involved with the perception
   of real human psychology in design education. The effective use of
   technological visualizing methodologies such as VR and AR will expose a
   new perspective in design education.},

Abstract = {T+0 trading system, or day trading system, which allows the investors to
   buy and sell shares in one day, is a universal trading system in
   international markets. By contrast, T+1 trading system, which is
   implemented in China's stock market, allows investors to sell shares
   which are bought today only on the next day. T+1 trading system in spot
   market is a Chinese problem left over by history, and a characteristic
   in Chinese market. Stock index futures, the financial derivatives based
   on the stock, are the products of the development of the capital market
   at certain stage. For the stock index futures are generated based on the
   stock, they must be closely related. On that basis, what's the impact of
   the Chinese special T+1 trading system in spot market on the pricing
   efficiency, market liquidity and market volatility of the stock index
   futures market? The paper adopted the method based on the agent-based
   computational finance which's different from the traditional method, and
   built the agent-based computational cross-market platform which includes
   both several stocks and stock index futures based on MASON. The paper
   simulated the experiment on the platform to look out the effect on the
   market quality of the stock index futures market when T+1 trading system
   in spot market turned into T+0 trading system, consisting mainly of the
   efficiency of price discovery, market liquidity, market volatility and
   arbitrage investors' order submission behavior. The results showed that,
   compared with the T+1 trading system in spot market, T+0 trading system
   improved the efficiency of price discovery and market liquidity of stock
   index futures market, did not raise market volatility, enhance the
   enthusiasm of arbitrage investors' order submission behavior. From the
   perspective of the stock index futures market, we believe that we should
   restore the T+0 trading system in stock market timely, so as to active
   the market and improve the efficiency of market information diffusion,
   to promote the steady and sound environment of the stock index futures
   market.},

Abstract = {In the information explosion era nowadays, various television
   advertisements are on television. However, such traditional message
   delivery is losing the efficacy to directly communicate with target
   consumers; consumers have appeared zapping behaviors as they are fed up
   with traditional advertisement. At the time, seeking other alternatives
   for effective commercial communication is important and urgent for
   traditional industry. Product placement is now a broadly applied
   alternative. Why is such marketing communication with skillful product
   placement largely utilized by companies? It is considered in traditional
   industry that product placement is comparatively inexpensive but could
   achieve high contact, reinforce memory, and create positive links with
   program characteristics. Taking Chinese general consumers of the product
   in traditional Industry as the research subject, on-site questionnaire
   distribution and collection is adopted in this study. Total 250 copies
   of questionnaire are distributed and 218 valid copies are retrieved,
   with the retrieval rate 87\%. The research results reveal 1. significant
   effects of placement marketing on product attitude, 2. remarkable
   effects of placement marketing on purchase intention, and 3. notably
   positive effects of product attitude on purchase intention. At the end,
   suggestions are proposed according to the results, expecting to assist
   domestic traditional industry in executing placement marketing.},

Abstract = {Based on the theories of the multimodal pedagogy, this article focuses
   on the evaluation of the teaching effectiveness of multimodal college
   English listening teaching and the configuration principle of its
   multimodal system. Considering the lack of empirical research on
   multimodal college English listening teaching in China, the research
   applies empirical study to compare the differences between the
   experimental group and the control group to find out the effectiveness
   of the multimodal college English listening teaching. After the one-year
   experiment, the subjects of experimental group and control group, who
   were basically similar in their English achievement and English
   listening ability before the experiment, manifest significant
   differences in both English test and English listening test. Superior
   characteristics are reflected by the experimental group received
   multimodal college English listening teaching in two test points
   compared with the control group, which proves the feasibility and
   effectiveness of the multimodal college English listening teaching
   system. Besides, the following interviews on the subject of the
   experimental group, combined with the multimodal pedagogy theories,
   provide the possible configuration to ensure an effective, dynamic and
   three-dimensional multimodal college English listening teaching system.},

Abstract = {The topicality of the research is stipulated by the challenges of
   bringing the educational content and learning materials in line with the
   needs that young translators and interpreters have entering the labour
   market in modern fast developing society. The article aims to analyze
   from students' perspective the practical value and effectiveness of the
   learning materials for language mediators' training developed on the
   basis of the new content-focused technology in comparison to learning
   materials developed within the framework of the traditional approach.
   The methodology of the research included survey based experiment as well
   as the method of statistic data processing. The experiment involved the
   students doing their master degree course on Public Service Interpreting
   and Translation (total number of the participants is 30 students). The
   experiment was conducted in several stages including two surveys: the
   entry survey focused on obtaining the students' feedback on their
   general satisfaction with traditional learning materials, students'
   assessment of the materials' effectiveness for training as well as
   identifying particular areas of professional interest and respective
   needs; the second survey elicited students' responses concerning the
   effectiveness of the proposed new materials. The research enhances the
   awareness of the specific characteristics of the public services setting
   for training lingo cultural mediators. Practical learning materials were
   worked out and implemented into practice. The correlated training of
   interpreting and translation skills was proved. Based on the results
   obtained in the course of the experiment the authors propose new content
   focused approach to developing learning materials which constitutes
   practical outcomes of the research. The article had both theoretical and
   practical value as the theoretical background and the proposed
   methodology can be applied to developing training courses on translation
   and interpreting in various professional domains.},

Abstract = {Presently, acquiring education and scientific knowledge by using
   technological means has become easier. Individuals use their mobile
   devices for exchange of information, entertainment and educational
   purposes. They meet several needs by mobile devices which have become an
   indispensable element of their lives. Mobile devices also enable
   preschool pupils to learn a foreign language more efficiently regardless
   of time and space as they are portable. Teachers, on the other hand,
   convey subjects of education and teaching to their students by using
   their mobile devices. In brief, mobile learning is one of the
   significant components of education. This research aims to establish the
   efficiency and influence of mobile learning in respect of foreign
   language learning. It involves a case study based on a qualitative
   research design. In this study where teachers take part as participants,
   the contribution of mobile learning process to the foreign language
   development of pupils in the pre-school period will be addressed. The
   study will underline the role and influence of mobile learning on
   language development, especially on foreign language education.},

Abstract = {This study provides an important contribution to the literature by
   attempting a more systematic curriculum evaluation based on
   Stufflebeam's Context, Input, Process and Product (CIPP) curriculum
   evaluation framework. It provides the first attempt at a systematic
   evaluation of the effectiveness, sustainability and impact of a recently
   introduced elective course titled Turkey in Contemporary World History
   curriculum in North Cyprus. The study developed a scale, based on the
   (CIPP) evaluation framework, and its reliability and validity were
   tested based on the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin and Bartlett Sphericity tests
   which indicated that the scale was available for factor analysis.
   Accordingly, primary data for the study was generated through a sample
   survey of 399 students in North Cyprus. Preliminary results and analysis
   reveal that, the objectives, contents, teaching-learning process and
   textbook for the TCWH course were not effective. The study concludes
   with some recommendations to enhance the effectiveness and impact of the
   course.},

Abstract = {Technological innovation and knowledge transfer are a complex process,
   facing the challenges of various obstacles, may be the impact of
   technology, organizational, economic or talent, which requires
   innovation within the main and external power drive. BIM is gradually
   applied to the entire construction industry chain, in which the
   implementation of 3D modeling design application has been deeply rooted,
   stakeholders gradually accepted the BIM throughout the construction
   project life cycle development concept. Nine percent of stakeholders
   believe that BIM implementation is important. In the process of
   technological innovation and knowledge transfer, the priority of BIM
   implementation is focused on three aspects: cost, standard and talent.
   The choice of government driving force is focused on three aspects:
   fiscal and taxation support, national standard and education and
   training.},

Abstract = {We study the factors that determine teachers' behavioral intention to
   adopt microlecture. We collect 500 survey responses across elementary
   and secondary schools in China and propose a model based on three
   previous works: Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM 3), Innovation
   Diffusion Theory and Model of Personal Computer Utilization (MPCU). Our
   results show that perceived usefulness is a significant determinant for
   teachers' attitude toward microlecture. Perceived ease of use and output
   quality significantly influence perceived usefulness, with the latter
   being more significant. Additionally, external control and computer
   self-efficacy are found to be factors that influence perceived
   usefulness. External control is a more significant contributor to
   perceived usefulness. Overall, our model accounts for 57.1\% of
   variability in teachers' intention to use microlecture. Out of 11
   formulated hypotheses, 6 are supported by the data. The results provide
   valuable implications for ways to increase teachers' acceptance of
   microlecture.},

Abstract = {Currently, informational-educational environment has become one of the
   constitutive tendencies in the development of modern education and
   correlates with IT development in all spheres of human life. The
   availability of multiple possibilities for using information and
   communication technologies in education brings about variability in
   university learning environment design. The authors propose the use of
   foresight methodology to optimize educational content and structure
   didactic potential of learning environment. The mechanism of pedagogical
   design using foresight methodology is based on accommodation of
   subjective views of stakeholders in the education system, creation of a
   common vision of the informational and educational environment which
   involves objective prognostic information and the trends and tendencies
   in regional education development. The knowledge gained from foresight
   methodology made it possible to design informational and educational, or
   learning, environment at the university that is able to ensure the
   learning process meeting the expectations of all stakeholders as close
   as it is possible and affect the employment rate of the university
   graduates.},

Abstract = {In this study, we try to reveal the mechanism of the enterprise
   competitive strategies embedded in multi-network as the intermediary
   role between the three kinds network relationships and performance, in
   order to answer such question: what kind of network relationships can
   enterprise relies on and choose a speculate competitive strategies for
   sustainable development? This research chose the Chinese animation
   enterprises as samples. We collect data from questionnaires to Guangzhou
   Animation Association and such an opportunity of the 2014 Guangzhou
   International Cartoon Festival 2014CICF) and testified the mediation
   effects of three competitive strategies between different dimensions of
   networks and firm performance. Results of this study indicated the
   mediating role of the three kinds of competitive strategies between the
   multiple network connection and performance. 1) Confrontation strategy
   has a mediating impact between inner-industry network and performance,
   so as between cross-industry network and performance. 2) Barrier
   strategy has played a mediating role between inner-industry network and
   performance, so as between government-relation network and performance.
   But barrier strategy fails to play roles between the cross-industry
   network and performance. 3) Symbiosis strategy has played an incomplete
   mediating role on the relationship between inner-industry network and
   performance, so as between government-relation network and performance.
   This study introduced the context of the dynamic competitors to promote
   the development of dynamic competition theory. Adopting the perspective
   of multi-network to the study of the dynamic competitive strategy in
   this paper is put forward to fill the gap between the dynamic
   competitive behavior and the corporate strategy.},

Abstract = {With research direction refinement and information globalization,
   knowledge economy puts forward higher requirements to high-level
   talents. University education is very important to cultivate high-level
   talents. For students of mechanical-related majors, the cultivation of
   college students' comprehensive application ability has become an
   important problem to be solved urgently. In view of current CAD
   comprehensive training of college students, environment for engineering
   reality is provided difficultly. This paper sets the development of
   ``Standard Parts Library of Rolling Bear Based on SolidWorks{''} as an
   example to illustrate that mechanical engineering students make teamwork
   and collaboration to complete the standard library research and
   development and cultivate their CAD comprehensive ability in research
   project. Through the application of practice, we find that the proposed
   training method can not only be applied to senior students, but also to
   lower grade college students, and it also creates a new educational
   model in cooperative environment.},

Abstract = {Organizational learning and knowledge management innovation are
   context-specific and they can influence SME's technological capability
   effectively. We defined knowledge management innovation as a two-stage
   process: adoption and implementation of a managerial practice, process,
   or tool that is new to the firms and is intended to enhance the firms'
   knowledge management efficiency. Then we constructed a conceptual model
   to discuss the relationship among organizational learning, knowledge
   management innovation and technological capability. We proposed that the
   effects of organizational learning were not only curvilinear but also
   differential across knowledge management innovation adoption and
   implementation process. The findings supported the hypotheses that (1)
   exploitative learning and exploratory learning had increasingly positive
   effects on knowledge management innovation; (2) knowledge management
   innovation had an inverted U relationship with technological capability;
   and (3) when exploitative learning was high, more knowledge management
   innovations were associated with better technological capability, but

Abstract = {Under the influence of big data, many fields have undergone tremendous
   changes. In the field of education, the data still contains a wealth of
   practical value, but the data mining and knowledge discovery is not
   enough, especially in the application of student evaluations of teaching
   (SET). In study, the K-means algorithm is used to cluster the data of
   three main teaching evaluation indexes (TEI) including individual
   background, course content, teaching method into high satisfaction
   degree (HSD), middle satisfaction degree (MSD), and low satisfaction
   degree (LSD). The logistic regression results showed that gender was a
   significant factor in students' evaluation of teachers and that there
   were potential connections between teaching evaluation and teachers'
   gender, age, and teaching content. In addition, the research shows that
   the effect of satisfaction degree on students' academic achievement is
   limited. The findings from this empirical study present a better
   understanding of reform of SET in higher education.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurship Education in Colleges and universities is a profound
   reform of China's higher education paradigm. Which is a necessary choice
   for Chinese universities to break through the traditional educational
   model. It is an important measure to cultivate college students'
   entrepreneurial consciousness, entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial
   ability. On the whole, entrepreneurship education in China is still in
   the stage of exploration and rapid development. It is great practical
   significance and theoretical value to clarify the relationship between
   the entrepreneurship education quality and entrepreneurial intention.
   Based on this, this paper takes the social sciences, engineering and
   science students as the research object, and empirically explores the
   relationship among the entrepreneurship education quality,
   entrepreneurial orientation, entrepreneurial self-efficacy and
   entrepreneurial intention. We find that: (1) the quality of
   entrepreneurship education will positively affect entrepreneurial
   intention, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy plays as an intermediary
   role; (2) the relationship between the quality of entrepreneurship
   education and entrepreneurial self-efficacy will be affected by the
   adjustment of entrepreneurial orientation, the stronger the level of
   entrepreneurial orientation, the stronger the positive relationship
   between the entrepreneurship education quality and entrepreneurial
   self-efficacy; (3) the stronger the level of entrepreneurial
   orientation, the stronger the mediating effect between entrepreneurial
   self-efficacy and entrepreneurial intenti.},

Abstract = {The study is relevant due to the opportunity of increasing efficiency of
   teaching mathematics at university through integration of students of
   computer experiment conducted with the use of IT in this process. The
   problem of there search is defined by a contradiction between great
   potential opportunities of mathematics experiment for motivating and
   developing modern scientific world outlook of students and beliefs about
   general methodology of cognition and between the lack of methodology for
   its implementation for teaching mathematics at university. The aim of
   the research is to explore methodological potential of computer
   experiment for improving the quality of teaching mathematics at
   university and to develop an appropriate methodology. The article
   describes student activities that allow using computer experiment for
   formation of individual research skills and skills of working with
   modern tools for solving theoretical and practical problems and presents
   methodology of studying certain sections of mathematical analysis
   including setting up problems that require experimental research of
   mathematical objects and their properties. The article may be used for
   content design of mathematics courses for raising motivation,
   preliminary studies of abstract notions, such as limit of a sequence and
   continuity, and organization of in-class, individual and research work
   of students aimed at exploring ways of scientific cognition and
   corresponding information technologies.},

Abstract = {Research in era of data representation to contribute and improve key
   data policy involving the assessment of learning, training and English
   language competency. Students are required to communicate in English
   with high level impact using language and influence. The electronic
   technology works to assess students' questions positively enabling
   semantics and intelligence in the field concerning education and health.
   Assessing the importance and complexity of the statement used in a query
   can save the effort needed to automate the questionnaire system
   involving better skill testing and formalization. Parts of Speech (POS)
   for a sentence can be assessed for improving and enhancing the
   utilization in students' querying skill in writing. Computer aided
   systems built-up on trained agents to assess data orientation for
   measuring the strength of the questionnaire as being plotted to test
   skill of the examinees. These agent needs to be made trained and
   provided with the data format capable to use for intelligent assessment
   and strong linkage. This can be done using platform of semantic web data
   model; well known as Resource Description Framework (RDF). To achieve
   this purposed study, we represent a methodology to identify each query
   statement tagged per its parts of speech. Then train agents to assess
   data impact in calculating complexity of each query. This tagged query
   is further transformed into RDF to give semantics and hierarchal
   attachment between parts of the speech.},

Abstract = {The phenomenon of low fertility has been negative impacted on the social
   structure of the educational environment in Taiwan. To increase the
   learning effectiveness of students became the most important issue for
   the Universities in Taiwan. Due to the subjective judgment of evaluators
   and the attributes of influenced factors are always fuzzy, it is not
   easy to measure the learning effectiveness by using the crisp values for
   the qualitative factors. In additional, the negative behaviors or the
   infrequent learning data (rare item sets) cannot easily excavate from
   educational database. Therefore, a systematic mining method is proposed
   here by combining fuzzy set theory with data mining technology to
   explore the key factors of learning effectiveness from the infrequent
   data. A case study implemented in this paper and showed that the
   proposed method can effectively find the important factors and valuable
   patterns from the survey data. The results of this paper can provide the
   important information for teachers to help students increase the
   learning effectiveness. Finally, the conclusions are addressed at the
   end of this paper.},

Abstract = {There has been a growing awareness of the contribution of play to the
   young children's learning and development. This study aims to
   investigate the implement of board games play on children's aesthetic
   experience and interpersonal understanding in Montessori and
   Constructivist classrooms. With the underlying framework follows a
   developmentally appropriate practice, Aesthetic Curriculum Outlines of
   Taiwan Education Bureau and Selman's conceptualization of interpersonal
   understanding of Negotiation Strategies (NS) and Shared Experience (SE)
   served as the standard to collect and analyze children's art work and
   play. The result is based on preschool educators' observing and mapping
   during 18-week period of what children (56 children aged 60-72 month)
   are offered within art work and board games play, including DRECKSAU,
   ZICKE ZACKE, and SLEEPING QUEENS. Analytical results of children's art
   work and school interviews showed difference in responsive and
   productive aesthetic experience in both classrooms. Analysis of NS and
   SE results showed a predominant use of Level 1 in both classrooms; while
   the Constructivist children had higher percentage and with more variety
   of Level 2 NS and SE. With comparison of NS and SE in friend and
   acquaintance pairings, there was no statistical difference in the
   interpersonal understanding; while there was significant difference in
   children's adoption of sub-categories in Level 1 NS. In the end, the
   results are discussed in terms of children's exploration and inquiry
   implications for early schooling educators.},

Abstract = {Technology is thought to affect people's behaviors and trigger feelings
   of anger and aggression, which in turn manifest into other problems. It
   is more important to develop strategies in order to avoid these
   behavioral problems than to concentrate on the anger and aggression
   demonstrated by individuals. This study aimed to develop strategies to
   help education administrators prevent the anger and aggression caused by
   the use of technology by students. In this qualitative study, a
   semi-structured interview form was prepared. By responding to the
   questions, the education administrators were able to put forth their
   views about the rage and aggression caused by the use of technology by
   the students, the preventions taken to minimize this effect, and the
   effectiveness of these preventions.},

Abstract = {Different ``thought experiments{''} dominate teaching approaches to
   weightlessness, reducing students' opportunities for active physics
   learning, which should include observations, descriptions, explanations
   and predictions of real phenomena. Besides the controversy related to
   conceptual definitions of weight and weightlessness, we report another
   controversy regarding the position of the person that weighs herself or
   himself in a freely-falling elevator, a ``thought experiment{''}
   commonly used for introducing the concept of weightlessness. Two
   XIX-century ``thought experiments{''}, one from America and one from
   Russia, show that they have a long tradition in physics teaching. We
   explored experimentally a ``thought experiment{''} that deals with the
   behavior of a mercury drop in a freely-falling elevator. Our
   experimental results show that the mercury drop neither took the
   expected spherical shape nor performed oscillatory motions predicted by
   theory. Teachers should encourage students to enrich active learning of
   weightlessness by thinking how to test experimentally the answers to
   some conceptual questions, a subclass of ``thought experiments{''}.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify students' changes of (i)
   interest toward STEM subjects and (ii) interest to pursuing STEM career
   after participating in non-formal integrated STEM education programme.
   The programme exposed students with integrated STEM education through
   project based learning involving the application of five phases
   engineering design process. Two cohorts of middle secondary students
   participated in 2014 (n=129) and 2015 (n=113) were involved in this
   study. The study utilized one group quasiexperimental design. The
   analysis revealed that, overall there is a significant increase in mean
   scores for interest towards STEM subjects and career after participating
   in the programme. The findings also indicated that the program was
   effective at modifying students' interest level as the result revealed
   positive changes (from moderate to high level) for both 2014 and 2015
   groups for interest toward STEM career (42.6\% and 69.9\% respectively)
   and interest towards STEM subjects (45\% and 82\% respectively).},

Abstract = {The communications revolution reaches all sectors of the population and
   makes information accessible to all. This development presents complex
   challenges which require changes in the education system, teaching
   methods and learning environment. The integration of ICT (Information
   and Communications Technology) and science teaching requires innovative
   teaching methods based on a constructivist approach. This study examines
   the extent to which science teachers in Israel who identify themselves
   as using ICT in their classrooms, actually integrate ICT in their
   practice, and use ICT to promote higher order thinking. The findings
   indicate that most teachers in this study use ICT tools primarily for
   visual aspects of their teaching, such as upgrading classroom
   demonstrations. Further, they are unaware of the need to change their
   teaching methods by adopting sophisticated computer applications
   relevant to science teaching. Even the minority who felt the need to
   change teaching methods do not know how to achieve this end.},

Abstract = {Peer review, as an e-assessment tool incorporates the human factor to
   treat complexity for rating and grading students. It could address the
   qualitative more than quantitative aspects with flexible human feedback
   that leads up to metacognitive knowledge aspects, which e-assessment
   usually is not able to achieve. Peer review is an internationally
   well-known method for quality assurance in science; it is now used for
   teaching and assessment in universities. This paper presents an analysis
   of five teaching scenarios that use peer review. All scenarios have been
   working with the same technical setting within different courses in
   Digital Business and included 765 participants. Regarding e-peer review
   qualitative and quantitative data from 298 students were collected. The
   tasks in the different learning scenarios differ between well-structured
   to complex and cognitively ambitious assignments like academic paper
   writing. Further analysis of criteria like lead time, support expense,
   dimension of cognitive processes, meeting of professional standards and
   social interaction shows how the five scenarios lead to either better or
   less efficient learning performances.},

Title = {Students' Perceptions and Behaviour in Technology-Rich Classroom and

Abstract = {Kurt Lewin proposed the field theory which stated that our behaviour was
   a result of both our personality and our environment. Based on this
   theory, it could be deduced that teacher's teaching behavior was a
   result of both teacher's personality and classroom environment.
   Considering the challenges of pedagogy transformation and the modest use
   of technologies in classroom, we hypothesize that designing and using
   technology-rich classroom (TRC) is one of the methods for changing the
   classroom from teacher-centered learning to more student-centered
   learning that encompasses replacing lectures with active learning,
   integrating self-paced learning programs and/or cooperative group
   situations, ultimately holding the student responsible for his own
   advances. In order to test our hypotheses, a TRC was designed according
   to the adapted SMATE model, and the differences of students'
   perceptions, learning and teaching behaviour in TRC and in multimedia
   classroom (MMC) were analyzed. SMATE model referred to the framework for
   equipping classroom, including showing content, managing facilitates,
   accessing technologies, tracking process, and enhancing learning. We
   conducted an experimental research in a primary school with 143 students
   from 4 classes. The experimental group comprised of two classes in a TRC
   environment. The environment was equipped with WiFi, wireless display,
   dual screens, and site facilitators. Additionally, an iPad was made
   available for every student in the class. The other two classes were the
   control group and had a MMC environment, in which a computer and a
   projector were equipped. The experiment lasted for one full semester
   with 12 weeks. The results indicated that the scores of students'
   perceptions in TRC were significantly higher than scores in MMC, and
   students spend more time engaged in individual learning and
   collaborative learning in the TRC than in the MMC.},

Abstract = {The Korean STEAM education pursues a convergent human resources
   education, but there are shortcomings associated with it due to the fact
   that it excludes the Humanities in its curriculum. This study embodies
   the accomplishments from the design and field application of the STEAM
   education model that has added Humanities fields (history, geography,
   and bibliography) to the five areas of STEAM (science, technology,
   engineering, art, and mathematics). The core principle of STEAM
   education is to utilize the traditional sciences as a medium that
   connects STEAM and the Humanities. It is designed to incorporate the
   eight core subjects as discipline studies of eight subjects and be
   implemented through the wheel model, developing into a multidisciplinary
   system. The STEAM education model was applied at two high schools over a
   two-year period as pilot programs. Both cases have undergone

Abstract = {This study investigates error sources and the effects of each error
   source to determine optimal weights of the composite score of teacher
   recommendation letters and self-introduction letters using multivariate
   generalizability theory. Data were collected from the science education
   institute for the gifted attached to the university located within in a
   capital city in Korea. The results were as follows. First, error sources
   for the students were relatively large suggesting that the score
   variances explained the differences in giftedness among the students.
   Second, based on the maximum generalizability coefficient for teacher
   recommendation letters and self-introduction letters, the optimal weight
   ratio should adjust to 0.7:0.3 from 0.5:0.5 in the original institution
   weights. These results are specific to the selection assessment
   instruments considered in this study; however, the methodology applied
   can be utilized in other selection instruments developed by many
   institutions.},

Abstract = {Teacher verbal feedback plays an important role in classroom teaching.
   Different types of feedback can have different effect on students'
   learning. Praise and blame feedback could provide positive and negative
   results for learners. The gap was left in considering teachers'
   attitudes in providing verbal feedback to students. Due to feedback
   which may culture dependently, the types of teachers' verbal feedback
   were studied based on analysis of 24 teachers from 4 regions (Shenyang,
   Beijing, Hangzhou and Chongqing) in junior secondary mathematics
   classrooms of China. A coding scheme on the attitudes of teacher verbal
   feedback was developed which included three categories: ``Negative{''},
   ``Neutral{''} and ``Positive (Encourage in gesture \& Encourage in
   action){''}. Feedback frequency and duration were documented and showed
   that teachers hold neutral attitudes mostly. Teaching method
   (student-centered or teacher-centered) and school policy were the most
   apparent factors presented by this study which can have effect on
   teacher's verbal feedback.},

Abstract = {In the information technology advance era with constantly expanded
   knowledge and the requirements of the general public for school
   education, a lot of different education ideas are introduced in the
   education reforms, such as school-based characteristic curriculum,
   teachers professional development, professional learning community,
   learning community, and flip education. Teachers, as knowledge
   disseminators, therefore are encountering the problem of enhancing the
   competitiveness. Constant learning has become an important part of
   teachers pursuing excellence and promoting teacher efficacy in the
   career. They have to constantly absorb new knowledge to conform to
   modern demands for professionalized teachers. Aiming at universities in
   Indonesia, total 500 copies of questionnaires are distributed and 347
   effective ones are responded, with the retrieval rate 69\%. The research
   results show significant correlations between 1. Knowledge shares and
   creative teaching, 2. Creative teaching and teacher efficacy, and 3.
   Knowledge share and teacher efficacy. Aiming at the results, suggestions
   are proposed in this study, expecting to promote teachers creative,
   active, and innovative teaching methods or teaching contents.},

Abstract = {Understanding chemistry includes the ability to think on three levels:
   the macroscopic level, the symbolic level, and the level of particles -
   sub-microscopic level. Pupils have the most difficulty when trying to
   understand the sub-microscopic level because it is outside their range
   of experience. A virtual laboratory enables a simultaneous demonstration
   of all three levels of a chemical concept along with dynamic
   visualisation at the submicroscopic level. This study presents the
   effective usage of a virtual laboratory that can overcome the gap
   between the previously-mentioned conceptual levels. We carried out a
   didactic experiment to test the effectiveness of a virtual laboratory
   that enables dynamic visualisation. The experiment involved
   seventh-grade pupils (N = 109) from five different primary schools in
   Slovenia. We asked ourselves the question as to whether the learning
   outcomes of pupils are better when they use a virtual laboratory rather
   than in science classes without a virtual laboratory where dynamic
   visualisation at the submicroscopic and sub-micro levels are only
   explained by means of static demonstrations. A virtual laboratory has
   many significant advantages. The results of the didactic experiment
   showed that, in terms of knowledge acquisition, using a virtual
   laboratory is better than science classes without visualisation
   elements.},

Abstract = {The approach of information digitalization era has largely changed the
   teaching environment on campus. The application of information
   technology to education has become a concern in modern education.
   Traditional basic literacy of reading, writing, and algorithm could no
   longer cope with the demands in information societies that the
   information technology ability has become the fourth basic literacy for
   modern citizens. In face of changes, first-line teachers are in
   education required for adequate information literacy to integrate
   information technology equipment into instruction and to be competent
   for the role of teachers. Nonetheless, successful information technology
   teaching environments simply with adequate computer hardware and
   software equipment could not guarantee excellent teaching performance.
   Instead, it is necessary for teachers presenting adequate information
   literacy to integrate information technology into instructional
   processes, having students perceive the convenience and use security of
   information technology equipment, enhancing students' learning
   interests, and promoting teachers' professional growth and teachers'
   teaching efficacy. Aiming at university teachers in central Taiwan and
   Fujian Province, 450 copies of questionnaires are distributed in this
   study. Total 288 valid copies are collected, with the retrieval rate
   64\%. The research results are summarized as below. 1. Information
   literacy reveals significantly positive effects on information
   technology integrated instruction. 2. Information technology integrated
   instruction shows notably positive effects on teaching effectiveness. 3.
   Information literacy presents remarkably positive effects on teaching
   effectiveness. Aiming at the research results, some suggestions are
   proposed, expecting to help teachers promote the teaching effectiveness
   by applying information technology equipment to teaching activities or
   processes with sufficient information literacy.},

Abstract = {Metacognitive enrichment has become an important component of modern
   mathematics instruction. This study investigates the effect of homework
   assignments enriched with metacognitive questions on students'
   mathematics achievement and homework behaviors. A quasi-experimental
   design with pre- and post-test measures and two groups (experimental and
   control) was employed to investigate the effect of the enriched
   homework. Forty-four students, 25 boys and 19 girls, participated in the
   study. The students in the experimental group responded to metacognitive
   questions as they worked on homework that otherwise was common to both
   groups. First semester mathematics scores taken from students' report
   cards were used as a pre-test of mathematics achievement; the mean of
   second and third examination scores were used as a post-test. The
   results revealed a significant difference between the mathematics scores
   of students who had been given homework assignments enriched with
   metacognitive questions and those who had not been given such homework.},

Abstract = {Embedding Web 2.0 in learning processes has extended learning from
   traditional based learning-centred to a collaborative based
   learning-centred institution that emphasises learning anywhere and
   anytime. While deploying Semantic Web into e-learning offers a broader
   spectrum of pervasive knowledge acquisition to enrich users' experience
   in learning. In conventional learning practices, a student is perceived
   as a recipient of information and knowledge. However, nowadays many
   institutions involve students in learning processes that play an active
   role in improving collaborative learning platform and knowledge sharing
   as well as participation. For education provider, choosing a
   collaborative learning platform is becoming more important than choosing
   a tool in the new paradigm. Implementing collaborative learning through
   Web 2.0 is attributed to e-learning 2.0 as an approach for an online
   learning solution. Researchers have employed contents analysis for
   reviewing literatures in peer-reviewed journals. In fact, researchers
   found e-learning 2.0 is not only addressing the need redefining
   technologies like cloud computing in e-learning but also the need of
   redefining value added through pervasive knowledge generated from
   Semantic Web and Social networks. E-learning 2.0 can be a solution to
   make learning systems in a higher education is flexible in terms of
   resources adoption, pervasive knowledge acquisition, and cloud computing
   implementation.},

Abstract = {Different diagnostic tools have been developed and used by researchers
   to identify students' conceptions. The present study aimed to provide an
   overview of the common diagnostic instruments in science to assess
   students' misconceptions. Also the study provides a brief comparison of
   these common diagnostic instruments with their strengths and weaknesses.
   A total of 273 articles published (from the year 1980 to 2014) in main
   journals were investigated thoroughly through document analysis method.
   The study reveals interviews (53\%), open-ended tests (34\%),
   multiple-choice tests (32\%) and multiple tier tests (13\%) as the most
   commonly used diagnostic tools. However, each tool has some advantages
   as well as disadvantages over the others that should be kept in mind in
   their usages. A careful user of a diagnostic instrument such as a
   classroom teacher or a researcher would be aware of the diagnostic
   instruments and selects the most effective one for his/her purposes.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a curriculum-based multidimensional computerized
   adaptive test that was developed for Indonesia junior high school
   Biology. In adherence to the Indonesian curriculum of different Biology
   dimensions, 300 items was constructed, and then tested to 2238 students.
   A multidimensional random coefficients multinomial logit model was used
   to develop multidimensional scales. A simulation study based on the item
   and ability parameters estimated from real data is conducted to evaluate
   the performance of the proposed Biology-MCAT system. The results show
   that the bias and standard error of Biology-MCAT system are acceptable.
   It suggests that, this online assessment system can be a model for
   Indonesian National Examination in future.},

Abstract = {The systemizing and empathizing brain type represent two contrasted
   students' characteristics. The present study investigated differences in
   the conceptions and approaches to learning science between the
   systemizing and empathizing brain type students. The instruments are
   questionnaires on the systematizing and empathizing, questionnaires on
   the conceptions of learning science and questionnaires on the approaches
   to learning science. The data showed that the conception of learning
   science as taking tests was negatively correlated with the systemizing
   but not correlated with the empathizing. However, the conception of
   learning science as increasing knowledge and understanding was more
   positively correlated with the empathizing. The deep motive and strategy
   were more positively related with the systemizing than the empathizing,
   while the latter was more negatively correlated with the surface
   strategy. Our study suggests that while students with high systemizing
   are more motivated to learn science the ability to empathize is also
   important for successful science study.},

Abstract = {Students can learn subjects more meaningfully through integrated
   education, as it helps them to link school education with their real
   lives. There is a strong need to develop an alternative integration
   method to promote effective implementation of integrated education at a
   classroom level. The purpose of this study was to develop a model for
   instructional design for the integration of mathematics and science, and
   to design and implement instructions using the developed model. The
   implications of applying the model to lower grade students in Korea were

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to determine the digital propensities of
   post-secondary students (N=409) in various faculties/colleges at a large
   state university located in southwestern Turkey. It was also examined
   whether gender, the program attended, socioeconomic status, education
   type (first and second shift education), the number of family members
   and the number of computers per household are contributing factors to
   Information and Communication Technologies use. According to the data
   analyzed, male students use Information and Communication Technologies
   more than female students. Results also suggest that faculty attended,
   education type, family income, the number of computers and children per
   household are some of the important factors in having high digital
   propensity index.},

Abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) has become an inseparable
   part of schoolwork and a goal of education to prepare scientifically
   literate and digitally competent citizens. Yet the introduction of
   computers into school work has been much slower than its introduction in
   other spheres of life. Teachers' lack of knowledge/skills and difficulty
   in integrating ICT into instruction affect the realization of
   computer-related goals in schools. Another hidden obstacle that can
   affect the introduction of computers into the Biology laboratory can be
   discomfort with the interpretation of graphs obtained by data-loggers.
   We can group these difficulties with graph outcomes into 4 areas: 1)
   Explanations of the curves that lie beyond the domain of Biology, in
   Physics, Chemistry or some other discipline; 2) Hardware properties; 3)
   Unknown properties of experimental components; 4) Occasional equipment
   breakdowns or crashes.},

Abstract = {The Sultanate of Oman is beginning to experience a rapid increase in
   `lifestyle' diseases, most notably diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
   These may be linked to increasing poor dietary habits, and a more
   sedentary lifestyle, amongst the younger generation. In a number of
   Western contexts, school gardens have been shown to improve not only
   student attitudes to diet but also improved learning and affective
   outcomes. A pilot school gardening project involving a mixed method
   quasi-experimental design was undertaken in Oman with a number of Grade
   7 classes. While the outcomes of this study should be treated
   tentatively, the quantitative findings indicate that employing school
   gardens as an educational resource might improve learning outcomes in
   the area of science skill development. The qualitative findings
   suggested that the project had a positive impact on the affective domain
   of students and in some cases encouraged them to pursue healthier eating
   habits.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of instructional
   mode, methods, and interaction between them. In order to achieve this
   purpose, two two-level-independent variables were defined, teaching
   modes (blended vs. face-to-face) and teaching methods (expository vs.
   inquiry). Thus, a 2x2 factorial design was performed with four treatment
   groups of 314 students. Before and after the treatments, pre-tests and
   post-tests on achievement in electricity concepts, science process
   skills, and attitudes toward physics were administered. For the analysis
   of the data multivariate analysis of covariance were performed. It was
   found that the effect of blended mode is not dependent upon the teaching
   methods implemented. Related to the effects of instructional mode;
   blended instruction is more effective than face-to-face instruction in
   supporting students' achievement in electricity and science process
   skills. Additionally, it was found that the expository teaching method
   is as effective as the inquiry teaching method.},

Abstract = {In mathematics learning, it is important to solve problems. However, it
   is not easy for students to design and implement an effective
   problem-solving plan. Therefore, we propose a problem-oriented teaching
   method based on the existing literature. The purpose of this study is to
   investigate the influence of this problem-oriented teaching method on
   the learning effectiveness of students. Research subjects were part of
   two classes that were randomly selected from a public university in
   China; one was the experimental group that was subjected to the
   problem-oriented teaching method, and the other was the comparison group
   that was subjected to the traditional teaching method. In this study, at
   the beginning and end of the semester, the experimental and control
   groups were assessed. The results of the empirical analysis show that
   the problem-oriented teaching method was more effective at improving
   mathematics achievement and reducing the differences in scores between
   urban and rural students than traditional teaching methods. Suggestions
   and implications for teaching are also proposed for mathematics
   educators and mathematics education researchers: teachers should not
   only ask questions but also guide students to ask questions.},

Abstract = {Corporate governance, an important study on enterprise operation and
   management, aims to have an enterprise effectively supervise
   organizational activity and operation through favorable management and
   supervision systems or mechanisms. When a company presents sound
   corporate governance, the managers would maximize corporate value and
   shareholders' equity to enhance the business performance and corporate
   value.
   Listed high-tech industries in Shanghai are sampled for this study. The
   data are acquired from China Economic and Financial Research Database.
   The research results conclude 1. significantly positive correlations
   between corporate governance and Accounting Education, 2. remarkably
   positive correlations between Accounting Education and enterprise value,
   3. notably positive correlations between corporate governance and
   enterprise value, and 4. mediation effects of Accounting Education
   between corporate governance and enterprise value. The results could
   provide reference for managers in domestic high-tech industries making
   investment decisions and governmental authorities formulating relevant
   regulations. Good match with corporate governance allows a company
   thoroughly developing the benefit of capital expenditure to further
   create higher corporate value.},

Abstract = {This study utilized the Theory of Planned Behavior as our basis, while
   considering important demographic variables such as gender and age, we
   constructed a comprehensive model of elementary school teachers'
   behavioral intentions regarding web-based professional development. A
   survey was conducted among 359 elementary school teachers, and path
   analysis was used to construct a model of elementary school teachers'
   behavioral intentions regarding web-based professional development. The
   following conclusions are made: (1) demographic variables (gender and
   age) had only indirect effects on teachers' behavioral intentions
   regarding web-based professional development; age in particular had a
   negative impact on perceived behavioral control, which in turn
   negatively influenced such behavioral intentions; (2) the primary factor
   influencing elementary school teachers' behavioral intentions in this
   regard was attitude, followed by perceived behavioral control. Based on
   the above conclusions, we propose specific suggestions for researchers,
   practitioners, administrators, and professional development specialists.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to define secondary education directors and
   teachers awareness of preventing ``cyber-bullying{''}. The participants
   are directors and teachers at Near East College in the second half of
   the 2016-2017 academic year. A qualitative research method was used in
   this study. An open-ended questionnaire was administered to obtain the
   participants' views. The data obtained showed that the directors and
   teachers were aware of ``cyber-bullying{''} and the students faced
   ``cyber-bullying{''} from time to time. It was also found that the
   development in technology created the necessity of ``cyber-bullying{''}
   awareness among directors and teachers.},

Abstract = {Modern ecological crisis threatens the sustainability of human
   civilization. Awareness and education for probable disaster risk
   reduction give greater urgency to the issue of decreasing industrial
   failure rates associated with basic manufacturing activities and,
   consequently, improving the training in this area. The authors have
   highlighted the features of modern risk based approach in engineering
   training based on proximity of production entities to anthropogenic
   factors: allocation of risks and threats in professional and personal
   situations or tasks; critical analysis of any industrial process and
   considering its consequences; using professional and personal risk
   response strategies; risk-based thinking as the core professional
   activity. The paper considers the mechanism of risk-based thinking as a
   necessary part of engineering students training on the basis of
   diversionary analysis, and gives its algorithm adapted to their learning
   activities. A system of professional tasks and tools to be used in the
   students' future job has been developed to promote their readiness and
   willingness to work across trades within the sphere of their technical
   competency. The paper is intended for researchers, practitioners,
   managers of enterprises dealing with ecological and economic production
   activities, as well as for professional training of engineers.},

Abstract = {In this paper, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used for
   decomposing the quarterly data of year-on-year GDP growth rate from 2000
   to 2016. Four intrinsic modes of different frequency scales and
   inclusive of economic growth volatility are obtained, together with one
   smooth residual term. Based on the validity information of the
   decomposed waveforms, the statistical method and the economic
   significance information are identified for exploring the inherent law
   of economic growth, before concluding that the economic growth
   volatility mechanism is comprised of the short-, medium- and long-term
   influential factors and a relatively stable basic element. Empirical
   analysis has found that the impacts of long-term volatility factors are
   dominant and tend to be determined by the business cycle.},

Abstract = {A novel multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method is designed
   for comparing and ranking resolution solutions to a brownfield
   redevelopment project. In particular, an MCDA technique called the
   modified multilevel grey evaluation method is developed using concepts
   from grey systems theory, entropy and the analytical hierarchical
   process (AHP). To obtain weights for the range of criteria and
   sub-criteria used to assess and compare the resolution solutions,
   results obtained using AHP and an entropy technique are combined. In
   order to reflect uncertainty in the evaluation scores of the resolutions
   according to the sub-criteria, a grey systems class is employed to
   appropriately transform the scores. Subsequently, the evaluation method
   for the resolutions along with the combined weights is used to rank the
   resolutions. To demonstrate how this new methodology can be conveniently
   used in practice and provide valuable insights for aiding decision
   making, it is applied to a brownfield site in Xi'an, China, created by a
   former chemical factory.},

Abstract = {Using the turnover decomposition model, I extract unexpected trading
   volume from the institutional investors' trading activity to measure the
   institutional investors' heterogeneous beliefs and explore the
   explanatory power of that on stock returns. Portfolios built according
   to the magnitude of institutional investors' heterogeneous beliefs are
   significantly profitable. The expected returns of portfolios with higher
   heterogeneous beliefs are significantly higher than other portfolios,
   particularly for small companies, and the influence of institutional
   investors' heterogeneous beliefs on stock returns during the current
   month is significantly positive, but it is significantly negative for
   the next month. When considering beta, bm, size and short-sales
   constraints, the conclusion is still valid.},

Abstract = {The study reviews Chinese and international regional innovation capacity
   and extenics theory, and applies extenics theory to construct a
   measurement model of regional innovation coordination. It empirically
   researches 31 Chinese provinces on the coordination of regional
   innovation in both 2007 and 2015. The research findings indicate that
   the Industry-University-Research status is not optimistic in China: on
   the one hand, the coordination abilities of most enterprises are
   relatively low; and on the other hand, compared with 2007, the
   proportion of areas with good coordination dropped 10\% in 2015. It is
   thus clear that the effect of adjustments by relevant government
   departments relating to Industry-University-Research is poor and the
   coordination of innovation abilities in some provinces are falling
   rather than rising. Relevant decision-making authorities should take
   note of this and take more effective measures to promote the
   coordination of research cooperation and to enhance regional
   coordination.},

Abstract = {The modern paradigm of education development has new demands on the
   professional and personal traits of a teacher, in particular, the
   ability to organize research activity of schoolchildren and to support
   their interest in science. The research competence of future teachers is
   a key characteristic that provides these skills. Properly organized
   research activity of future science teachers contributes not only to
   their research competence development, but also to their self-confidence
   as a professional, and thus, supports their motivation for further
   improvement in the field of teaching. This article presents a developed
   model of a methodological system for organizing the research activity
   development in training the future biologists at the pedagogical
   university. Based on the model, we have developed a comprehensive
   program for student's research competence development, which was tested
   at two courses of a pedagogical university. Comparison of the nine
   experimental groups (220 students) and nine control groups (218
   students) showed that our program designed to develop student's research
   competence is effective. The paper also discusses the conditions, under
   which the program is effective, in particular, the importance of
   continuing education of teacher educators, as well as the necessity of
   interaction between educational and scientific institutions.},

Abstract = {The research purpose is to determine certain science-based approaches to
   using distance education technologies in the course of work with
   preschool children, taking into consideration the special nature of
   Russian preschool education; to identify the variable-based models for
   using Distance Education Technologies (DET) in preschool education. The
   following science-based approaches to the research problem were
   determined taking into consideration the special nature of Russian
   preschool education: axiological, personality-oriented, system-activity,
   technological, integrated. The matrix of DET implementation models in
   preschool education was presented (model of integrated distance
   education, Virtual Kindergarten model, Correspondence model,
   Case-technology model). The study proved that there are real solutions
   for using DET in preschool education; it also suggested organizational
   models of DET introduction. The materials of the article can be useful
   for administrators, educators, teaching staff of preschool educational
   organizations (PEO), and preschoolers' parents.},

Abstract = {Physics' curricula of Italian Scientific High Schools in the last years
   have been enhanced by the introduction of Quantum Mechanics and Content
   and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). Education monitoring reveals
   that last year's students are experiencing many issues in learning in
   their second language (L2) and advanced and counter-intuitive contents.
   Our experiment is aimed at understanding and then overcoming those
   problems using educational methodologies based on social aspects. Thanks
   to the Internet, a communicative style can be exploited where teachers
   could keep teaching, playing the role of semiotic mediators. Multimedia
   and simulations broadly available in MOOCS suggested a flipped classroom
   approach coping with the project of CLIL lessons. In our experience two
   classrooms of students were selected, starting from very similar
   performances and skills. The first one was taught with traditional
   lectures and tests; the second one, instead, attended to experimental
   lessons. Students could share their ideas and learning supports through
   a Facebook group, a blog, virtual classrooms and a website.
   Nevertheless, at the end of the experience an eTwinning exchange was
   planned, to spread the experiment towards foreign schools. The outcomes
   of the tests performed on the students were analysed and unexpected
   results were drawn. An extension to larger numbers of students, the
   introduction of different methodologies and the research about different
   topics in Physics could potentially develop this research.},

Abstract = {In recent years, school readiness of children has become a hotspot issue
   in studies. School readiness refers to various key features and basic
   conditions required by children in the formal education. The study on
   school readiness plays an important value on early identification and
   timely intervention of potential development risks. To reflect family
   influence factors on children's school readiness, this paper compiles a
   set of evaluation tools with locally targeted school readiness of
   children in accordance with characteristics of children, combines them
   with SRTB-CV, and selects a total of 288 children in Wuchuan Autonomous
   County, Guizhou, China to carry out an individual test. The study
   compiles a measuring tool suitable for evaluating school readiness of
   Chinese children, conducts system inspection and profound analysis of
   family influence factors for school readiness of children, and proposes
   constructive recommendations on carrying out family education practices
   for school readiness of children.},

Abstract = {Education materials such as computers, tablets etc. used in the
   education of normally developing children starting from pre-school, are
   also used in the education of the children with special needs, albeit
   inadequately. Computer-aided education has a significant potential in
   terms of increasing the educational experiences and facilitating the
   education of the children with special needs. Despite its limited use in
   our country, the said technology, which has been used in the western
   world for a long time, has become a tool that supports the academic
   skills of the individuals with special needs as well as facilitating
   their daily lives. In this study, literature related to the
   children/youth diagnosed with ASD were scanned and information has been
   compiled in such subjects; ``the targets set to develop the skills of
   children/youth diagnosed with ASD through the usage of technologyaided
   education and the results, thereof, achieved; the content of the
   programmes that were applied and the differences between desk-based and
   computer-based education. Even though all the studies were case studies,
   the outcome shows that technology supported education brings out a more
   positive development. While obtaining information through the scanning
   of the said literature, face-to-face interviews were held and relevant
   questions were asked to the professional staff who work in the field of
   special education and deal with the children diagnosed with ASD in the
   TRNC, with the aim of finding out their perspective vis-a-vis the
   technology aided education of the children/youth diagnosed with ASD.
   This study aims to provide information, to parents and to experts who
   work in the domain of special education and to shed a light to
   researchers who will engage in future, more detailed studies.},

Abstract = {This literature review synthesizes empirical data of 18 articles
   published between 2000 and 2015 about teaching and learning science
   outdoors from kindergarten to secondary levels (K-12). We asked four
   questions: (1) What are the general characteristics of the corpus of
   studies on teaching and learning science outdoors in schools' immediate
   surroundings at K-12 levels? (2) What are the authors' aims for
   conducting studies about teaching and learning science outdoors? (3)
   What are the main outcomes related to teaching and learning science
   outdoors in schools' immediate surroundings? (4) What further studies
   should, according to the selected articles, be conducted in the future?
   We identified three categories of authors' aims: environmental
   education, science education, and outdoor education. The main outcomes
   are classified into four categories: 1) learning, 2) student attitude or
   interest, 3) other students' perceptions, and 4) challenges to outdoor
   science teaching. Finally, in light of the review, we discuss how
   further studies should consider learning outcomes, students' attitudes,
   challenges, and methodological guidelines.},

Abstract = {Safety education is a kind of effective means by which people can
   improve safety consciousness, can master the safety theory, regulations
   and technology standard. The most important reason of work-safety
   accident is human factor and the level of safety behaviors and emergency
   capability of production people is the focus of human factors. From the
   cognitive perspective, the article analyzes the pre-attentive processing
   features of human under the industrial auto-control background through
   people's information processing. Therefore article propose a cognitive
   neural experiment approach based HCI. Article used the auto-control
   interface of the towing vessels of ocean engineering vessels to simulate
   that of the real operating room. The figures on the central interface
   presented that the regular winding drum speed of the towing machine was
   7.5m/min and the graphic symbols on the both sides of the interface
   presented the system pressure safety alerting signals of the towing
   machine. Normally, the safety alerting signals on the two sides of the
   interface were green rectangles, but abnormally they would be red
   vertical rectangles, red horizontal rectangles or red hexagons. Namely,
   the task-related stimuli appeared in the center of people's view but the
   task-unrelated stimuli appeared on the sides. The subjects were informed
   to concentrate on the winding drum speed on the center of the interface
   and ignore the pressure safety alerting signals on the sides. If the
   winding drum speed changes, the subjects should react as soon as
   possible. The experiment adopted Oddball and Equiprobable paradigms,
   using Event-related Potential (ERP) technology to verify. The results
   show that all of the 3 kinds of safety alerting signals can cause Visual
   Mismatch Negativity (vMMN) negative wave but the strength values are
   different. The pressure safety alerting signals of red horizontal
   rectangle are easier to cause the operator's attention.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to determine the entrepreneurial characteristics
   and hope and despair levels of students at the Near East University
   Faculty of Health Sciences. The research population comprises 296
   students of the total research population of 310 students were
   interviewed. In the research, a descriptive survey model was used aiming
   to determine the entrepreneurial tendencies and despair levels of the
   students. A questionnaire form consisting of 3 sections, including
   introductory features, an entrepreneurship scale and Beck' Depression
   Inventory were used as the data collection tool. In the second section
   of the questionnaire, an entrepreneurship scale devised by Iscan and
   Kaygin in 2011 was used to determine entrepreneurial tendencies of the
   students participating. Data collected were transferred to electronic
   media and analysed in a SPSS 21.0 statistical package program. The
   students generally scored a low Beck's Depression Scale point and their
   despair levels were found to be low - in other words, their hope levels
   were high. The points scored on the scales overall alongside success
   needs and risk taking extents of students stating their income was
   higher than their expenditure was found to be statistically significant
   (p<0.05).},

Abstract = {The two-stage dynamic game of visitor education with incentive mechanism
   is proposed in this paper to study how to raise the effect of the
   visitor education and how to inspirit the visitors to take part in
   visitor education programme. In the first stage of the game, the park's
   managers should choose proper strategies including positive and negative
   incentives for visitors. They should choose the optimal inspiriting
   measures and strengths to encourage the visitors to take part in the
   education intervention programme. In the second stage of the game, the
   visitors can decide whether they take part in the visitor education and
   obey the park's rules to reduce their unwanted behaviors or not. There
   are negative utilities for the visitors when they Obey rules of the park
   and reduce their unwanted behaviors. And the negative utilities function
   of the visitors is strict concave. The park can induce the visitors to
   obey the rules and reduce their unwanted behaviors by visitor education
   intervention programme. The cost of facilities maintenance and nature
   resource recovering fee, cleaning fee and so on can be saved by reducing
   visitors' unwanted behaviors. The cost saving of the park is the return
   of developing visitor education programme. The return function is
   convex. The law of diminishing returns is satisfied. And the return
   growth rate declines gradually when the visitors' efforts to reduce
   their unwanted behaviors increase. The Nash Equilibrium solution of the
   game shows that the park should set up effective and creative incentive
   mechanism according to the visitor's negative utilities, the expectation
   of visitors' satisfaction and visitors' sensitivity to inspiriting
   measures. The incentive mechanisms reflecting multi-benefit demands,
   common-benefits and joint-responsibilities can inspirit the visitors to
   participate in the visitor education interventions actively and reduce
   the negative impacts in tourism destinations.},

Abstract = {In practical environments, e-learners encounter service providers of
   varying quality. A wide range of criteria are used to assess service
   quality, but most of these criteria have interdependent or interactive
   characteristics, which can make it difficult to effectively analyze and
   improve service quality. The purpose of this study is to address this
   issue using a hybrid MCDM (multiple criteria decision-making) approach
   that includes the DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation
   laboratory), DANP (the DEMATELbased analytic network process) and VIKOR
   methods to achieve an optimal solution. By exploring the influential
   interrelationships between criteria related to e-learning, this approach
   can be used to solve interdependence and feedback problems, allowing for
   greater satisfaction of the actual needs of e-learners.},

Abstract = {The psychological problems of college students have aroused general
   concerns. A lot of college students are plagued by all kinds of
   psychological health problems. Psychological health problems brought a
   lot of negative effects to them. The psychological assessment data and
   the basic information collected from 6500 freshmen are used to analyze
   association rules and characteristics of college students' psychological
   factors in this paper. The symptom self-rating scale (SCL-90) was
   compiled by L.R. Derogatis in 1975, which contains 90 items. The SCL-90
   has been used in a wide range of psychiatric symptoms. The SCL-90
   includes ten factors, such as somatization, obsessive-compulsive
   symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility,
   terror, paranoia, psychosis and other factors. The PNARC model is
   introduced in this paper to mine the positive and negative association
   rules from real SCL-90 data set of one Chinese college. The
   support-confidence framework and the correlation test method are
   obtained to delete the contradict association rules and get the positive
   and negative association rules for correctly analyzing the potential
   relationship of SCL-90 factors. Mined positive and negative association
   rules are also helpful to analyze and coach the mental health of college
   students.},

Abstract = {Relevance of the research problem stems from the need to meet the
   challenges of personal growth of each participant of the educational
   process, a productive exchange of information and personalized
   contribution to the overall result of the conducted educational
   research. The aim of this paper is to improve joint training activities
   as the basis for future studies of masters that will be implemented in
   an open information and education space. The key approach to the study
   of the problems of the joint educational researches relies on the
   conceptual ideas of experiments conducting in joint environment in which
   access to individual and shared data in an open information education
   environment is restricted. Theoretical and technological tools were
   developed for working with factorial data of collaborative research in
   open educational environment. As a result these conceptual ideas were
   formulated for joint training of master's studies: the stages to improve
   joint research activities were grounded, the technology of forming joint
   bank of comparable research materials was created, the system of
   algorithms for collaborative (joint) working with experimental data was
   proposed, the strategy ensuring the adequacy of the joint pilot
   materials for attaining general and private purposes was worked out.
   This strategy also should be applied to the value and usefulness of
   collected data. The collected, studied, processed and presented in the
   paper unique experimental material can be useful both for solving
   current individual research tasks of undergraduates and for the
   development of new roles in research.},

Abstract = {New educational standards implementation prioritizes the projective
   beginning of training in school education. Therefore, consideration of
   educational activity only as the process of obtaining ready knowledge
   should be abandoned. Thus the relevance of the studied problem is
   substantiated by the need to develop methodical works connected with the
   introduction of inter-subject projects into mathematics teachers'
   pedagogical activity as mathematics has a wide application in various
   sciences, though, at lessons, it is left behind due to time limits and
   insufficient mathematical apparatus school students possess. All that
   said specifies the goal of the paper: to define opportunities of
   project-based activity application in integration of mathematical and
   natural-science disciplines and development of methodical
   recommendations on its broad application in the course of training in
   the subject. The key research method of this problem is modeling the
   system of possible project-based activity directions aimed to work
   purposefully to increase results in subject studied as well as to
   develop meta-subject abilities. The paper proves the necessity to apply
   project-based technology in the form of inter-subject projects on
   mathematics; the basic models of school disciplines integration in the
   context of project-based learning opportunities realization are
   revealed; project themes of integrated disciplines that differ in time
   periods, volume and quantity are elaborated; features of their use in
   the course of studying mathematics are identified. Practical application
   of this system compensates the lack of tools of meta-subject
   technologies in pedagogical activity as it demands the ability to work
   in team, communicative skills, tolerance, self-organization, abilities
   to set goals independently, to achieve them and to analyze obtained
   results.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to explore the gender differences of participants'
   learning results, perceptions and gaming behaviors related to an energy
   quiz game with both single-player and multiplayer game modes
   simultaneously provided for participants. Seventy-four ninth-grade
   students played the game in six classes over three weeks. The
   pretest-posttest on energy knowledge and a survey on computer gaming
   attitude, competitive attitude and participation perception were also
   conducted in this study. The research findings indicated that although
   the female participants exhibited lower online gaming experience and a
   less positive gaming attitude than the male participants did before the
   experiment, all the participants had positive attitudes toward the quiz
   game, and the participants of both genders preferred the multiplayer
   game mode. However, the females had significantly better learning
   performance on energy knowledge acquisition than the males did after
   playing the game. More females than males were in favor of the
   single-player game mode according to the clustering analysis of
   students' gaming behaviors. After an in-depth analysis, this study found
   that their negative attitude toward computer games could be an important
   factor in explaining why more females than males preferred the
   single-player game mode, and why females performed better on learning
   performance than males did.},

   method for carrying out this strategy that involves boosting the

Abstract = {The study investigated the use of Quantum Physics Conceptual Survey
   (QPCS) in probing student understanding of quantum physics. Altogether
   103 Finnish university students responded to QPCS. The mean scores of
   the student responses were calculated and the test was evaluated using
   common five indices: Item difficulty index, Item discrimination index,
   Item point biserial index, Kuder-Richardson Formula 21, and Ferguson's
   delta. The results show that QPCS is not well suitable for probing
   Finnish university students' understanding of basic ideas of quantum
   physics in its current form. Based on the calculated indices, QPCS was
   too difficult for the participating students as an introductory-level
   test. The discrimination ability of QPCS was also vague. There were
   numerous individual test items, which were both too difficult and poor
   discriminators. Particularly, the items of theme Waves and Particles
   seemed to be problematic because they required understanding of the
   Standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is not discussed in
   the Finnish upper secondary curriculum or in basic physics studies in
   the university. It seems that the QPCS may have potential as an
   instrument to probe Finnish students' understanding of quantum physics
   but only after some careful modifications.},

Abstract = {Background:
   The technological and vocational higher education system in Taiwan is
   offering an undergraduate degree for design-based vocational high school
   students and general high school students whose qualitative and
   quantitative abilities are evaluated through a student selection
   examination.
   Material and methods:
   This study focused on the conceptual understandings of 64 freshmen with
   different backgrounds in design who have taken a full 18-week basic
   design course. Through this curriculum arrangement, the research team
   aimed to understand the distinctive learning achievements and basic
   design capacity of people in those two diverse background groups.
   Results:
   The results revealed that general high school students received higher
   evaluations on overall performance capabilities than vocational high
   school students did in the experiment, contradicting the common notion
   that students who graduate from vocational school have stronger design
   skills than students of other backgrounds do.
   Conclusions:
   We conclude that the technical and vocational education system might not
   effectively execute the design practical training curriculum. Another
   reason may be the credentialism present in Taiwanese society.},

Abstract = {This research explored how different models of Web-based dynamic
   assessment in remedial teaching improved junior high school student
   learning achievement and their misconceptions about the topic of
   `Weather and Climate.' This research adopted a quasi-experimental
   design. A total of 58 7th graders participated in this research.
   Participants were divided into the experiment group (28 participants)
   and the control group (30 participants). The experiment group took the
   `personalized Web-based dynamic assessment' while the control group took
   the `non-personalized Web-based dynamic assessment.' The two groups of
   students received the same lessons via conventional teaching prior to
   the experiment, and after the lessons were completed, they both took the
   pre-tests of the achievement test and the two-tier diagnostic test.
   After the tests, different models of Web-based dynamic assessment were
   administered to facilitate student learning. Once the Web-based dynamic
   assessments were accomplished, the two groups of students took the
   post-tests of the achievement test and the two-tier diagnostic test.
   Research findings reveal that students in the experiment group
   experience significantly better improvement in their learning
   achievement and misconceptions.},

Abstract = {A situated Chinese cultural festival learning system based on motion
   sensing is developed in this study. The primary design principle is to
   create a highly interactive learning environment, allowing learners to
   interact with Kinect through natural gestures in the designed learning
   situation to achieve efficient learning. The system has the following
   characteristics: the learning activities and contents are designed
   according to the key elements of situated learning theory; the system
   combines augmented reality with a real environment to provide
   story-based learning situations for learners. The Lantern Festival is
   used as the learning objective of this study, and 74 students from four
   third to fourth-grade level classes at Shanhua Elementary School in
   Tainan City were recruited as the study participants. In the experiment,
   the students were divided into a control group receiving traditional
   teaching and an experimental group that employed the system developed in
   this study. To assess the proposed system, questionnaire analysis and
   learning achievement assessment were conducted. The questionnaire
   includes situated learning, learning materials and operating
   interaction. The learning achievement was assessed by using the t-test
   for pre-test and post-test. The experiment shows that the system can
   indeed enhance users' learning interest and outcomes.},

Abstract = {According to aptitude theory, the measures of aptitude include not only
   cognitive factors but also affective factors (i.e., emotions) and
   conative factors (i.e., motivation) that can influence students'
   learning achievement (LA). Therefore, this study employed structural
   equation modelling from experimental data of 96 college students to
   investigate the effects of affective factors and conative factors on LA
   using online social network (OSN) attention as a moderating factor. The
   results confirmed that there are significant differences between student
   engagement and LA for overall group and student engagement, affective
   scores, and LA for the high OSN attention group. There are no
   significant differences for the low OSN attention group. Moreover,
   learning achievement can better facilitate the effects of the affective
   and conative levels for students with high rather than low OSN
   attention. In conclusion, the moderation of OSN attention shows that
   there are relationships that differ significantly across the high and
   low OSN attention groups.},

Abstract = {Interactive learning tools are emerging as effective educational
   materials in the area of computer science and engineering. It is a
   research domain that is rapidly expanding because of its positive
   impacts on motivating and improving students' performance during the
   learning process. This paper introduces an interactive learning
   environment for teaching and learning information and communication
   theory and related courses. The environment integrates several modules
   to meet the students' different learning styles. It contains a
   movie-like module, an animated hypertext introductory module that fully
   explains the fundamental concepts of information and communication
   theory. Besides those important learning modules, it also contains a
   self-assessment module that contains a set of interactive tests and
   examinations. Learners can use the environment as a standalone
   application or as an applet from within any web browser. Some evaluation
   experiments and comparative analyses of the results were performed to
   measure the performance of our environment in the classroom.},

Abstract = {To investigate student difficulties in solving word problems in algebra,
   we carried out a teaching experiment involving 51 Indonesian students
   (12/13 year-old) who used a digital mathematics environment. The
   findings were backed up by an interview study, in which eighteen
   students (13/14 year-old) were involved. The perspective of
   mathematization, i.e., the activity to transform a problem into a
   symbolic mathematical problem, and to reorganize the mathematical
   system, was used to identify student difficulties on the topic of linear
   equations in one variable. The results show that formulating a
   mathematical model-evidenced by errors in formulating equations, schemas
   or diagrams-is the main difficulty. This highlights the importance of
   mathematization as a crucial process in the learning and teaching of
   algebra.},

Abstract = {Science education research emphasizes the irreplaceable value of
   textbooks in students' acquisition of scientific knowledge.
   Illustrations such as diagrams contained in science books are crucial
   modes of visual representations that facilitate learners' conceptual
   learning. Through classifying, coding, and analysing diagrams from
   twenty science textbooks and workbooks used by Bahrain primary science
   curriculum, the aim of the study is to find out the distributional
   pattern and illustration characters of different diagrammatic types in
   the Bahrain's primary science books. Descriptive statistical analysis
   was carried out. A one-way ANOVA test was performed to check if there
   are any distributional differences between textbook and workbook
   categories. Findings of the study summarized the characteristics of
   diagrammatic usage in the Bahrain primary science books. The textbook
   analysis method used in the research also provided some insights for
   researchers interested in analysing the usage of diagrams and other
   illustrations in science learning contexts.},

Abstract = {Spatial panel data models have been widely studied and applied in both
   scientific and social science disciplines, especially in the analysis of
   spatial influence. In this paper, we consider the spatial dynamic
   nonparametric Durbin model (SDNDM) with fixed effects, which takes the
   nonlinear factors into account base on the spatial dynamic panel data
   models (SDPDM). Above all, we propose an iterative approach to estimate
   the spatial dynamic nonparametric Durbin model with corresponding
   hypothesis test and we find that convergence occurs since the second
   iteration. So we use a three stage iterative approach to improve the
   iterative approach. The results indicate that the three stage iterative
   approach is more reliable when T or N is large and the accuracy of the
   nonparametric components estimation is very important. We believe that
   the three stage iterative approach can be applied to other spatial
   dynamic nonparametric panel data models as well.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to reveal the pattern in a structure of
   teachers' instructional performance. Specifically, seven teachers'
   performances ( Standards and Objectives, Presenting Instructional
   Content, Lesson Structure and Pacing, Activities and Materials, Academic
   Feedback, Grouping Students, and Teacher Content Knowledge) were
   investigated. An embedded mixed methods approach analyzed 426 reports
   concerning 175 classroom-capturing videos. The findings showed a
   structured pattern and the relationships among the teachers'
   performances. Also, multiple group analysis was employed to examine the
   differences between beginning and experienced teachers' performance
   patterns. The beginning and experienced teachers presented different
   paths regarding the four performances: Activities and Materials,
   Grouping Students, Standards and Objectives, and Lesson Structure and
   Pacing. The findings of the current study have implications for teacher
   professional development.},

Abstract = {Recently, chess in school activities has attracted the attention of
   policy makers, teachers and researchers. Chess has been claimed to be an
   effective tool to enhance children's mathematical skills. In this study,
   931 primary school pupils were recruited and then assigned to two
   treatment groups attending chess lessons, or to a control group, and
   were tested on their mathematical problem-solving abilities. The two
   treatment groups differed from each other on the teaching method
   adopted: The trainers of one group taught the pupils heuristics to solve
   chess problems, whereas the trainers of the other treatment group did
   not teach any chess-specific problem-solving heuristic. Results showed
   that the former group outperformed the other two groups. These results
   foster the hypothesis that a specific type of chess training does
   improve children's mathematical skills, and uphold the idea that
   teaching general heuristics can be an effective way to promote transfer
   of learning.},

Abstract = {In such an era when the value is constantly restructured and information
   is rapidly changed, education reform should cater for new challenges.
   The role and function of teachers is encountering a new change. Coping
   with current information generation, people with high self-efficacy of
   selecting and mastering large amount of information and higher
   self-regulation ability are required for the instant change of knowledge
   and learning strategies. By distributing and collecting questionnaires
   on sites, students in the universities in Taiwan and Mainland China are
   sampled. Total 500 copies of questionnaires are distributed, and 378
   valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 76\%. The research
   results show 1. the effect of multiple goal orientation on learning
   motivation, 2. the effect of multiple goal orientation on learning
   behaviors, and 3.the remarkably positive effect of learning motivation
   on learning behaviors. The research outcomes are expected to be applied
   to the professional development and enhancement for teaching and
   training, promote the quality of education or training, and be the
   reference for education related sectors and research on organizational
   behaviors.},

Title = {Diagnosing Students' Misconceptions in Number Sense via a Web-Based
   Two-Tier Test},
Journal = {EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-55},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A web-based two-tier test (WTTT-NS) which combined the advantages of
   traditional written tests and interviews in assessing number sense was
   developed and applied to assess students' answers and reasons for the
   questions. In addition, students' major misconceptions can be detected.
   A total of 1,248 sixth graders in Taiwan were selected to participate in
   this study. Results showed that the average percentage of correct
   answers was about 45\%. Among the students who chose correct answers,
   about 22.9\% of them used a number sense method to solve problems. In
   addition, students' misconceptions are classified by content domains.
   The major contributions of the WTTT-NS are to (1) avoid students using
   written computations answering number sense questions; (2) present a
   whole picture of students' misconceptions and the weight of these
   misconceptions; (3) include the strengths of quantitative and
   qualitative methods; (4) identify students' ``true understanding{''} (a
   correct answer based on their correct understanding instead of guessing)
   by exploring reasons for their choices. In sum, the WTTT-NS is a new
   worthwhile method to assess students' number sense competence.},

   look into the relationship of the acceptance with understanding of
   evolutionary theory, parents' educational level, thinking dispositions
   and frequency of religious practising as independent variables by the
   use of studies conducted in both countries. Both studies found a
   correlation between students' understanding of evolutionary theory with
   acceptance of evolutionary theory, the same was recorded for religious
   practising and acceptance of evolution. A difference was observed in the
   case of contribution of parents' educational level and acceptance of
   evolution, where, we did not find any significant positive correlation
   between parents' educational level and acceptance of evolution, while
   that was true for Turkish society. Our findings with the comparative
   study of this type indicate that studying a controversial issue such as
   the acceptance of evolutionary theory in a multivariate fashion, using
   conceptual ecology as a theoretical lens to interpret the findings, is
   informative. They also, indicate the differences that exist from society
   to society and how sociocultural factors such as the type of religion as
   part of the conceptual ecology influence acceptance of evolution and
   have strong influence on evolution education.},

Abstract = {Chemistry is an important subject due to understanding the composition
   and structure of the things around us. The main aim of the study was to
   find out the perception of chemistry by lower secondary school pupils.
   The partial aims were to find out the influence of gender, year of study
   and favorite subject on the perception of chemistry. The sample size
   comprised 379 Czech lower secondary schools pupils. The questionnaire
   was used as a research tool. It consisted of 25 5-point Likert type
   items. Items were, after application of factor analysis, divided into
   four categories: 1. The interest in chemistry, 2. The relevance of
   chemistry, 3. The future life and chemistry, 4. Chemical aids and
   laboratory experiments. Reliability of the research tool was determined
   by Cronbach's alpha which had value alpha = 0.87). For the data
   evaluation the methods of inferential statistics were used, concretely
   analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pupils had low positive perception of
   chemistry. Statistically significant differences between boys and girls
   and also between 8th and 9th graders were not found out. In the
   conclusion part the possibilities of next research and also
   recommendations for practice are presented.},

Abstract = {Today's children are growing up in an environmentally damaged and
   technology orientated world. The advent and advances of technology, has
   resulted in the production of millions of electronic devices, which
   eventually become waste when they reach their end-of-life. These devices
   contain toxic components that are not only polluting the environment but
   can be dangerous to human health. A way forward will be to transfer the
   global problem of e-waste to educated individuals. The task is to equip
   young learners with the values, attitudes, knowledge and skills needed
   on how to manage e-waste and secure a healthy and a sustainable future
   for all. The qualitative study proposed curricula for a subject on
   environmentally sustainability (Grades four to seven).},

Abstract = {Citizens need the capability to conduct their own inquiry projects so
   that they can make sense of claims about new energy policies, health
   remedies, or financial opportunities. To develop the lifelong capability
   to grapple with these dilemmas, we report on ways to design precollege
   units that engage students in realistic, personally relevant
   investigations. Our investigations and syntheses of related work have
   resulted in the knowledge integration framework. This constructivist
   framework shows that, to succeed, learners build on what they know and
   use reasoning strategies to make sense of new information. To help
   designers we have identified a pattern that can guide instructional
   designers. The pattern involves supporting students to articulate their
   existing ideas, add new, normative ideas, distinguish them from their
   existing ideas, and reflect on their experiences as they increase the
   coherence of their ideas. To guide students, we are currently
   investigating automated guidance based on analysis of natural language
   essays students write while investigating complex problems such as
   global climate change.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore alignment between reform-based
   Turkish primary science curriculum and alternative assessment practices
   of a classroom teacher. Observational case study approach was utilized.
   A classroom teacher with 32 years of experience and his 31 students
   participated in the study. The data were collected during one academic
   year via classroom observations, teacher interviews, instructional
   materials and a science teaching belief instrument. Analysis of the data
   indicated that the teacher's use of traditional assessment activities
   was more dominant than alternative assessment activities although the
   latter was strongly emphasized by the curriculum. Moreover,
   implementation of alternative assessment activities was not in line with
   what the curriculum stated. Decisions of policy makers, lack of
   instructional time, exclusion of the curriculum by the teacher,
   inadequate pedagogical content knowledge and insufficient teacher
   training on assessment were found to be the elements that might have
   negatively affected the alignment negatively. Possible actions that may
   support a higher level of alignment were discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study, through the observation of mathematically promising
   students in regular classrooms, relevant learning environments and the
   learning needs of promising students, teacher approaches and teaching
   methods, and the differences between the promising students and their
   normal ability peers in the same classroom were investigated.
   Correlational survey research was conducted. The sample of this research
   was composed of selected and non-selected students. The selected
   students were 21 students who were attending the Science and Art Center
   in Erzincan. The non-selected students were peers of the selected
   students in the same classroom at their schools. The differentiated
   classroom observation form, which was adapted into Turkish, and written
   interview questions for teachers were the data collection instruments
   used in this study. Structured non participant observation was conducted
   in regular classrooms in which selected mathematically promising and
   their non-selected peers attended. The data collected through
   observation form were analyzed quantitatively through Mann Whitney U
   test and the data collected through teacher interviews were analyzed
   qualitatively through direct quoting. The findings of {*}the study
   suggest that the mathematically promising students were more active in
   classroom activities and communicated more frequently with their teacher
   compared to their normal ability peers. In contrast, their classroom
   respect levels were lower. The repetition of some topics and concepts,
   and not being praised enough may be counted as the reasons behind these
   disrespected behaviors.},

Abstract = {This study investigates CPD provision in Saudi Arabia by critically
   examining mathematics teachers' views on their experiences and their
   views on the impact of provision from a teacher-as-learner perspective.
   A questionnaire was administered to 605 teachers representing three
   educational administrations in Saudi Arabia (Mecca, Taif, and Majmah).
   The data was analyzed from a socio-cultural learning perspective with
   the intention of teasing out the assumptions about knowledge, learning
   and context that underpinned provision. There was tentative evidence
   that knowledge was typically conceptualized as a transferable commodity
   that could be imparted to teachers in ways that was intended to
   influence their professional practices and development. Yet, from the
   perspective of the majority of teachers, it failed to have a large
   impact on their practice beyond the immediate. Most teachers'
   descriptions of how they spent their CPD were deemed to be passive and
   subservient rather than active participation in knowledge creation or
   offering leadership to others. It was concluded that teacher learning is
   best facilitated through long term, practice-focused, community of
   practice-based provision and should encompass all activity in which a
   teacher feels they have learnt irrespective of whether it took place as
   part of their daily work or at a provided CPD event.},

Abstract = {Literature states that entrepreneurial awareness is required in
   countries where entrepreneurship is neither publicized nor acclaimed,
   which is currently the situation in South Africa. Entrepreneurial skills
   include the ability to market one's product by means of a sales poster
   while problem-based learning is viewed as fundamental to entrepreneurial
   education. The research question arises ``How may academics use
   problem-based learning to stimulate entrepreneurial awareness among
   senior African undergraduate students?{''} The purpose of this article
   is to present a practical assignment which was designed to help students
   think about entrepreneurship while engaging in problem-based learning.
   Engineering students were asked to help resolve the problem of poor
   television reception in the Vaal Triangle community by designing and
   constructing a specific antenna and then designing a sales poster to
   market their product. Quantitative and qualitative data reveals that
   students are able to engage in problem-based learning in engineering,
   but lack the ability to design an effective sales poster which forms
   part of entrepreneurial skills. Results further reveal that students
   were able to meet the learning outcomes for this practical assignment
   and really enjoyed the problem-based learning approach.},

Abstract = {Spanish students' beliefs on themes of Science-Technology-Society (STS)
   and nature of science (NOS) are assessed. The sample consisted of 1050
   science and non-science students who had concluded their pre-university
   education (18-19 years old). Each participant anonymously answered 30
   items drawn from the Questionnaire of Opinions on Science, Technology
   and Society, which were presented within two different booklets to cover
   the main STS-NOS issues. The students' direct responses were scaled by
   means of a multiple response model and a metric into a set of
   quantitative indices that represent the adequateness of the student's
   answer to current scholar knowledge on STS-NOS. The indices form the
   baseline variables on items, categories, and sentences for the
   quantitative and qualitative analyses of students' beliefs. The overall
   mean results display neutral positions, although a detailed scrutiny of
   the mean indices across items, categories, and sentences allows to
   pinpoint further rich details, such as the students' highest positive
   and lowest negative beliefs to be identified. The versatility of the
   method makes also possible to implement hypothesis testing, which in the
   present case do not find significant differences between science and
   non-science students. Some implications for research on the issues
   concerning the STS-NOS issues and its teaching and learning are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Physics teachers use experimental devices to show students how
   scientific concepts, principles, and laws are applied to understand the
   real world. This paper studies question generation of secondary and
   under-graduate university students when they are confronted with
   experimental devices in different but usual teaching situations: reading
   about devices while studying still images or diagrams, watching an
   experimental demonstration, and handling the devices in the laboratory.
   The influence of the prior scientific knowledge on the questions asked
   is also analysed. Inquiry learning environments, involving lab projects,
   seemed to stimulate more inferences addressed to causality when students
   tried to build mental models, whereas reading about devices with the
   help of still images stimulate more descriptive inferences and inhibited
   predictive ones.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine if middle school student
   scientific understanding could be predicted by the variables:
   standardized 5th grade score in science, standardized 5th grade score in
   mathematics, standardized 5th grade score in reading, student attitude
   towards science, socioeconomic status, gender, and ethnicity. An
   Attitude towards Science Survey (SATS) and a Survey of Scientific
   Understandings were administered to 116 middle school 8th grade students
   during the 2010-2011 school year. SES was a significant predictor of
   scientific understanding of middle school students since correlation
   results showed that only SES was a significant contributor to predicting
   scientific understanding of these students. Low SES students performed
   lower on the scientific understanding survey, on average, than high SES
   students. This study can be a source of information for teachers in
   low-income schools by recognizing potential areas of concern for
   low-income students in their science classrooms.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of e-learning, as
   a pedagogical tool, for changing initial conceptions when learning about
   physics by using the learning management System of the Moodle platform.
   Our study provides an empirical exploration of the pedagogical use of
   Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) in order to investigate a) the
   change of students' conception of fundamental issues in electricity and
   b) their attitudes towards the use of this LMS system. Analysis of
   questionnaire data shows a slight improvement in students' performance
   and this difference is associated with participants' conceptual
   understanding. Students had strong attitudes towards blended learning
   but this was not reflected upon their intention to further use the LMS,
   as expressed in responses to the TAM's questionnaire.},
