Abstract = {Mathematical modeling (MM) - a cyclical process that involves using
   mathematics to make-sense of and analyze relevant, real-world situations
   - has the potential to advance equity and challenge spaces of
   marginalization in the elementary mathematics classroom. When informed
   by culturally responsive teaching practices, MM creates opportunities to
   center the knowledge and experiences that students from diverse racial,
   cultural, and linguistic backgrounds bring to the classroom as valuable
   resources to support learning and inform action. It can disrupt power
   and status hierarchies in the classroom that contribute to structural
   and ideological marginalization. This paper describes ways teachers
   connected their teaching of MM with key components of a culturally
   responsive mathematics teaching framework. Analysis synthesizes data
   from an innovative, research-based professional development for
   elementary teachers to support teacher learning of equity-centered,
   culturally responsive MM instruction. Data sources include end of year
   teacher interviews, and professional development discussions from 19
   teachers at four geographically, racially, and culturally diverse sites.
   Findings focus on how teachers connected their teaching of MM with key
   dimensions of culturally responsive mathematics teaching, and
   affordances and challenges related to resisting ideological and
   structural forms of marginalization.},

Title = {Early numeracy opportunities through number stories with marginalised
   families},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 29},
Abstract = {We explore the potential of merging numeracy and literacy, through using
   number stories to stimulate mathematical engagement with young,
   marginalized learners in their communities. Our data emerges from the
   Family Maths Storytime Programme (FMSP) run in partnership with teachers
   in two South African schools. The FMSP conducted sessions with
   caregivers of pre-Grade 1 learners that focused on supporting
   mathematical talk in the home centred around four number storybooks with
   linked activities and games. Drawing on Bourdieu's notion of habitus and
   other socio-cultural theories emphasising opportunities for talk and
   reasoning for learning we explore: Did the FMSP enable the integration
   of home and school numeracy and literacy practices? If so, what evidence
   is there of such integrated practices? What is the nature of the
   described practices? Our analysis focuses on 20 caregiver interviews
   following their participation in the FMSP that was initially run after
   school in two English medium pre-Grade 1 classrooms. NVivo coding
   highlighted key themes across interviews. The findings show how
   modelling engagement with merged literacy and numeracy practices in the
   programme enabled changing practices, dispositions, and forms of capital
   in relation to engaging with these in the home. We highlight how
   supporting home-based and story inspired engagement with marginalised
   learners supports equity goals in contexts where learners from
   indigenous backgrounds often begin and remain mathematically behind
   grade expectations in school.},

Abstract = {In interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
   (STEM) education, empirical evidence is required that points to the
   educational contribution of mathematics. Specifically, researchers are
   not clear how mathematics weaves itself through the STEM education
   meta-discourse. This article contributes to pedagogical practices in
   educational institutions where STEM has been newly introduced - What are
   the perceptions and experiences of South African teachers on
   interdisciplinary STEM education, and how do mathematics and
   interdisciplinary STEM discourses leverage each other at schools of
   specialisation (SoS) in South Africa? Participant teachers were drawn
   from ten SoS in South Africa. SoS are STEM-dense schools in South
   Africa's Gauteng Province, the country's industrial and commercial hub.
   Interview data was collected on teachers' experiences and practices to
   explore the affordances of Mathematics and other STEM disciplines to
   influencing curriculum advancement. Situated cognition, mathematics as
   explorations and flow theory informed this qualitative study. In the
   findings, technology was regarded as raising learner motivation and
   mathematical achievement. Important to the study is that participants
   have a high regard for mathematics' role in interdisciplinary STEM
   education. In the study, teachers had no autonomy to pursue the STEM
   agenda, as they were bound to adhere to a prescribed curriculum, which
   hardly refers to implementation of interdisciplinary STEM education.
   Various recommendations are proffered, such as maintaining the positive
   perceptions participants have on the role of mathematics in STEM
   curricula. The research calls for equality and equity of all the STEM
   disciplines, as one STEM curricula cannot succeed without the other.},

Title = {``But this is not mathematics!{''}-mathematicians and secondary teachers
   explore the affordances of tertiary mathematics for teaching secondary
   probability},

Abstract = {Tertiary mathematics has a central place in teacher education, yet in
   recent years there is growing evidence that realizing its potential
   affordances in secondary mathematics teaching is far from trivial.
   Research suggests that utilizing tertiary mathematics in secondary
   teaching requires interweaving it with knowledge for teaching secondary
   mathematics. Little is known about the underlying processes, which are
   often tacit and highly personal. In this article we analyze affordances
   of tertiary mathematics for teaching secondary probability. A group of
   mathematicians and experienced secondary teachers jointly inquired into
   the mathematics that could be addressed in school when discussing a
   popular probability game - the River Crossing game (henceforth ``the
   game{''}). This context was chosen as an extreme case, in the sense that
   the mathematics underlying the game is so nuanced and complex that
   applying tertiary knowledge to mathematize and understand it is
   generally not feasible for secondary teachers. Thus, it is not clear how
   tertiary mathematics can inform teachers about using the game in class.
   Our analysis shows how the conflicting perspectives of teachers and
   mathematicians on what mathematics students may learn by playing the
   game initially hindered utilization of tertiary mathematics.
   Nevertheless, rapprochement was achieved, highlighting four different
   trajectories for interweaving knowledge of tertiary mathematics with
   knowledge for teaching secondary mathematics towards using the game in
   ingenious ways that respect both mathematical and pedagogical concerns.
   Our findings suggest that tertiary mathematics may have affordances for
   secondary mathematics teaching even in situations where teachers lack
   tertiary-level understanding of the underlying subject-matter.},

Abstract = {Future mathematics teachers must integrate their knowledge of
   mathematics, pedagogy, and learners to effectively teach mathematics.
   Historically, these different forms of knowledge were taught separately
   in teacher preparation and left to the preservice teacher to integrate
   on their own. This raises the question; what resources can be leveraged
   to promote knowledge integration in mathematics courses for teachers? In
   this study, we identified six instructional actions that were associated
   with potential knowledge integration when implemented within the
   environment of a mathematics course for preservice teachers. We posit
   these instructional actions can be implemented in concise and minimally
   invasive ways in a variety of mathematics content courses. Further
   unpacking of these instructional actions and considerations for
   implementation are provided.},

Abstract = {Translation is a critical issue in international mathematics education
   studies but has seldom been carefully investigated. How can a
   theoretical approach be translated and subsequently used in different
   languages, and to what extent could the translation processes deepen the
   approach itself? This paper addresses such issues in the case of the
   Documentational Approach to Didactics (DAD). We explore possibilities of
   translating selected critical notions expressed in English terms into
   French, Arabic and Chinese, and developing insights from these
   possibilities. We further deal with the translation issues `in situ',
   i.e. in an English mathematics teacher's lesson where we can identify
   the embodiments of the DAD concepts. The most challenging part in the
   translation is the embedding of the English terms in the English
   cultural sphere, and `re-bedding' them into another cultural sphere. It
   is claimed that examining the nuances between the different
   possibilities of translation for the same concept, in connection with
   their use `in situ', and drawing inspiration from the educational,
   cultural and theoretical traditions in other cultural spheres, can help
   to deepen the theoretical constructs.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we describe an experiment in using history to work on
   problem-solving and the relationship between arithmetic and algebra. The
   students involved attended the first year of the Italian upper secondary
   school (grade 9). The original sources we used are problems from Italian
   treatises on arithmetic and algebra that appeared in the Middle Ages and
   the Renaissance. At the beginning, we present these treatises, which
   belong to a widespread mathematical tradition. We then describe the
   classroom experiment: we administered 14 problems from ancient treatises
   accompanied by the request to solve them and write impressions and
   comments. Data were collected through written protocols and interviews.
   The analysis of the results focused on the strategies implemented in
   solving the problems, with particular reference to the use of arithmetic
   and algebra, and on the perception of the cultural aspect introduced by
   these problems in the students' approach to mathematics. The findings
   show the difficulties of some students on topics, such as fractions and
   direct proportionality, which should have been acquired in earlier
   school years. Combining the use of history with aspects of research in
   mathematics education allowed us to outline some teaching implications
   linked to the use of history.},

Abstract = {This article is a review of the literature on the use of history of
   mathematics in combination with use of digital technologies in the
   teaching and learning of mathematics. The review identifies 33
   peer-reviewed publications (book chapters, journal articles, and papers
   in conference proceedings) that address an actual interplay between use
   of history and digital technologies. Of these, 24 concern the use of
   primary historical source material, i.e., mathematical texts produced by
   past (historical) mathematicians. Besides asking the questions of which
   publications actually incorporate this interplay and what purposes the
   use of history and digital technology serve, we also address the
   question of the role of mathematics education theoretical perspectives
   (or the lack thereof) in the identified publications. A reading of the
   identified publications shows that the ones involving use of primary
   historical source material often have a clearer connection to
   theoretical constructs from mathematics education research (outside the
   area of History and Pedagogy of Mathematics, or HPM). Still, only a
   small number of the identified publications make use of mathematics
   education theoretical constructs specifically addressing the use of
   digital technology.},

Abstract = {In this study the research was focused on the mechanisms of how Chinese
   in-service teachers' beliefs about mathematics, together with their
   professional knowledge, affect their teaching approaches. With a
   quantitative survey study involving 92 in-service teachers, it
   identified six types of teachers with three different categories of
   beliefs (i.e., Instrumentalist, Platonist, and Problem-solving oriented)
   and two different levels (i.e., strong and limited) of subject knowledge
   and pedagogical content knowledge on the topic of functions. Six
   teachers were subsequently selected, for a detailed analysis of how the
   teachers' beliefs and knowledge influenced their teaching practices. The
   case study results showed that teachers with different professional
   knowledge levels about functions and beliefs about mathematics had
   different teaching focuses and showed different teaching approaches.
   Three teaching approaches were identified, including the
   performance-focused content-centered approach, the understanding-focused
   content-centered approach, and the thinking-focused student-centered
   approach.},

Abstract = {We discuss classroom activity comprised of small groups of students
   collaboratively tinkering with programs of dynamically manipulable
   figural models, posing problems regarding their mathematical properties
   and behaviors. We analyzed data from students' discourse taken from two
   classroom interventions employing a framework of creative mathematical
   action-in-context, in order to study student-generated ideas. We
   approached students' actions taking a fallible mathematics
   epistemological approach and employed constructionist and social
   creativity theory in our analysis. Our results show that student agency
   in the disciplined field of mathematical thinking need not curtail the
   potential for undisciplined creative action: on the contrary, given
   appropriate tools and discursive environments it may in fact create
   space for actions with creative potential for students. On their own
   accord, the students in the study used generalized number theory to
   resolve engineering a parallelogram that can never be a rectangle, and
   used recursion to program a model embedding geometrical progression in
   order to create a spiral based on the golden ratio.},

Abstract = {In this paper we discuss students' opportunities to learn to pose
   mathematical problems, based on a historical analysis of problem posing
   in the area of number and algebra in six series of Chinese primary
   school mathematics textbooks published since the 1950s. We examine
   changes in the proportion and distribution of the problem-posing tasks,
   and in the presentation of the problem-posing tasks. Our results show a
   decreasing number of problem-posing tasks as grade level increases, even
   though problem posing has become more important in mathematics education
   in China during the last 70 years. This study also provides a variety of
   examples of problem-posing tasks which could serve as a reference for
   teachers in other countries in designing and employing problem-posing
   tasks in the classroom.},

Title = {Towards a research base for textbooks as teacher support: the case of

Abstract = {Engaging students in processes of mathematizing and active knowledge
   organization (instead of telling and rehearsing ready-made mathematics)
   is a key demand for high quality mathematics instruction. Although many
   mathematically rich context problems have been designed and published in
   textbooks, their impact on regular mathematics classrooms remains
   limited, as teachers face challenges in shaping and enacting the
   important phase of knowledge organization. The 15-year project KOSIMA
   presented in this paper was aimed at supporting teachers in really
   enhancing these processes by means of a textbook for Grades 5-10. The
   paper provides an overview of different studies conducted during the
   project in order to show how the project developed a research base for
   the support of teachers. The paper also shows that different research
   approaches need to be combined to establish an appropriate research
   base: In iterative design research cycles of topic-specific didactical
   design research, learning environments were designed and investigated
   with the aim of understanding the obstacles encountered in implementing
   the desired processes. In this paper, we focus on an example of one
   particular obstacle, namely, teachers' need of support in engaging
   students in processes of active knowledge organization. This obstacle
   was overcome by developing new types of tasks for active knowledge
   organization. The theoretical outcome of the design research resulted in
   two hypotheses for improving relevant features of the design of these
   tasks, which were tested in two controlled trials. Finally, a
   longitudinal field study of 312 students gave first indications that the
   classes that worked with the textbook had significantly higher learning
   gains than classes using other textbooks. In sum, we can show that
   textbooks can support changes in classroom practices when the obstacles
   that occur for both teachers and students are carefully investigated and
   treated.},

Abstract = {For a long time, Soviet students learned `pure' mathematics in their
   mathematics classrooms, while applications of mathematics were
   introduced in their science (mainly physics) classrooms. This approach
   was a part of a uniform and rigid national curriculum. Even when in the
   1990s the world was moving towards including applications in school
   mathematics, Russian students continued to engage in pure mathematics
   learning in their mathematics classrooms. It was physics teachers'
   responsibility to teach applications of mathematics; therefore, physics
   courses were highly mathematics-intensive, making extensive use of
   mathematics from algebra to calculus in the formulation of scientific
   laws and the investigation of their consequences. The collapse of the
   Soviet Union and some liberalization in educational policy led to
   changes in graduation requirements in mathematics and physics as well as
   diversity in mathematics and physics curricula in schools. Based on a
   review of textbooks, standards, curriculum documents, and other
   resources, in this paper we analyze changes that affected the teaching
   and learning of mathematics in physics classrooms in Russia from the
   Soviet period to the present.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the outcomes of a 4-year implementation of a
   mathematics program (Representations, oral language and engagement in
   Mathematics: RoleM) for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island
   students' learning of mathematics across the first 4 years of primary
   school (Foundation-Year 3). It specifically aims to determine how
   engagement in teaching and learning mathematics changes as beginning
   teachers and student participate in the RoleM project. Data were
   collected from teachers across the 4 years of the RoleM project who were
   working in schools with young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
   students. This paper draws on data from 22 beginning teachers (in their
   first 3 years of teaching) who participated in three semi-structured
   interviews. Findings indicate that the relationship between the
   constructs of engagement are potentially on a continuum, with changes in
   teacher perspectives of their own engagement and students' engagement
   acting in a synchronised manner.},

Abstract = {Lesson study (LS) is a form of professional development, with a strong
   foundation in mathematics education, based on teachers collaborating to
   design lessons. This collaboration, however, can be challenging for
   isolated teachers. In 2017, a course was presented at the university to
   train 52 teachers from all over South Africa as well as Botswana in the
   use of technology in teaching. These teachers represented all subject
   fields, including mathematics. The purpose of this course was to develop
   teachers' knowledge and skills in the use and integration of mobile
   technology in their teaching. The course was presented in a blended
   mode. Participants attended a 3-day face-to-face session, followed by
   2-months online. The blended learning course had teachers working in
   subject specific groups in a LS format to plan, present and perfect
   lessons that can be taught using the technology available to them. In
   this study we investigate how LS can be adapted into a blended format to
   support isolated teachers who cannot meet face-to-face on a regular
   basis. We identified eleven aspects playing an important role in this
   process, namely technology; group; learning management system; online
   facilitation; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK);
   (mobile) learning strategies; a lesson planning form; backward design;
   time; photos, videos and reports; and reflection questions. The eleven
   aspects that emerged, lead to the development of a framework consisting
   of three dimensions of LS namely Collaboration, Instructional
   Development and the Iterative Improvement Process, supported by the
   identified aspects.},

Abstract = {The focus of this article is the well documented association between low
   working memory capacity and difficulty with mathematical word-problem
   solving. We begin by describing a model that specifies how various
   cognitive resources, including working memory, contribute to individual
   differences in word-problem solving and by then summarizing findings on
   the relation between working memory and word-problem solving. This sets
   the context for the article's main purpose and major section: to
   describe the findings of research studies that take one of two
   approaches for addressing the needs of students with low working memory
   within word-problem solving intervention. One approach focuses on
   compensating for working memory limitations; the other on building
   working memory capacity. We then suggest the need for research on
   integrating the two approaches by embedding working memory training
   within explicit word-problem solving intervention.},

Abstract = {Drawing on students' language repertoires for conjecture, we here focus
   on communication acts to consider students' mathematical identities in
   action. Our attention to authority and positioning in mathematics
   classrooms led us to interrogate the intertwined nature of discourses
   and how they may make identities available. We use an interaction among
   a group of grade ten students in a problem-solving situation to
   illustrate and develop our conceptualization of identities in contexts
   of intertwining discourses. We consider how the participants position
   themselves in relation to each other, to mathematics, and to other
   available discourses, and we ask how their communication acts might
   serve their purposes within the discourses. We discuss the implications
   of intertwined discourses for students' developing identities when
   communicating in a mathematical context. We argue that one cannot
   understand students' mathematical identities without understanding that
   their communication acts are also part of their repertoires for a range
   of discourses. This motivates intentional work to support the
   development of identities accessing available discourses in mathematics
   learning.},

Title = {Theorising the place of emotion-cognition in research on mathematical

Abstract = {In this paper, we offer a theoretical account of the emotion-cognition
   dialectic (i.e. the unit of feeling and cognition in thought) in
   identity formation (or identification), focusing on early childhood and
   mathematics. We consider how contradictory (emotional-cognitive)
   experiences which arise in different forms of mathematical activity (a
   mathematical play activity versus formal classroom mathematics) produce
   and are produced by contradictory acts of mathematical identification.
   We illustrate this perspective using the case of Daniel (aged 6 years)
   who expressed the emotion of astonishment' at seeing himself on video
   engaged in a play activity. We highlight how this experience of
   emotion-cognition enables Daniel to articulate a juxtaposition between
   play that is `fun' and his classroom mathematics thatmakes him tired',
   which we associate with contrasting mathematical identifications. This
   recognises that social/cultural symbolic forms of emotion-cognition and
   identification are present in dialogue with others/adults even at this
   young age. We therefore, call for a research agenda that explores how
   such identifications might become sedimented into mathematical
   identities as the child develops.},

Abstract = {We present exploratory analyses of three cases in which groups of four
   (quartets) worked with video recordings of choreographed performances
   from the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. We asked
   quartets to view the recordings, explain what performers were doing by
   reenacting what they noticed in the video, and create their own
   performances using props akin to those in the recording. In response,
   participants explored symmetries and transformations of quadrilaterals
   and triangles. We contribute to research on distributed, embodied
   mathematical learning at four levels. First, we argue for design
   research that engages in creative re-use by foraging in public media for
   performances with mathematical potential, then designing activities that
   invite learners to dissect and reenact these performances to explore
   that potential. Second, we analyze quartets' work as a form of ensemble
   learning that hybridizes dance and mathematics. Third, we describe
   interactions that produced intercorporeality in the material work of
   quartets. Finally, we argue for reenactment as a supplement to methods
   of Interaction Analysis, using our own analysis as an illustration of
   this novel approach.},

Abstract = {The way in which mathematics is communicated and represented in schools
   (including the written language, symbols and diagrams of mathematics
   textbooks and the verbal/spoken classroom interaction itself) constructs
   particular views of the nature of mathematics and expectations about
   students' participation in mathematical activity. In a previous article,
   we developed an analytic framework for examining the nature of
   mathematics and mathematical activity in textbooks in Palestinian
   schools and England. Here we extend our analysis to include the
   verbal/spoken language in two classrooms. To illustrate the application
   of the suggested framework, we present three cases from a particular
   social context (Palestine). We analyse an instance of a written textbook
   for grade 7 and spoken discourse in two classes in grades 5 and 6. We
   show how studying written and spoken discourse enables us to draw a
   picture of mathematics, mathematical activities and learning mathematics
   in schools context.},

Abstract = {Equity is an important element of educational discourses pertaining to
   mathematics and science education. Creativity is an aspect of the
   classroom that is often ignored due to curricular constraints and the
   burden of testing. However mathematics offers avenues to infuse the
   regular curricula with activities that are thought provoking and require
   creativity and these are accessible to learners of all levels. This
   article reviews creativity strategies that can be embedded in
   mathematics curricula to increase classroom equity. These strategies
   will include the strength of presenting open-ended problems, modeling
   and encouraging risk taking, discussions and debate of mathematical
   concepts, concept based learning, divergent thinking strategies during
   problem solving activities, and incorporating cultural awareness and
   creativity into curricula and classroom environment. The article will
   focus both on teacher implementation of these strategies and student
   outcomes regarding creativity and equity.},

Abstract = {We explore questions around the design, development, and dissemination
   of digital curriculum materials, the perspectives in these areas, and
   how these perspectives align with broader discourses in education. We
   identify and briefly describe four perspectives: (1) designer
   perspective; (2) policy perspective; (3) private sector perspective
   (e.g., publishers and philanthropists); and (4) user (teachers and
   schools) perspective. We discuss how these perspectives converge and
   diverge by looking at the different features of curriculum materials
   emphasized by each perspective and the reasons for these emphases. The
   discussion and findings speak to the promise of digital programs as well
   as limitations related to the rationales related to the development,
   dissemination and use of digital curriculum resources. The emergence of
   a dominant perspective speaks to broader concerns about educational
   priorities being formulated according to a market-based rationality.},

Abstract = {The study investigated the effects of using the problem of the week in
   teaching (POWT) on teachers' learning and changes in knowledge and
   teaching skills, in algebraic thinking and algebra tasks, in the setting
   of a university mathematics education graduate program. The graduate
   students participated in learning POWT weekly in a mathematics education
   course, which tasked the students to solve a problem, address the
   concept of the problem, discuss teaching the concept of the problem with
   conceptual understanding, and explain their reasoning. Data collection
   included weekly collection of student work on POWT. The one-way within
   subject analysis of variance was used to analyze the teachers' growth
   and change in their knowledge and teaching skills in algebraic thinking
   and in algebra, reflected in their performance on the POWTs. The
   differences in the knowledge, and skills changes, were compared within
   each POWT and across all POWTs. The results show that the teachers
   enhanced their knowledge and teaching skills in problem solving,
   conceptual understanding and teaching methods as a result of doing the
   POWTs.},

Abstract = {Implementation has always been a paramount concern of mathematics
   education, but only recently has the conceptualizing and theorizing work
   on implementation as a phenomenon begun in our field. In this survey
   paper, we conduct a hermeneutic review of mathematics education research
   identified as related to the implementation problematics. The first
   cycle of the review is based on examples of studies published in
   mathematics education journals during the last 40 years. It is organized
   according to five reasons for developing implementation research. The
   second cycle concerns 15 papers included in this special issue and is
   organized by four themes, as follows: objects of implementation,
   stakeholders in implementation, implementation vs. scaling up, and
   implementability of mathematics education research. The paper is
   concluded with a refined glossary of implementation-related terms and
   suggestions for future research.},

Abstract = {This study concerns a professional development course designed and
   implemented for prospective teachers, centred on a teaching method
   regarding problem-solving activity, namely, the Thinking Classroom. The
   study is framed in the theory of cultural transposition, a perspective
   about the encounter with teaching practices from different
   cultural/school contexts. Cultural aspects are considered crucial and
   this encounter between cultures is seen as an opportunity for actors to
   become aware of their own unthoughts, i.e., some of the `invisible'
   cultural beliefs about teaching and learning absorbed by their own
   culture. According to this framework, we present the results from a
   questionnaire given to all the participants, and two case studies of
   prospective teachers involved in the professional development, in order
   to discuss the kind of unthoughts on which they have focused in thinking
   about this training experience.},

Title = {Examining primary students' mathematical problem-solving in a

Abstract = {This paper reports on a design-based study within the context of a 3-day
   digital making (DM) summer camp attended by a group of students (aged
   11-13) in grades 5 and 6. During the camp, students were presented with
   a set of mathematical problems to solve in a block-based programming
   environment, which was connected to various physical input sensors and
   output devices (e.g., push buttons, LED lights, number displays, etc.).
   Students' code files, and screen captures of their computer work, were
   analyzed in terms of their developed computational problem-solving
   practices and any computational concepts that emerged during the
   problem-based DM. The results suggested that the designed tasks
   consistently supported the students' modeling and algorithmic thinking,
   while also occasioning their testing and debugging practices; moreover,
   the students utilized computational abstractions in the form of
   variables, and employed different approaches, to formulate mathematical
   models in a programming context. This study contributes to the `big
   picture' of how using computers might fundamentally change mathematics
   learning, with an emphasis on mathematical problem-solving. It also
   provides empirically grounded evidence to enhance the potential of
   computational thinking as a new literacy, and problem-solving as a
   global competence, in formal school settings.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the integrated use of the arts and digital
   technology in mathematics education-specifically involving aspects of
   preservice teachers' mathematical activity while engaging in music
   production, in pedagogic scenarios conceived of as aesthetic
   mathematical experiences (AMEs). Theoretically, the research evokes
   notions such as digital mathematical performance, aesthetics,
   humans-with-media, and musical theory. Methodologically, the study
   presents a pedagogic model for mathematics teaching and learning through
   music production; the model is elaborated using qualitative case studies
   in which preservice teachers (education majors and mathematics majors)
   created mathematical songs with music software. In their songs, the
   education majors explored place value and the mathematics majors
   explored progressions. The research highlights the mathematical ideas
   and the narrative nature of the lyrics, as well as the digital structure
   of the songs created collectively. The study also emphasizes aspects of
   thinking-with-music-software related to musical concepts such as
   intervals, note values, and harmonic fields. The results reveal that the
   AMEs offered ways for preservice teachers to think mathematically and
   aesthetically through the composition of the lyrics and by the creation
   of virtual instruments with music software.},

Abstract = {This research addressed Hungarian pre-service and in-service (both
   elementary and lower secondary) teachers' pedagogical content knowledge
   concerning the teaching of word problem solving strategies. By means of
   a standardized interview protocol, participants (N = 30) were asked
   about their judgement on the difficulty of teaching word problems, the
   factors they find difficult, and their current teaching practice.
   Furthermore, based on a comparative analysis of Eastern European
   textbooks, we tested how teachers' current beliefs and views relate to
   the word problem solving algorithm described in elementary textbooks.
   The results suggest that in the teachers' opinion, explicit teaching of
   a step-by-step algorithm is feasible and desirable as early as in the
   1st school grade. According to our results, two approaches (namely,
   paradigmatic- and narrative-oriented) concerning how to teach the
   process of word problems solving, originally revealed by Chapman, were
   found. Furthermore, teachers in general agreed with the approach taken
   in the textbooks on the subject of what kinds of word problems should be
   used, and that explicit teaching of word problem solving strategies
   should be introduced by using simple, routine word problems as examples.},

Abstract = {Blended learning, which combines face-to-face workshops with
   self-directed online learning, is becoming a good alternative in
   designing and deploying professional development programs. The online
   component adapts to teachers' time constraints, requires fewer trained
   professionals for its implementation, and enhances participants'
   opportunities to engage in the exploration and visualization of
   mathematical concepts and ideas. Also, the face-to-face component of
   this instruction modality allows spontaneous communication and
   collaborative construction of knowledge in real settings. This paper
   describes the instructional model of Suma y Sigue, a b-learning
   professional development program for primary and middle school teachers,
   which has been designed and implemented in Chile since 2015, aimed at
   developing mathematical knowledge for teaching. A particular feature of
   the program is its high-degree of self-directed autonomous online
   learning. We discuss how contextualized situations are articulated to
   create a learning environment in which teachers get involved in a
   progressive construction of multiple components of this knowledge. We
   also describe the implementation of the program, discussing the effects
   of scaling in teachers' experiences, and also how the information
   gathered upon implementation has led to changes in the training of
   instructors and in the program's instructional design.},

Abstract = {The relevancy of linear algebra (LA) in different areas and also the
   difficulties faced by undergraduate engineering students studying this
   content are well known. Grounded on this premise, we aimed at
   articulating papers related to the teaching and learning of LA in
   engineering undergraduate programs through a mapping of the main
   investigations on the teaching and learning of LA carried out since
   2000, by the Work Group Mathematical Education in Higher Education,
   associated with the Brazilian Society of Mathematical Education (SBEM),
   together with work produced between 2007 and 2018 by other Latin
   American studies on this subject in Mathematical Education societies
   with a representation similar to that of SBEM. We focused specifically
   on the link between the content of LA and that studied in specific
   courses. Methodologically, we followed the principles of Content
   Analysis and, based on a body of eight papers, we noted the following:
   (1) examples of situations through which it is possible to establish
   links between LA and contexts of engineering; (2) the role played out by
   the Technologies of Information and Communication (TIC) in the
   implementation of these links; (3) the importance of the concepts of
   eigenvalue and eigenvector in the resolution of problems of engineering;
   (4) the need to facilitate the mobilization of students to use different
   registers of semiotic representation, while working with the concepts of
   LA; (5) the importance of reflecting upon the (initial and continued)
   training of teachers who teach LA in engineering and ultimately, (6) the
   use of links between LA and contexts of engineering as an element of
   motivation for students and for their recognition of when to use them.},

Abstract = {In times of rapid technological innovation and global challenges, the
   development of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
   competencies becomes important. They improve the personal scientific
   literacy of citizens, enhance international economic competitiveness and
   are an essential foundation for responsible citizenship, including the
   ethical custodianship of our planet. The latest programme for
   international student assessment results, however, indicate that even in
   economically mature countries such as those in Europe, and the USA and
   Australia, approximately 20\% of students lack sufficient skills in
   mathematics or science. This trend serves to highlight the urgent need
   for action in relation to STEM education. While it is widely
   acknowledged that mathematics underpins all other STEM disciplines,
   there is clear evidence it plays an understated role in integrated STEM
   education. In this article, we address an element of this concern by
   examining the role of mathematics within STEM education and how it might
   be advanced through three interdisciplinary approaches: (1) twenty-first
   century skills; (2) mathematical modelling; and (3) education for
   responsible citizenship. At the end of the paper we discuss the
   potential for research in relation to these three aspects and point to
   what work needs to be done in the future.},

Title = {Metacognition in mathematics: do different metacognitive monitoring
   measures make a difference?},

Abstract = {Metacognitive monitoring in educational contexts is typically measured
   by calibration indicators, which are based on the correspondence between
   cognitive performance and metacognitive confidence judgment. Despite
   this common rationale, a variety of alternative methods are used in the
   field of monitoring research to assess performance and judgment data and
   to calculate calibration indicators from them. However, the impact of
   these methodological differences on the partly incongruent picture of
   monitoring research has hardly been considered. Thus, the goal of the
   present study is to examine the effects of methodological choices in the
   context of mathematics education. To do so, the study compares the
   effects of two judgment scales (Likert scale vs. visual analogue scale),
   two response formats (open-ended response vs. closed response format),
   the information base of judgment (prospective vs. retrospective), and
   students' achievement level on confidence judgments. Secondly, the study
   contrasts measures of three calibration constructs, namely absolute
   accuracy (Absolute Accuracy Index, Hamann Coefficient), relative
   accuracy (Gamma, d'), and diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and
   specificity). One hundred and nine seventh-grade students completed a
   set of 20 mathematical problems and rated their confidence in a correct
   solution for each problem prospectively and retrospectively. Our results
   show a pervasive overconfidence of students across achievement levels.
   Monitoring was more precise for retrospective judgments and the visual
   analogue scale format. Gamma, sensitivity, and specificity proved to be
   susceptible for boundary values, caused by the general overconfidence in
   the sample. Measures of absolute accuracy were affected by response
   format of the task and judgment scale, with higher accuracy found for
   closed response format and visual analogue scale. We observed
   substantial correlations within the three calibration constructs and
   comparably low correlations between indicators of different constructs,
   confirming three interrelated aspects of monitoring accuracy. The low
   correlations between corresponding prospective and retrospective
   calibration indicators suggest different calibration processes.
   Implications for studies on calibration and mathematics education are

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine historically the onto-epistemological
   framework of mathematics education that generates cultural theses about
   modes of life. We pursue the idea of able bodies to think about
   schooling as producing kinds of people as well as their differences and
   divisions despite efforts for inclusion. Two historical moments in
   United States mathematics education are examined: pre-post WWII and
   contemporary reforms. We explore each moment as a set of cultural
   practices about who the child is and should be, and argue that making
   the body able embodies normalizing, and pathologizing qualities of being
   and acting. These practices change over time as we illustrate in these
   two historical moments. Shifting pedagogical practices reconfigure but
   never fully stabilize the desire to achieve a mathematically capable
   society through making up able bodies as inscriptions of the curriculum.
   Continual depiction of mathematical bodies on a differentially abled
   continuum in the so-called `unity' of all children makes visible how
   inclusive curriculum practices in mathematics education simultaneously
   create unlivable lives that are seen and re-formed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to use historical textbooks to explore the
   number line, a mathematical object common to our time, contextualizing
   its use during its initial development period in the seventeenth century
   until its current use as in the nineteenth century. Relevant analytic
   geometry textbooks are explored, mainly from France and from Germany of
   that time, to understand when and how this notion was used.
   Additionally, pertinent entries from encyclopedias of that time are used
   to contrast with what was not sufficiently explained in the
   aforementioned textbooks, until, finally, we can identify this object as
   it is currently characterized. I analyze how the negative numbers were
   used to constitute the number line and survey several number line
   diagrams, which were sometimes similar, but most often quite different
   from each other. The intention is to understand the historical contexts
   that configure the emergence and development of the notion of the number
   line.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine how a sequence of modeling activities
   supported the development of students' interpretations and reasoning
   about phenomena with negative average rates of change in different
   physical phenomena. Research has shown that creating and interpreting
   models of changing physical phenomena is difficult, even for university
   level students. Furthermore, students' reasoning about models of
   phenomena with negative rates of change has received little attention in
   the research literature. In this study, 35 students preparing to study
   engineering participated in a 6-week instructional unit on average rate
   of change that used a sequence of modeling activities. Using an analysis
   of the students' work, our results show that the sequence of modeling
   activities was effective for nearly all students in reasoning about
   motion with negative rates along a straight path. Almost all students
   were successful in constructing graphs of changing phenomena and their
   associated rate graphs in the contexts of motion, light dispersion and a
   discharging capacitor. Some students encountered new difficulties in
   interpreting and reasoning with negative rates in the contexts of light
   dispersion, and new graphical representations emerged in students' work
   in the context of the discharging capacitor with its underlying
   exponential structure. The results suggest that sequences of modeling
   activities offer a structured approach for the instruction of advanced
   mathematical content.},

Abstract = {This article explores 6th-grade students' modelling with data in
   generating models for selecting an Australian swimming team for the
   (then) forthcoming 2016 Olympics, using data on swimmers' times at
   various previous events. We propose a modelling framework comprising
   four components: working in shared problem spaces between mathematics
   and statistics; interpreting and reinterpreting problem contexts and
   questions; interpreting, organising and operating on data in model
   construction; and drawing informal inferences. In studying students'
   model generation, consideration is given to how they interpreted,
   organised, and operated on the problem data in constructing and
   documenting their models, and how they engaged in informal inferential
   reasoning. Students' responses included applying mathematical and
   statistical operations and reasoning to selected variables, identifying
   how variation and trends in swimmers' performances inform model
   construction, recognising limitations in using only one performance
   variable, and acknowledging uncertainty in model creation and model
   application due to chance variation.},

Abstract = {Recognizing the roles of mathematics in society is an important goal for
   the teaching and learning of mathematical modelling. The Likert-scales
   method is a simple and effective tool to assess student appreciation
   about the utility of mathematics; however, it does not reveal the
   detailed aspects of student perceptions of the roles of mathematics in
   society. This study aimed to answer the following research question: how
   can we assess the detailed aspects of student perceptions of the roles
   of mathematics in society? An analytical tool consisting of three
   viewpoints, namely, (1) personal-societal perspectives, (2) clarity of
   role statements, and (3) specific-general contexts, was developed. It
   was revealed that students' perceptions of the roles of mathematics in
   society significantly changed between the phases before and after an
   experimental teaching program. Namely, the analytical tool developed and
   used in this study enabled, at least partially, the clarification of the
   states or changes of students' perceptions of the roles of mathematics
   in society. Although further attention is required to improve the
   validity and reliability of the analytical tool, the present study
   encourages future research on this important topic.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an international research study of long-term
   professional development courses on modelling. It addresses the question
   of scaling-up professional development. So far, there has been much
   research on small-scale professional development courses, but we know
   very little about what it means to scale up such a course and to reach
   out to large numbers of teachers. Therefore, our study researches the
   impact of a scaled up professional development course on teachers and
   their teaching, as perceived by the teachers themselves and their
   students. The course was designed on an international level for use in
   12 countries. The results show that such a course can indeed lead to
   desired outcomes concerning the teachers and their teaching, and the
   research therefore adds to our understanding of scaling-up.},

Abstract = {This paper presents issues related to the use of technology by secondary
   school pre-service mathematics teachers engaged in open mathematical
   modelling projects. Pre-service teachers developed these projects within
   a regular mathematics education course during the teacher education
   program at the university concerned. This environment, called a
   modelling scenario, is the context for our study, which is based on the
   analysis of projects produced by seven consecutive cohorts of
   pre-service teachers beginning in 2010. The research questions guiding
   our study seek to determine which technologies pre-service teachers
   chose, for which modelling purposes they chose them, and in which phases
   of the modelling process they were significantly used. During the
   modelling process, pre-service teachers used the Internet, spreadsheets,
   mathematical software and programming languages. The Internet, the most
   utilized technology, was used to find information or data, to select
   variables, or to formulate problems. The other three technologies
   significantly influenced the processes of mathematical solution and
   validation. The in-depth analysis of a single project shows an original
   use of visual affordances of technologies and a dialectical relationship
   between problem posing and technology use. The study enables us to
   conclude the necessity for coordinated action between mathematics
   educators and mathematicians to generate a deeper understanding of
   modelling as a pedagogical proposal and mathematical activity.},

Abstract = {In this conceptual review paper we draw on recent literature with
   respect to digital curriculum resources (DCR); we briefly outline and
   explain selected theoretical frames; and we discuss issues related to
   the design, and the use (by teachers and students) of digital curricula
   and e-textbooks in mathematics education. The results of our review show
   the following. Firstly, whilst there are some contrasting tendencies
   between research on instructional technology and research on DCR, these
   studies are at the same time predominantly framed by socio-cultural
   theories. Secondly, whilst there seems to be a continuing demarcation
   between the design(er) and the use(r), there is at the same time an
   emerging/increasing understanding that design continues in use, due to
   the different nature and affordances of DCR (as compared to traditional
   text curriculum resources). Thirdly, there is an apparent weakening of
   traditional demarcations between pedagogy and assessment, and between
   summative and formative assessment techniques, due to the nature and
   design of the automated learning systems. Fourthly, there is an
   increasing need for understanding the expanded space of interaction
   associated with the shift from static print to dynamic/interactive DCR,
   a shift that has the potential to support different forms of
   personalised learning and interaction with resources. Hence, we claim
   that DCR offer opportunities for change: of understandings concerning
   the design and use of DCR; of their quality; and of the processes
   related to teacher/student interactions with DCR-they provide indeed the
   foundations for change.},

Abstract = {Teacher emotions are of growing interest in educational research, but
   empirical findings are still scarce. In their recent model illustrating
   the possible causes and effects of teacher emotions, Frenzel and
   colleagues argue that emotions are driven by subjective appraisals of
   success and failure. Specifically, these authors propose that teachers
   judge their teaching success based on specific dimensions of student
   behaviors (output orientation). Moreover, there are multiple models on
   instructional quality detailing which teacher behaviors characterize
   successful teaching (input orientation). To date, however, it is unknown
   how and when teachers themselves appraise their teaching as successful.
   To gain insight into teachers' appraisals of success, 307 mathematics
   teachers responded to an open-ended question about their criteria for
   math teaching success. Results showed that teachers' responses could be
   organized into six categories that mapped partly onto Frenzel's
   output-oriented model and partly onto the input-oriented instructional
   quality literature: (1) students' mathematical skills, (2) students'
   engagement, (3) students' social skills, (4) cognitive activation and
   structured presentation of the learning content, (5) structured
   organization of the learning environment and (6) feedback. These
   findings highlight student behavior, teacher behavior and feedback as
   key sources for mathematics teachers' subjective definitions of
   successful teaching and ultimately their emotional lives in the
   mathematics classroom.},

Abstract = {Children's worrying about their academic performance has profound
   implications for their learning and wellbeing in school. Understanding
   the contextual and psychological antecedents of students' worry thus
   represents an important area of research. Drawing on Eccles and
   colleagues' expectancy-value theory and Pekrun's control-value theory
   and using data from the Childhood and Beyond Study, we examined the
   motivational underpinnings of elementary students' worries about
   performing poorly in the domains of mathematics and reading (N = 805,
   grades 3, 4 and 6). With one exception, the analyses confirmed that
   children's expectations of success in and valuing of mathematics and
   reading interacted in predicting children's worry about these domains.
   Children's worry was strongest when they rated their subjective
   abilities and expected success in mathematics and reading as relatively
   low but perceived these subjects as valuable. Moderated mediation
   analyses further suggested that when children's self-concepts of
   mathematics and reading ability were low to moderate, students'
   perceived parental valuing of their performance in these subjects
   indirectly positively predicted children's worry via its positive impact
   on children's own subjective valuing of mathematics and reading. Thus,
   when children perceive high academic performance as potentially
   difficult to attain, perceived parental valuing might negatively impact
   their wellbeing in school (by increasing not only their valuing of
   mathematics and reading, but also their performance-related worrying).
   Children's gender, grade level, teacher-rated mathematics and reading
   aptitude, and prior self-reported worry about mathematics and reading
   performance were included as control variables in all analyses.},

Abstract = {Post independent reforms in South Africa moved from separate education
   for the gifted learners to inclusive education in regular classrooms. A
   specific concern that has been totally ignored since then is whether or
   not the regular classroom would expand or limit the gifted child's
   creativity. This study aimed at investigating the extent to which South
   African mathematics teachers recognised and supported the development of
   gifted students' creative potential. Four teachers were each observed
   teaching over a week and the analysis focused on their representational
   fluency and how they responded to gifted students' creative ideas. The
   results show that in 70\% of the episodes teachers' representations were
   either mathematically faulty or correct but with no further
   justification or explanation. In 63\% of the micromoments students'
   creative ideas were considered disruptive and were therefore not
   recognized. These results suggest that currently regular classrooms in
   South Africa might not be conducive to the development of the gifted
   students' creative potential.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the role of mathematical pathologies as a means of
   fostering creativity in the classroom is discussed. In particular, it
   delves into what constitutes a mathematical pathology, examines
   historical mathematical pathologies as well as pathologies in
   contemporary classrooms, and indicates how the Lakatosian heuristic can
   be used to formulate problems that illustrate mathematical pathologies.
   We discuss the relationship between mathematical pathologies and their
   role in fostering creativity. The paper concludes with remarks on
   mathematical pathologies from the perspective of creativity studies at
   large.},

Title = {Proof and proving in school and university mathematics education
   research: a systematic review},

Abstract = {This systematic review aims to provide a complementary to existing
   synopses of the state-of-the-art of mathematics education research on
   proof and proving in both school and university mathematics. As an
   organizing framework, we used Cohen et al.'s triadic conceptualization
   of instruction, which draws attention not only to the main actors of the
   didactical process (i.e., the Teacher and Students) and the Content
   around which the actors' work is organized (herein, content related to
   proof and proving), but also to the relationships among the actors and
   the content. Out of the 103 papers we reviewed, almost half fell in the
   Student-Content category, which is consistent with the existence of a
   substantial number of frameworks, methods, and research findings related
   to students' engagement with proof and proving. About a quarter of the
   papers fell in the Student-Teacher-Content category, which reflects an
   emphasis on viewing instructional practice in proof and proving in a
   holistic, systemic way. Only few papers fell in the categories that did
   not include Content in them, namely, the categories of Student, Teacher,
   and Student-Teacher; this suggests mathematics education research on
   proof and proving has a strong disciplinary identity, which potentially
   differentiates it from other mathematics education research strands.
   About a fifth of the papers were oriented towards `breaking ground'
   through making an explicit theoretical and/or methodological
   contribution (Student-Teacher-Content and Content were the main
   categories where such contributions appeared), whilst the majority of
   the papers were focused on `building ground' through elaborating or
   employing existing methodological and/or theoretical approaches.},

   dedicated to exploring this topic and related issues in the preparation
   of secondary mathematics teachers-by which we mean teachers of students
   with ages, approximately, of 12-18 years. This article introduces this
   theme and provides a semi-systematic survey of recent related
   literature, which we use to elaborate and situate important theoretical
   distinctions around the problems, challenges, and solutions of
   university mathematics in relation to teacher education. As part of the
   special issue, we have gathered articles from different countries that
   elaborate theoretical and empirical approaches, which, collectively,
   describe different ways to strengthen university mathematics with
   respect to the aims of secondary teacher education. This survey paper
   serves to lay out the theoretical groundwork for the collection of
   articles in the issue.},

Abstract = {Teacher noticing can be an important element in improving teaching and
   students' mathematical success. While the focus of the international
   project Learning from Lessons was on teacher learning, in this paper we
   report what mathematics teachers noticed and claimed to learn through
   the process of planning, teaching, and reflecting on their lessons. The
   study involved teachers and research teams from three countries
   (Australia, China and Germany) with different cultures, contexts and
   pedagogies. The explicit goal of the current study was to identify
   commonalities and differences with respect to those aspects that
   teachers noticed during their teaching. A multiple case study with three
   teachers, one from each of the three participating countries, was
   conducted using prompting questions to facilitate teacher reflection.
   The process of defining and refining categories for teacher noticing was
   implemented in the methodology. The findings suggest that there were
   many commonalities across the cases despite the different cultural and
   individual backgrounds of the teachers. The specific topic and
   individual lessons as well as the teachers' expectations based on their
   lesson planning seemed to influence what the teachers noticed in their
   teaching process. The study highlights the importance of attending to
   the situational aspects of teacher noticing and learning.},

Funding-Text = {Learning from Lessons was one of David Clarke's final research projects.
   The project began as an Australian pilot project funded by the Spencer
   Foundation (USA). The project team had noticed that mathematics
   teachers' in-class learning was not given anything like the research
   focus associated with learning which emerged from professional
   development projects held off-site. As so often was the case with David
   Clarke, this notion was sufficient for him to start to conceptualise a
   project, which would explore how teachers used what they learned from
   planning and teaching a given lesson in framing the subsequent lesson.
   Findings from the pilot project encouraged the team to seek funding for
   a more substantial investigation (funded by the Australian Research
   Council Grant No. DP170102540), involving more countries and more
   diverse mathematical content. This larger study involved detailed case
   studies as well as an online survey component involving many more
   teachers. Until his passing, David Clarke continued to be the heart and
   soul of the project, valuing and building upon the ideas of all members
   of the research team.},

Abstract = {In the age of artificial intelligence where standard problems are
   increasingly processed by computers, creative problem solving, the
   ability to think outside the box is in high demand. Collaboration is
   also increasingly significant, which makes creative collaboration an
   important twenty-first-century skill. In the research described in this
   paper, we investigated students' collaborative creative process in
   mathematics and explored the collaborative creative process in its
   phases. Since little is known about the collaborative creative process,
   we conducted an explorative case study, where two students jointly
   worked on a multiple solution task. For in-depth insight into the dyad's
   collaborative creative process, we used a novel research design in
   mathematics education, DUET SRI: both students wore eye-tracking glasses
   during their collaborative work for dual eye-tracking (DUET) and they
   each participated in a subsequent stimulated recall interview (SRI)
   where eye-tracking videos from their joint work served as stimulus.
   Using an inductive data analysis method, we then identified the phases
   of the students' collaborative creative process. We found that the
   collaborative creative process and its phases had similarities to those
   previously found for solo creative work, yet the process was more
   complex and volatile and involved different branches. Based on our
   findings, we present a tentative model of the dyad's collaborative
   process in its phases, which can help researchers and educators trace
   and foster the collaborative creative process more effectively.},

Abstract = {The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and Russia, the largest of the
   countries formed in its place, has gone through notable changes in the
   period since then. This paper is devoted to the study of how (and
   whether) the mathematics curriculum has changed. At one time, before the
   revolution of 1917, Russian mathematics education was closely connected
   with Western European mathematics education (above all, German and
   French). Subsequently, their paths diverged, and later, Russian
   mathematics education became very highly regarded around the world.
   What, then, has happened over the last three decades? To what extent
   does the Russian curriculum today differ from the old Soviet curriculum
   and from contemporary curricula in other countries? The answers to these
   questions are of interest to an international audience already because
   they help in understanding the processes and distinctive characteristics
   of the development of mathematics education, including differences that
   might be concealed even behind identical terms. Based on a detailed
   analysis of Russian standards and textbooks, conclusions are drawn about
   the processes in the transformation of the curriculum that have occurred
   over thirty years, including the conclusion that the period of
   transition that began in the late 1980s is still not over. The Russian
   curriculum, of course, is not exactly the same as the curriculum of
   Soviet times, but the differences between them are by no means
   revolutionary. The paths of the development of mathematics education in
   Russia and in Western Europe and the United States, having at some point
   diverged, have still not come back together.},

Abstract = {The teaching of mathematics is mostly done with tasks that learners and
   teachers do or solve, in and outside of class. These tasks, which are
   used to illustrate concepts in mathematics, are referred to in this
   paper as examples in mathematics. Examples that teachers choose and use
   are fundamental to what mathematics is taught and learned, and what
   opportunities for learning are created in mathematics classrooms. In
   this paper, I bring together two frameworks which have been used
   separately in mathematics education research, namely variation theory,
   and meaning making as a dialogic process framework, in order to
   understand exemplifying practices in teacher education multilingual
   classrooms. Lesson transcript data from an introductory class on
   probability in one teacher education multilingual classroom are used to
   illustrate how these two theories can be used to examine the choice and
   use of examples in mathematics teacher education multilingual
   classrooms. This analysis shows the dialectic relationships among the
   mathematical object of learning, teacher moves, and the interactional
   process in which the mathematics content was imbedded.},

Abstract = {For too long, problem solving has been studied as a solitary and
   isolated activity where individuals make progress based on personal
   resources acquired from knowledge, previous experiences or moments of
   illumination; however, in society, and indeed amongst mathematicians,
   problem solving can be highly collaborative and occurs in spaces where
   external resources (technology, the internet, social connections etc.)
   are abundant. In this paper, we present research into what problem
   solving looks like in classrooms when it is done collaboratively with
   access to resources that go beyond the knowledge and past experiences of
   the individual and even the group. Results indicate that in such
   choice-affluent environments, students will seek out new resources
   either when their collective or individual resources run low and will do
   so either by looking or discussing with others. This manuscript also
   offers a new methodological tool in the form of, what we call,
   gaze-dialogue transcripts for documenting such resource acquisition.},

Abstract = {In this article, we report on the development of a novel, video-based
   measure of teachers' moment-to-moment noticing as knowledge-filtered
   perception. We developed items to capture teachers' perception of
   similarity of their own teaching to the teaching shown in three short
   video clips of authentic classroom instruction. We describe the item
   design and relate teachers' moment-to-moment noticing to their
   reflective noticing as measured by judgements of similarity teachers
   provided after viewing each video. Consistent with theory, correlations
   were of moderate size and provided evidence that the measures captured
   somewhat different information. We suggest that the difference can be
   explained by different cognitive processes: the moment-to-moment measure
   primarily captured noticing as a function of bottom-up (nonconscious)
   processes, while reflective noticing engaged top-down (conscious)
   processes. We conclude by considering strengths and limitations of this
   novel approach and the usefulness of differentiating between bottom-up
   and top-down processes to characterize existing measures of teacher
   noticing.},

Abstract = {Dynamic representational technologies (DRTs), influenced by the seminal
   work of James Kaput and colleagues, have been in use in mathematics
   classrooms for decades. In this paper, we analyze 24 classrooms in the
   United States where teachers support students' conceptual learning with
   technologies that support explorations of dynamic connections both
   within and across mathematical representations. These DRTs, built in
   alignment with Kaput's principles, form part of a curricular activity
   system that embeds a central pedagogical routine. Yet despite the use of
   common DRTs, lessons, and professional development, classroom teaching
   practices varied widely. We characterize and analyze levels of
   technology use, which vary from using the technology as a static
   resource to taking advantage of dynamism to support students' emerging
   explanations of mathematical concepts. There are important implications
   for further research into classroom use of DRTs and, more broadly, for
   curriculum developers and teacher educators.},

Abstract = {The cardinal and ordinal aspects of number have been widely written
   about as key constructs that need to be brought together in children's
   understanding in order for them to appreciate the idea of numerosity. In
   this paper, we discuss similarities and differences in the ways in which
   understandings not only of ordinality, cardinality but also additive and
   multiplicative relations have been theorized. We examine how the
   connections between these can be considered through a focus on number
   line representations and children positioning and comparing numbers. The
   responses of a cohort of South African Grade 1 learners' (6- and
   7-year-olds) to a numerical magnitude estimation task and to a numerical
   comparison task are analysed and the findings compared to those in the
   international literature, some of which argue that children's early,
   informal, understandings of cardinality and ordinality are underpinned
   by an intuitive logarithmic model relating number order and size. A main
   finding presented here is that the responses from learners in this study
   exhibited a better fit with an exponential model of the relationship
   between cardinality and ordinality. These findings raise questions about
   whether some of the findings in previous research are as universal as
   sometimes claimed.},

Title = {Developing mathematics teachers' 21st century competence for teaching in
   STEM contexts},

Abstract = {Teachers are increasingly being called upon to teach in ways that
   develop 21st century learning skills in their students. Various
   frameworks for 21st century learning have been proposed and while they
   differ, all agree on four components for development-creativity,
   collaboration, communication and critical thinking. Both individually
   and together, STEM subject areas contribute to the development and
   enactment of these skills through inquiry-based approaches to learning.
   Although integrated approaches to teaching the STEM disciplines afford
   enhanced opportunities to develop these skills, they rely on teachers
   having expertise in at least one and ideally more than one of the
   relevant underpinning disciplines. At a time when many countries are
   experiencing shortages of adequately qualified teachers of mathematics
   and some science disciplines, this presents an especially difficult
   challenge. Similarly, if teachers are to facilitate their students' 21st
   century competence they need to have this competence themselves-a fact
   that appears to have been largely ignored to date. In this paper we
   present a framework that enables novice teachers (novice to teaching in
   general, teaching a STEM discipline, or teaching integrated STEM) to
   think in detail about what they need to know, find out, or think about
   as they plan for teaching, enact teaching, and reflect on teaching. As
   well as explicating the complexity of the knowledge of teachers of
   individual and integrated STEM disciplines, the framework highlights the
   importance of teachers' own 21st century skills. Finally, we suggest
   ways in which teachers might use or adapt the framework to assist their
   students to develop their own 21st century competence.},

Abstract = {The variation theory of learning emphasizes variation as a necessary
   condition for learners to be able to discern new aspects of an object of
   learning. In a substantial number of studies, the theory has been used
   to analyze teaching and students' learning in classrooms. In mathematics
   education, variation theory has also been used to explore variation in
   sets of instructional examples. For example, it has been reported how
   teachers, by using variation and invariance within and between examples,
   can help learners to engage with mathematical structure. In this paper,
   we describe the variation theory of learning, its underlying principles,
   and how it might be appropriated by teachers. We illustrate this by an
   analysis of one teacher's teaching before and after he participated in
   three lesson studies based on variation theory. Both the theory and the
   empirical illustration focus on `what is made possible to learn' in
   different learning situations. We show that in the two analyzed lessons,
   different things were made possible to learn.},

Title = {Checkbox grading of handwritten mathematics exams with multiple
   assessors: how do students react to the resulting atomic feedback? A
   mixed-method study},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 9},
Abstract = {Handwritten tasks are better suited than digital ones to assess
   higher-order mathematics skills, as students can express themselves more
   freely. However, maintaining reliability and providing feedback can be
   challenging when assessing high-stakes, handwritten mathematics exams
   involving multiple assessors. This paper discusses a new semi-automated
   grading approach called `checkbox grading'. Checkbox grading gives each
   assessor a list of checkboxes consisting of feedback items for each
   task. The assessor then ticks those feedback items which apply to the
   student's solution. Dependencies between the checkboxes can be set to
   ensure all assessors take the same route on the grading scheme. The
   system then automatically calculates the grade and provides atomic
   feedback to the student, giving a detailed insight into what went wrong
   and how the grade was obtained. Atomic feedback consists of a set of
   format requirements for mathematical feedback items, which has been
   shown to increase feedback's reusability. Checkbox grading was tested
   during the final high school mathematics exam (grade 12) organised by
   the Flemish Exam Commission, with 60 students and 10 assessors. This
   paper focuses on students' perceptions of the received checkbox grading
   feedback and how easily they interpreted it. After the exam was graded,
   all students were sent an online questionnaire, including their
   personalised exam feedback. The questionnaire was filled in by 36
   students, and 4 of them participated in semi-structured interviews.
   Findings suggest that students could interpret the feedback from
   checkbox grading well, with no correlation between students' exam scores
   and feedback understanding. Therefore, we suggest that checkbox grading
   is an effective way to provide feedback, also for students with shaky
   subject matter knowledge.},

Title = {Exploring cultural dynamism of ethnomodelling as a pedagogical action
   for students from minority cultural groups},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 27},
Abstract = {Mathematics education is inherent to the discourse of globalization,
   which often states that mathematical knowledge is universal. Certain
   global mathematical techniques and procedures found in many mathematics
   curricula around the world often discourage students to engage in
   creating their own mathematical knowledge. This suggests that dominant
   cultural values are defined as universal or at the very least labeled as
   normative, while peripheral mathematical knowledge is tagged as merely
   simplistic, primitivistic, folkloristic, and/or as forms of obsolete
   systems. Our main purpose here is to discuss how ethnomodelling promotes
   a holistic understanding of local and global approaches in mathematics
   education, which contributes to the development of a glocal
   comprehension of mathematical practices developed by members of distinct
   cultures, which means placing them at the center of the educational
   process. Through the development of ethnomodelling, this pedagogical
   action promotes connections between day-to-day knowledge and
   systematized school curricula. Thus, this theoretical article
   demonstrates how we might consider situating local mathematical
   practices (margins) at the center (glocal) of the mathematics education
   process by decentering globalized mathematical knowledge in the search
   for peace and social justice.},

Abstract = {In this study we examined the impact of four teaching sessions on the
   history of ancient Mesopotamian mathematics, in a 10th -grade classroom.
   The sessions were taught primarily with historical objectives by
   researchers in the history of ancient mathematics. We reconstructed
   historians' practices and ethos. The presence of the researchers
   provided the opportunity to study a sequence in which history was taught
   `as a goal'. Moreover, there was no intermediary between the historians
   and the teaching given to the students, which allowed us to study
   directly the transposition choices that interested the researchers. We
   cross-referenced the qualitative and quantitative results of some of the
   previous findings with the researchers' task design and discourse. We
   focused on two aspects, namely, students' relationship to mathematics as
   a scientific activity, and the effects of the students' encounters with
   the tools and ethics of the history researcher. We found evidence
   suggesting that students may have made progress in their perception of
   mathematics `as an activity' and that a certain `depaysement' emerged.
   Further, the emergence of debates on the nature of historical sources
   suggests that the teaching of history `as an endeavor' also seemed to
   have affected the students. We conclude by proposing some methodological
   guidelines for future studies.},

Abstract = {Despite the challenges that primary historical sources present for
   students and instructors alike, engaging students with such sources as
   part of their mathematical learning experiences is an increasingly
   common instructional practice. Yet research on teaching and learning
   with primary sources remains a niche activity. It is thus reasonable to
   ask whether the use of primary sources merits broader attention from the
   mathematics education community. This article explores this question
   through the lens of Sfard's commognitive theory of learning, which views
   mathematics as a discourse and mathematical learning as the process of
   becoming a participant in that discourse. Importantly, commognitive
   tenets apply to interpretations of mathematical development at both the
   historical and individual levels. I use these tenets to analyze a
   particular type of student project that adopts a guided reading approach
   to primary sources. Specifically, I examine examples of such projects
   that have been developed and used in the US to teach core mathematical
   topics at the university level since 2003, using commognitive theory to
   characterize the potential learning opportunities they afford. As with
   all instructional materials, these opportunities can be missed in
   classroom implementation. Nevertheless, the discourses represented in
   different instructional materials render some learning opportunities
   easier to offer students, while constraining the possibility of others.
   I thus also briefly examine some of the differences between these
   primary source projects and the standard textbooks that they are
   intended to replace.},

Abstract = {The Learner's Perspective Study (LPS) offers an extremely rich source of
   data for analyses of classroom situations. In this paper we focus on
   events in mathematics classrooms through the lens of the Theory of
   Didactical Situations in Mathematics, namely, on the situation of
   institutionalization. During the phase of institutionalization, the
   teacher tends to help pupils to transform a piece of their knowledge
   from the means of resolving a problem to a reference for further uses in
   new situations. A detailed analysis of transcripts of communication
   between a Czech teacher and her 14- to 15-year-old pupils resulted in
   the classification of institutionalization into four types, as follows:
   asking additional questions referring to statements from the stage of
   validation with the aim of adding new knowledge to the repertoire;
   presenting a mathematical proof of a statement from validation; asking
   pupils to solve a similar problem; and setting problems for pupils,
   whose solution will allow them to apply the acquired knowledge. These
   are presented and illustrated in the paper. The combination of
   video-recordings from three cameras (one recording the teacher, one a
   pair of pupils and one the whole class), together with interviews with
   the teacher and the pair of pupils, materials prepared by the teacher,
   and pupils' productions, allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the
   role of institutionalization in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Documents specifying a national mathematics curriculum for grades K-12
   have recently been written in Israel. We focus on the calculus component
   for the highest of three matriculation bound levels, and specifically on
   the influence of research on this component. In addition to issues of
   content, we identify three principles that have led the writing team,
   namely, the manner in which sample tasks in the curriculum document
   incorporate fundamental mathematical ideas and mathematical Reasoning,
   the Impact expected from connecting mathematics to its role in everyday
   life and science, and the Cultivation of fertile intellectual ground
   from which new concepts may emerge naturally. We demonstrate how these
   principles are implemented in the unit on integration. We show that
   mathematics education research, though not mentioned explicitly, has had
   a profound and pervasive influence on the content and principles of the
   curriculum document, from the design of entire units down to the
   formulation of sample tasks.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we extend the notion of noticing during the planning of a
   lesson to examine what and how teachers notice concerning the
   affordances of typical problems, such as examination-type or standard
   textbook questions. Teachers in examination-oriented educational systems
   generally use these types of problems to develop procedural skills.
   However, the affordances of such problems for developing conceptual
   understanding have been largely untapped. Here, we present an
   exemplifying case of a mathematics teacher, Alice, who used typical
   problems effectively in her classroom to deepen students' understanding
   of mathematics. We argue that Alice productively noticed the affordances
   of these typical problems beyond their usual use, and we suggest
   recommendations for supporting mathematics teachers in providing
   high-quality learning experiences for all students.},

Abstract = {Research on the sociocultural and sociopolitical dimensions of
   mathematics education has grown substantially in the last three decades
   to become part of the mathematics education mainstream. However, little
   attention has been given to sociocultural and sociopolitical dimensions
   of adult numeracy practices of migrants in their host countries. The
   purpose of this paper is to identify the sociocultural and
   sociopolitical dimensions of adult numeracy; to make visible the
   sociocultural and sociopolitical aspects that impact adult numeracy of
   migrants as vulnerable groups; to frame the sociocultural and
   sociopolitical dimensions of migrant groups' adult numeracy; and to
   review and critique research on migrants' adult numeracy from
   socio-cultural-political perspectives. The paper engages theoretical
   analytic argumentation and critical examination of evidence from
   relevant research studies. Implications are drawn for research on the
   sociopolitical dimensions of adult numeracy in general, and migrants'
   numeracy in particular, and for incorporating adult numerate practices
   in school mathematics curriculum and instruction.},

Title = {Numeracy, adult education, and vulnerable adults: a critical view of a

Abstract = {This survey paper examines selected issues related to the intersection
   of three broad scholarly areas: numeracy, adult education, and
   vulnerability. Numeracy encompasses the ways in which people cope with
   the mathematical, quantitative, and statistical demands of adult life,
   and is viewed as an important outcome of schooling and as a foundational
   skill for all adults. The focus on vulnerability stems from the
   realization that concerns of policy makers and educators alike often
   center on populations seen as vulnerable. The paper is organized in five
   sections. After a brief introduction, Section 2 examines adult numeracy,
   focusing on five numeracy domains (health, financial, digital, civic,
   and workplace numeracy), literacy-numeracy linkages, functional and
   critical aspects of numeracy, and the centrality of numeracy practices,
   and notes sources of vulnerability for each of these. Section 3 sketches
   formal, non-formal and informal contexts in which adults learn or
   develop their numeracy, and examines factors that may be potential
   sources of vulnerability, including systemic factors and dispositional
   and affect factors. Section 4 reflects more broadly on the concept of
   vulnerability, introduces selected aspects of the papers published in
   this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, and points to findings
   regarding adult learners who may be deemed vulnerable. The closing
   section summarizes conclusions and research directions regarding the
   intersection of the three core domains. Overall, the paper points to
   emerging research needs and educational challenges that are relevant to
   scholars, practitioners, and policy makers interested in developing the
   numeracy of adults as well as in the mathematics education of younger
   learners.},

Abstract = {``Out-of-field{''} teaching refers to the practice of assigning
   secondary school teachers to teach subjects that do not match their
   training or education. This practice is an issue of concern in many
   countries around the world, and seems particularly prevalent in the
   teaching of mathematics. The aim of this paper is to analyse the design
   principles underpinning the development and delivery of a blended
   learning program of professional development for out-of-field teachers
   of secondary school mathematics in Ireland. Three theoretical frameworks
   inform our analysis of the blended learning design. The first identifies
   critical dimensions of blended learning environments as a boundary
   object facilitating coordination of face-to-face and computer-mediated
   instruction. The second framework conceptualises out-of-field teaching
   as a boundary-crossing event, and identifies contextual factors, support
   mechanisms and personal resources that influence identity formation in
   out-of-field teachers as they move between different disciplinary
   fields. The third framework identifies the structural and core features
   of effective teacher professional development: the form, duration and
   coherence of activities; nature of teacher participation; focus on
   (mathematical) content knowledge; and opportunities to engage in active
   learning. The original contribution made by our analysis is to integrate
   these frameworks within a blended learning context, with the aim of
   identifying the distinctive features of the Professional Diploma in
   Mathematics for Teaching afforded by this delivery mode.},

Title = {Refugees and numeracy: what can we learn from international large-scale
   assessments, especially from TIMSS?},

Abstract = {At least 66 million people globally are experiencing forced displacement
   and had to flee their homes in order to escape war, persecution, and
   natural disasters. Countries that have accepted larger refugee
   populations must address the task of enabling their participation in
   society. Besides other aspects, numeracy skills are important for all
   individuals, including refugees, in coping with mathematical demands
   within private and public life and participating in society as informed
   and reflective citizens. Research shows that little is known about
   refugees' educational backgrounds, especially concerning numeracy and
   mathematics, despite such knowledge being of great relevance for
   policymakers in receiving societies. To alleviate this gap, our aim in
   this paper is to study the numeracy skills of refugees and to discuss
   how far these findings can be of help in nourishing a successful
   educational pathway for refugees and facilitating their participation in
   their receiving society. By exploring large-scale studies, in particular
   the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), we
   found that respondents in the selected Middle Eastern and North African
   (MENA) countries perform significantly below those in Italy and Sweden
   in the area of mathematics achievement, but those in MENA countries have
   more positive attitudes. However, the fact that refugees are a very
   heterogeneous group makes it difficult to make general statements about
   them based on international large-scale studies. Overall, our paper
   points to a considerable need for an expanded research agenda that can
   inform policymakers and decision makers regarding refugees and numeracy,
   in order to create or redesign adequate educational programs.},

Abstract = {Based on an investigation of research literature on the role of
   mathematics within the context of STEM education and twenty-first
   century skills, this explorative study presents and analyses 19
   pre-service teachers' lesson proposals for innovative STEM activities in
   secondary mathematics classrooms. Drawing on a categorisation of
   twenty-first century skills and key concepts from Realistic Mathematics
   Education and Basil Bernstein's writings, the analysis indicated a use
   of detailed instructions regarding what students should do but
   unspecified criteria for their expected knowledge productions. Rather
   than serving as a digital tool for problem solving, programming was used
   for the purpose of generalising students' conceptual knowledge in
   mathematics. At the same time a focus on modelling and applications in
   the STEM activities tended to weaken the disciplinary character of
   mathematics. The learning of various twenty-first century skills was
   promoted to different extents. The study raises a discussion of
   affordances and constraints regarding students' access to mathematical
   knowledge through different modes of integration of mathematics and
   other STEM subjects aiming to support the development of twenty-first
   century skills.},

Abstract = {Mathematical argumentation is generally thought to be the paradigm of
   cogent reasoning. The concept of mathematical proof thus seems to be
   associated with necessity and enforcement, but not with freedom;
   however, in various ways a reference to freedom is also needed to
   understand the phenomenon of mathematical proof, for example, to
   distinguish it from a merely mechanical functioning. Moreover, without
   reference to these freedom-related aspects the value of incorporating
   proofs into the teaching of mathematics lacks an essential aspect of
   justification. The paper sheds light on some of these aspects and offers
   a picture of mathematical proof in tension between freedom and
   enforcement.},

Abstract = {Some researchers advocate a statistical modeling approach to inference
   that draws on students' intuitions about factors influencing phenomena
   and that requires students to build models. Such a modeling approach to
   inference became possible with the creation of TinkerPlots Sampler
   technology. However, little is known about what statistical modeling
   reasoning students need to acquire. Drawing and building on previous
   research, this study aims to uncover the statistical modeling reasoning
   students need to develop. A design-based research methodology employing
   Model Eliciting Activities was used. The focus of this paper is on two
   11-year-old students as they engaged with a bag weight task using
   TinkerPlots. Findings indicate that these students seem to be developing
   the ability to build models, investigate and posit factors, consider
   variation and make decisions based on simulated data. From the analysis
   an initial statistical modeling framework is proposed. Implications of
   the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this paper we explore how students can experience the relevance of
   mathematical modelling activities. In the literature we found that
   relevance is a connection among several issues (relevance of what? to
   whom? according to whom? and to what end?). We framed this concept in
   terms of Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), a theory for
   analysing how individuals engage in activities within social
   environments. We designed modelling activities within a mathematics
   course for engineering students: there were ample mathematical modelling
   tasks, a guest lecture by an employee from an engine company who used
   mathematical modelling in his job, and a group work modelling assessment
   with a presentation to the whole group. After the course, we interviewed
   ten students with a wide range of final grades in the course. We
   analysed the interview data in light of the theoretical framing of the
   concept of relevance. Our analysis showed that, generally, students
   experienced the modelling activities as relevant, and that they imagined
   themselves working in professional practices for which mathematics is
   relevant. However, doing mathematics was also judged as being relevant
   only to obtain grades, leave school and enter professions for which
   mathematics might not be needed. We offer recommendations for making
   mathematics education more relevant to more students.},

Abstract = {Well-designed curriculum materials include educative components that
   help teachers effectively plan, implement, and adapt activities for
   diverse learners. Digital materials offer several affordances over print
   materials in the format, fit, and flexibility of the educative
   information provided to teachers, as well as the ability of the
   materials to track and follow-up on teacher behaviors. Drawing on
   current research and development projects, this paper describes two
   promising approaches that take advantage of these digital affordances to
   enhance the educative experience for teachers. The first approach,
   called the expansion approach, allows nearly limitless expansion of the
   amount, type, and nature of educative resources offered to teachers as
   they use a curriculum. The second approach, called the feedback
   approach, provides customized educative feedback based on teacher needs
   and behaviors while using a curriculum. These approaches have
   implications for future curriculum design and research.},

Abstract = {The paper describes how designers used the construct of learning
   trajectories to create a tool, Math-Mapper 6-8, to help scaffold
   curricula toward increased learner-centered coherence. It defines
   ``learner-centered curricular coherence{''} as ``an organizational means
   to promote a high likelihood that each learner traverses one of many
   possible paths to understand target disciplinary ideas in a
   curriculum.{''} The tool's features, including its learning map,
   diagnostic assessments, and reporting system, are tied to its underlying
   foundation in learning trajectories. Three preliminary studies of the
   implemented tool's effects are reported to provide insight to its
   influence on curricular sequencing, students' patterns of performance in
   early algebra, and student responses to the assessments.},

Abstract = {This survey paper discusses recent relevant contributions and trends in
   university-based teacher education `programs' for in-service and
   pre-service teachers. The goal of this small-scale survey of the
   mathematics education literature was to identify examples of studies
   that investigated such programs and their effectiveness in supporting
   change in teachers' knowledge, disposition, and teaching for the
   improvement of students' learning of mathematics. Themes emerging from
   the sample of these studies are identified and described to illustrate
   the nature and effectiveness of the programs, and implications for
   teacher education. Connections are made to the themes used to frame this
   special issue of ZDM Mathematics Education and how the studies in it
   contribute to this aspect of the field of mathematics education and
   further our understanding of it.},

Abstract = {Dehumanized and globalized mathematics education in the last centuries
   has led to established learning processes disconnected from indigenous
   knowledge. The effect of cognitive imperialism, given the systematic
   negation of the language and the culture, has as a disastrous
   consequence of the gradual and systematic loss of knowledge and
   indigenous reasoning. Thus, recognizing, appreciating and updating it
   turns into a task and challenge for the teaching and learning of math in
   the intercultural classroom. Therefore, the purpose of this research is
   to focus on analyzing the mathematical reasoning of the indigenous
   student while encoding and decoding an historic numeric registry
   artifact called puron (knot in the Mapuche language). The study was
   conducted in three schools on Mapuche territory of Araucania Region in
   Chile, using the Participatory Action Research method. The results show
   that encoding/decoding quantities helps indigenous students to recognize
   structures and to establish a numeration system close to the
   historically reported cultural practices of the Mapuche people.
   Moreover, it extends the mathematical quantitative structure and
   reasoning to an arithmetic one seen in the present day cultural
   practices such as the measurement of fields for planting. Thus, the
   experience contributes to the students' linguistic awareness of
   Mapudungun (Mapuche language) in a numeration system framework.},

Abstract = {Curriculum resources such as textbooks and lesson guides communicate
   messages about the social relations between the teacher, students,
   artefacts, and the mathematics. Because of their implicit nature, these
   messages can be hard to surface and perhaps therefore are not frequently
   covered in curriculum resource analysis. Tackling this shortcoming, we
   examine mathematics lesson guides or the daily lesson descriptions
   written for elementary teachers. Drawing on multimodality and activity
   theory, we characterize the social relations messaged in the lesson
   guides in terms of two constructs: authority and distance. We present
   and illustrate an analytical approach to uncovering these messages in
   lesson guides from Sweden, USA, and Flanders. Our analytical approach
   enabled us to distinguish configurations of social relations that vary
   primarily across the three educational contexts, which strengthens our
   argument for viewing the configuration of social relations as a cultural
   script.},

Abstract = {During the last decades, the study of how learners and teachers of
   mathematics use the resource of language has contributed to our
   understanding of mathematics teaching and learning in a variety of
   classrooms and cultures. Developmental work with mathematics teachers on
   the particular resource of mathematics teaching talk is more recent. In
   order to explore responses related to the importance of this talk, in
   this paper we consider three sites of practice in mathematics
   education-research, professional development and teaching-and
   illustrations of data from or about them, including studies from the
   literature, and work with secondary school mathematics teachers in
   Catalonia-Spain and Malawi around the teaching of angles. We argue that
   tensions permeate these sites of practice when a focus is placed on word
   use, specifically the practices of naming and explaining, in mathematics
   teaching talk. We conclude that the importance of mathematics teaching
   talk is construed through tensions with other resources in language and
   teaching. Tensions specifically appear in the realisation of mathematics
   teaching talk as mediational in the work with mathematics teachers on
   their classroom teaching.},

Abstract = {Mathematics interest is highly relevant for students' academical and
   emotional development in the domain of mathematics. Thus, it appears
   alarming that students' mathematics interest decreases during the course
   of secondary school. Teacher self-efficacy is a central facet of teacher
   motivation and is assumed to be highly relevant for student mathematics
   interest. However, there is a paucity of research that investigates the
   longitudinal and indirect relations through which teacher self-efficacy
   relates to students' interest through their teaching behaviors in
   mathematics classrooms. Therefore, in the present longitudinal study we
   aim to contribute to research by identifying how teacher self-efficacy
   for student engagement contributes to students' mathematics interest in
   secondary classrooms through student- and teacher-reported support. We
   used a sample of mathematics teachers (n = 50) and their students (n =
   959). Longitudinal data of three measurement waves collected from German
   ninth grade mathematics classrooms were included in the analysis.
   Results of latent-manifest multi-level analysis showed that teacher
   self-efficacy for student engagement at Time 1 (beginning of ninth
   grade) positively predicted student-perceived, but not
   teacher-perceived, teacher emotional support at Time 2 (beginning of
   tenth grade), which in turn positively predicted students' mathematics
   interest at Time 3 (middle of tenth grade). A possible implication for
   mathematics teachers' educational practice involves strengthening
   mathematics teachers' self-efficacy for student engagement by means of
   direct interventions and in-servive training for mathematics teachers.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent national lockdown in South Africa
   induced a rapid, albeit challenging, implementation of blended learning
   (with a strong online focus) at all educational levels. During this
   time, a group of teachers were involved in a specialised computer
   integrated education course, preparing them for the design and
   implementation of technologically enhanced modes of teaching. In this
   research we considered the positive impact of the situation during the
   pandemic on these mathematics teachers' practice, as well as their
   conceptualisation of the way forward for technology enhanced mathematics
   education. We conducted an explorative survey study, employing an
   enactivist approach, to investigate their experiences of addressing
   procedural and conceptual aspects of mathematics education, as well as
   their observations of learners' reactions to these changed practices.
   Our findings show that participants experienced their exposure to
   technology as creating an environment they foresee will have a lasting
   impact on their teaching practice. Participants emphasised the
   importance of using educational technology meaningfully as a cognitive
   tool that allows for learners to learn with the technology and not from
   the technology, which impacts on the importance of learner-centred
   teaching strategies and the development of high cognitive level
   interactive learning activities.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we elaborate the seeds of algebraic thinking perspective,
   drawing upon Knowledge in Pieces as a heuristic epistemological
   framework. We argue that students' pre-instructional experiences in
   early childhood lay the foundation for algebraic thinking and are a
   largely untapped resource in developing students' algebraic thinking in
   the classroom. We theorize that seeds of algebraic thinking are
   cognitive resources abstracted over many interactions with the world in
   children's pre-instructional experience. Further, we provide examples to
   demonstrate how the same seeds of algebraic thinking present in early
   childhood can be invoked in reasoning across contexts, grade levels, and
   different levels of formality of algebraic instruction. The examples
   demonstrate how the seeds perspective differs from other accounts of the
   relationship between children's early activity and their engagement in
   algebraic reasoning processes. We anticipate this new theoretical
   direction for characterizing the nature and development of algebraic
   thinking will lay the foundation for a robust agenda that sheds light on
   the development of algebraic thinking and informs algebra instruction,
   particularly how teachers notice and respond to children's developing
   algebraic thinking.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the Singapore school calculus curriculum at the upper
   secondary and the pre-university levels is examined in the light of the
   Singapore mathematics curriculum framework. Three key features of the
   calculus content are discerned: (1) an intuitive approach to calculus
   supported by the use of technology; (2) an emphasis on techniques; and
   (3) an emphasis on procedural over conceptual knowledge. Following that
   analysis, a review of the performance of a group of pre-university
   students on selected calculus tasks in a calculus survey prior to and
   after their learning of pre-university calculus is discussed. The
   students' performance in the survey shows that many students did not
   visually identify calculus concepts that were studied procedurally. They
   demonstrated a lack of conceptual understanding of the calculus
   procedures. This study suggests that the partial calculus knowledge
   acquired in the early upper secondary levels might not necessarily
   facilitate the acquisition of a more complete concept at the
   pre-university level. Furthermore, the students' procedural knowledge of
   calculus did not seem to develop their procedural fluency or
   flexibility.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of our analysis of a sample of 254
   Calculus I final exams (collectively containing 4,167 individual items)
   administered at U.S. colleges and universities. We characterize the
   specific meanings of foundational concepts the exams assessed, identify
   features of exam items that assess productive meanings, distinguish
   categories of items for which students' responses are not likely to
   reflect their understanding, and suggest associated modifications to
   these items that would assess students' possession of more productive
   understandings. The article concludes with a discussion of what our
   findings indicate about the standards and expectations for students'
   learning of calculus at institutions of higher education in the United
   States. We also discuss implications for calculus assessment design and
   suggest areas for further research.},

Title = {Do cultural norms influence how teacher noticing is studied in different
   cultural contexts? A focus on expert norms of responding to students'
   mathematical thinking},

Abstract = {As an important component of teaching expertise, teacher noticing is
   gaining growing attention in our intercultural mathematics education
   community. However, it is likely that in many cases the researchers'
   perspectives on what characterizes high instructional quality in
   mathematics classrooms shape what they expect teachers to notice. In
   particular, it is an open question how potentially different norms of
   instructional quality influence how teacher noticing is operationalized
   in East Asian and Western cultures. Consequently, in a first step, this
   bicultural research project on teacher noticing in Taiwan and Germany
   focuses on exploring the researchers' frames of reference for
   investigating teacher noticing. In this paper, we thus propose a
   concurrent process for developing vignettes and eliciting corresponding
   expert norms as a prerequisite to investigating teacher noticing in a
   way that is sensitive to different cultural contexts. In this process,
   the research teams in both countries developed in parallel, text
   vignettes in which, from their perspective, a breach of a norm regarding
   a specific aspect of instructional quality was integrated. In an online
   expert survey, these vignettes were then presented to German and
   Taiwanese researchers in mathematics education (19 from each country) to
   investigate whether these experts recognize the integrated breach of a
   norm. This approach allows researchers to identify potentially different
   norms of instructional quality in mathematics classrooms. In particular,
   by means of a specific representation of practice, it became visible how
   expert norms of responding to students' mathematical thinking can be
   different from a Taiwanese compared to a German perspective.},

Abstract = {Innovative methods can change the paradigm of teaching mathematics and
   inspire teachers to espouse new ideas and gain new experiences. The
   flipped classroom (FC) is currently an innovative pedagogical approach
   that has high potential to transform the teaching of mathematics. In the
   case study described in this paper, we investigated one mathematics
   teacher's transformation of teaching in two mathematics classrooms
   through implementing interventions based on FC methods; furthermore, we
   identified several key points of FC design as well as challenges and
   opportunities afforded by teaching mathematics in FCs. The results of
   the study showed that the tasks posed by the teacher, the implemented
   discourse, teacher feedback and scaffolding, and the teaching-learning
   environment were changed in FCs, although the approaches used by the
   teacher to analyze the tasks and students' learning were similar to
   those used in non-FCs, which points out the strengths of traditional
   teaching approaches. The study indicates that although teaching
   mathematics in FCs created some difficulties for teaching, well-designed
   FCs offered a great opportunity to promote students' mathematical
   thinking and understanding. Overall, the results highlight that through
   FC, teachers can develop students' mathematical potential with FCs.},

Abstract = {In this paper we report on findings from a study of 5-to-6-year-old
   children's ways of structuring part-part-whole relations using finger
   patterns. We focused our analysis on data from interviews with 28
   children who during their last year of preschool learned to enact a
   structural approach. We used this data set to analyze their different
   ways of structuring a task with one part unknown, and what constitutes
   the ability to structure the task in a conceptually powerful way. The
   way children structure number relations was interpreted as being related
   to how they experience the task at hand. We identified some ways of
   structuring as being more powerful for future learning, particularly
   those that facilitate the child in experiencing parts and the whole
   simultaneously. We suggest that there are three aspects that children
   need to discern in order to structure the task successfully in both the
   short and the long term: what constitutes the whole, the parts within
   the whole, and finger patterns as a representation of the cardinality of
   a set. The pedagogical implications are that attention to children's
   ways of experiencing the number relations in arithmetic tasks gives
   clues to why some children develop powerful strategies, and how to
   support children in their learning to solve arithmetic tasks.},

Abstract = {There are many choices for learning mathematics for engineering students
   with courses available in face-to-face, blended and fully online
   modalities. Students are demanding more flexibility in their programs,
   however the temptation to misuse this flexibility to avoid mathematical
   studies until it is too late can be an unfortunate side effect. A key
   issue here is that students may not have the skills needed to
   effectively self-regulate their learning. Using the 3P model of student
   learning as a guide we explore what happens to student learning outcomes
   when the best available online and face-to-face teaching and learning
   for mathematics students are used to create a blended learning
   environment for first year engineers that encourages self-regulation of
   learning. Experiments included online quizzes for changing attitudes,
   refreshing assumed knowledge and teaching foundational concepts,
   archived online lecture options in addition to face-to-face lectures,
   the adoption of board tutorials supported by a problem-solving approach
   for more complex engineering modelling problems and scaffolded with
   online interactive problems. Shared websites for online and face-to-face
   cohorts allowed the amount of blending to be determined by the
   individual student. Learning outcomes for blended first year engineering
   mathematics courses can be improved by implementing online learning
   tools that automate key learning conversations and implement effective
   face-to-face learning activities such as board tutorials that support
   students to self-regulate their learning of mathematics.},

Abstract = {It is commonplace in the educational literature on mathematical practice
   to argue for a general conclusion from isolated quotations from famous
   mathematicians. In this paper, we supply a critique of this mode of
   inference. We review empirical results that show the diversity and
   instability of mathematicians' opinions on mathematical practice. Next,
   we compare mathematicians' diverse and conflicting testimony on the
   nature and purpose of proof. We lay especial emphasis on the diverse
   responses mathematicians give to the challenges that digital
   technologies present to older conceptions of mathematical practice. We
   examine the career of one much cited and anthologised paper, WP
   Thurston's `On Proof and Progress in Mathematics' (1994). This paper has
   been multiply anthologised and cited hundreds of times in educational
   and philosophical argument. We contrast this paper with the views of
   other, equally distinguished mathematicians whose use of digital
   technology in mathematics paints a very different picture of
   mathematical practice. The interesting question is not whether
   mathematicians disagree-they are human so of course they do. The
   question is how homogenous is their mathematical practice. If there are
   deep differences in practice between mathematicians, then it makes
   little sense to use isolated quotations as indicators of how mathematics
   is uniformly or usually done. The paper ends with reflections on the
   usefulness of quotations from research mathematicians for mathematical
   education.},

Abstract = {In this paper we examine the relationship between teachers' knowledge,
   beliefs and instructional practices based on a study with 495 Chinese
   pre-service mathematics teachers. The results indicate that Chinese
   pre-service mathematics teachers tend to hold mixed beliefs about the
   nature of mathematics, and a constructivist view about mathematics
   teaching and learning, and that they are inclined to report that their
   teaching is inquiry-oriented. Mathematical content knowledge (MCK) and
   mathematics pedagogical content knowledge (MPCK) were found not to
   correlate with the teachers' self-reported instructional practice, in
   contrast to pre-service mathematics teachers' beliefs, which showed a
   stronger association with their self-reported inquiry-oriented
   instructional practice. Moreover, pre-service teachers' dynamic beliefs
   about the nature of mathematics, and constructivist beliefs about
   mathematics teaching and learning, acted as mediators between
   pre-service mathematics teachers' MCK, MPCK and instructional practice
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Play is central to children's learning and development in the early
   years, including the learning of mathematics. The aim of the present
   study was to explore how play skills are related to mathematical skills
   in toddlers by examining the correlations between different kinds of
   play skills and mathematical skills, and how level of play skills is
   related to mathematical skills. The participants were 1088 toddlers in
   Norwegian Early Childhood and Care institutions who were observed by the
   staff in 3-month periods beginning when they were 21/2 years old. The
   skills in mathematics and play were assessed by structured observation.
   The overall scores for play skills and the scores for all types of play
   skills correlated significantly with the scores for all mathematical
   areas and the total score for mathematics. The skills Interaction in
   Play and Independence in Play displayed the strongest correlations with
   mathematical skills. Rule-based Play was difficult for the toddlers,
   whereas Pretend Play and Exploring and Construction Play correlated with
   mathematical skills and may be types of play that are more suitable when
   introducing mathematics in toddler groups. When the group of toddlers
   was divided into three subgroups according to their level of play
   skills, the level of play skills was strongly related to the level of
   mathematical skills. Toddlers with weak, middle or strong play skills
   also exhibited corresponding low, medium or high levels of mathematics
   skills, which emphasises the importance of understanding the relations
   between play and mathematical learning when working with toddlers.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is on the one hand to discuss from an APOS
   (Action-Process-Object-Schema) theory perspective the mental
   constructions involved in the learning of linear algebra, through
   examples concerning the linear transformation concept and related
   notions. On the other hand, methodological issues related to the design
   of research instruments and implementation of didactic interviews are
   discussed, supported by empirical data. Detailed analysis of transcripts
   from an interview with a student focuses on strategies used in
   interviewing as well as the mental stages involved in the construction
   of some linear algebra concepts. Due to the strategies employed, during
   the interview it is possible to witness the transition between different
   conceptions. A discussion of the relationships and interactions between
   different mental structures and mechanisms that play a role in the
   development of knowledge is provided, including theoretical
   considerations on the matter. Recommendations about pedagogical
   strategies are included.},

Abstract = {Mathematical connections are widely considered an important aspect of
   learning linear algebra, particularly at the introductory level. One
   effective strategy for teaching mathematical connections in introductory
   linear algebra is through inquiry-based learning (IBL). The demands of
   IBL instruction can make it difficult to implement such strategies in
   courses in which the instructor faces various constraints. The findings
   presented here are the product of an action research study in which IBL
   instructional materials were designed for a large-enrolled introductory
   linear algebra course with limited class time. This resulted in IBL
   being presented in a limited capacity alongside traditional lecture in
   what will be described as adapted inquiry. Specifically, these IBL
   materials were designed as vehicles through which students could form
   mathematical connections. This study was conducted with the goal of
   determining what mathematical connections students appear to be able to
   exhibit within the context of an adapted inquiry approach to IBL
   instruction.},

Abstract = {We explore 11-12-year-old students' emerging ideas of models and
   modelling as they engage in a data-modelling task involving inquiry
   based on data obtained from an experiment. We report on a design-based
   study in which students identified what and how to measure, decided how
   to structure and represent data, and made inferences and predictions
   based on data. Our focus was on the following: (1) the nature of the
   student-generated models and (2) how students evaluated the models. Data
   from written work generated by groups and transcripts of interviews were
   analysed using progressive focussing. The results showed that groups
   constructed models of actual data by paying attention to various aspects
   of distributions. We found a tendency to use differing criteria for
   evaluating the success of models. This data modelling process also
   fostered students' making sense of key ideas, tools and procedures in
   statistics that are usually treated in isolation and without context in
   school mathematics. In particular, we identified how some students
   appeared to gain insights into how a good' statistical model might
   incorporate some properties that are invariant when the simulation is
   repeated for small and large sample sizes (signal) and other properties
   that are not sustained in the same way (noise).},

Abstract = {Researchers from different fields have developed different observational
   instruments to capture instructional quality with a focus on generic
   versus content-specific dimensions or a combination of both. As this
   work is fast accumulating, the need to explore synergies and
   complementarities among existing work on instruction and its quality
   becomes imperative, given the complexity of instruction and the
   increasing realization that different frameworks illuminate certain
   instructional aspects but leave others less visible. This special issue
   makes a step toward exploring such synergies and complementarities,
   drawing on the analysis of the same 3 elementary-school lessons by 11
   groups using 12 different frameworks. The purpose of the current paper
   is to provide an up-to-date overview of prior attempts made to work at
   the intersection of different observational frameworks. The paper also
   serves as the reference point for the other papers included in the
   special issue, by defining the goals and research questions driving the
   explorations presented in each paper, outlining the criteria for
   selecting the frameworks included in the special issue, describing the
   sampling approaches for the selected lessons, presenting the content of
   these lessons, and providing an overview of the structure of each paper.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the teaching for robust understanding
   (TRU) Framework, its origins, and its evolving use. The core assertion
   underlying the TRU Framework is that there are five dimensions of
   activities along which a classroom must do well, if students are to
   emerge from that classroom being knowledgeable and resourceful
   disciplinary thinkers and problem solvers. The main focus of TRU is not
   on what the teacher does, but on the opportunities the environment
   affords students for deep engagement with mathematical content. This
   paper's use of the TRU framework to highlight salient aspects of three
   classroom videos affords a compare-and-contrast with other analytic
   frameworks, highlighting the importance of both the focus on student
   experience and the mathematics-specific character of the analysis. This
   is also the first paper on the framework that introduces a family of
   TRU-related tools for purposes of professional development.},

Abstract = {Simplifying symbolic expressions is usually perceived in middle school
   algebra as an algorithmic activity, achieved by performing sequences of
   short drill-and-practice tasks, which have little to do with conceptual
   learning or with creative mathematical thinking. The aim of this study
   is to explore possible ways by which ninth-grade students can be
   encouraged to apply flexible and creative thinking in the context of a
   task that requires students to design a multiple-choice questionnaire on
   equivalent algebraic expressions. Fifty-six ninth-grade students
   answered Take-a-Quiz and Make-a-Quiz questionnaires. The findings
   indicate that students can be engaged in a satisfactory way in these
   kinds of non-routine tasks. Also, about two-thirds of the participating
   students were able to display a medium or high level of originality in
   their construction of equivalent expressions. In addition, an analysis
   of the non-equivalent expressions suggested by the participating
   students as distractors indicated a relatively high level of awareness
   to the most common errors that might occur in this type of activity.},

Abstract = {This study examines the multiplicative problem-solving strategies used
   by a 14-year-old student with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual
   disabilities during an instructional process based on the Conceptual
   Model-based Problem Solving (COMPS) approach. The instruction aimed to
   enhance conceptual comprehension of problem-solving by the use of model
   diagrams representing mathematical relations involved in word problems.
   These diagrams aid in selecting the appropriate operation for each type
   of multiplicative problem, including equal-groups, multiplicative
   comparison, and combination problems. We further discuss how the
   instructional process promoted conceptual understanding for the three
   problem types, highlighting the development of strategies (modeling,
   counting, and operations) and the pivotal role of the COMPS methodology
   components in this progression. The results indicate that the student
   adeptly adopted the COMPS approach, facilitating the transition from
   informal modeling to written operations, with his choice of strategies
   varying depending on the type of problem. While there was a higher
   utilization of modeling strategies in equal-groups and combination
   problems, modeling was not as frequently employed in comparison
   problems. We speculate how this differentiated strategy preference could
   be associated with certain characteristics of the disorder.},

Abstract = {Mathematical modelling (MM) plays a pivotal role in the integration of
   Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) into school
   studies. This current empirical study suggests using a four-step
   solution plan as a scaffolding tool during the instruction of MM tasks
   in a STEM context in formal school mathematics. The study goals are
   twofold; first to recognise MM-oriented scaffolding practices of
   teachers during observations of their instruction of MM tasks. Second,
   to explore the differences in type and quantity of the recognised
   scaffolding practices, while comparing MM task instruction in a STEM
   context of expert and novice teachers. Using a multiple case study
   design, we conducted an in-depth study of MM scaffolding practices
   implemented during instruction of three MM tasks in a STEM context (the
   `Mobileye', `Gamma correction', and `GPS' MM tasks) taught by three
   expert teachers and five novice teachers, in a total of five lessons for
   each group. Findings revealed three types of practices to support a
   particular solution plan step, enact the transition between solution
   plan steps, and motivate students' MM learning. A similar distribution
   of practices between expert and novice teachers was revealed, while
   support in each step of the solution plan was evident to all, especially
   during the mathematical search step. The study provides a perspective on
   the necessary practices that may take place in modelling instruction in
   a STEM context.},

Abstract = {Language is a source of power that preserves the status quo in its
   relationships with learners and mathematics. However, there is a dearth
   of research that examines how multiple systems of power (e.g., racism,
   cisheteropatriarchy, colonialism) shape variation in structural
   inequality and experiences of oppression for language learners. This
   conceptual paper argues that intersectionality is a promising analytical
   lens to advance interdisciplinary research on language in mathematics
   education that nuances knowledge about linguistic justice for racially
   minoritized and Indigenous learners. To develop this argument, we
   present insights from a scoping review of research in language education
   and mathematics education. Our review shows how intersectional analyses
   can interrogate inequities of language in mathematics education
   contexts, which are entrenched in ideologies of neutrality that leave
   exclusionary practices of teaching and learning unchecked. The review
   also depicts how uptake of intersectionality extends sociopolitical
   research on language in mathematics education that left interplay
   between racism, colonialism, linguicism, and other power systems
   unexamined for nuanced insights on linguistic justice. Following the
   review, we look across three cases of research studies from our review
   that vary in terms of their designs and methodologies to illustrate the
   analytical possibilities of intersectionality in future research on
   language in mathematics education. We conclude with a discussion of how
   adopting the lens of intersectionality is necessary to advance
   interdisciplinary scholarship for linguistic justice.},

Abstract = {This paper builds on our previous research and investigates how
   students' fractional competence and reasoning can provide clear evidence
   of non-symbolic algebraic thinking and its progressive transition
   towards fully generalised algebraic thinking. In a large-scale study,
   470 primary students completed a written paper and pencil test. This
   included three reverse fraction tasks which required students to find an
   unknown whole when presented with a quantity representing a fraction of
   that whole. Seventeen students from one participating primary school
   undertook a semi-structured interview which included reverse fraction
   tasks, similar to those on the written test, but with progressive levels
   of abstraction, starting with particular instances and becoming more
   generalised. Two important products of the study are the Classification
   Framework for Reverse Fraction Tasks and the Emerging Algebraic
   Reasoning Framework. The interview results highlight two critical
   transition points for the emergence of students' algebraic reasoning.
   The first is the ability to transition from additive strategies to
   multiplicative strategies to solve reverse fraction problems. Students
   reliant on diagrams and additive strategies struggled to solve more
   generalised tasks that required multiplicative rather than additive
   strategies. The second transition is the shift from multiplicative
   thinking to algebraic reasoning where students could generalise their
   multiplicative knowledge to deal with any quantity represented in a
   reverse fraction task.},

Abstract = {Lockwood has argued that taking a set-oriented perspective is critical
   for successful combinatorial enumeration. To date, however, the research
   literature has not yet captured the cognitive processes involved in
   taking such a perspective. In this theoretical paper, we elaborate the
   constructs of spatial structuring and spatial-numerical linked
   structuring from within our constructivist theoretical perspective to
   provide a cognitive account of how students conceptualize and generate
   combinatorial composites. Our elaborations emerged from analyzing and
   reflecting on data from two constructivist teaching experiments
   examining undergraduate students' combinatorial concepts, mental
   actions, and strategies. We define multiple constructs in our
   theoretical approach, including spatial-temporal-enactive (or S{*}-)
   structuring, two specific forms of S{*}-structuring (intra-composite and
   inter-composite structuring), numerical structuring, and S{*}-numerical
   linked structuring. We then illustrate how our framework can be used to
   analyze students' physical/mental actions and operations when engaging
   in combinatorial inquiry. Critically, our findings suggest that
   successful and meaningful combinatorial enumeration depends on
   constructing intra-composite S{*}-structuring for single combinatorial
   composites, then abstracting, reflecting on, generalizing, and linking
   this intra-composite structuring to an inter-composite structuring to
   generate the set of combinatorial composites. We conclude with a
   discussion of how our paper contributes to existing research on
   combinatorial reasoning.},

Abstract = {Recursive reasoning is a powerful tool used extensively in problem
   solving. For us, recursive reasoning includes iteration, sequences,
   difference equations, discrete dynamical systems, pattern
   identification, and mathematical induction; all of these can represent
   how things change, but in discrete jumps. Given the school mathematics
   curriculum's later emphasis on calculus-the mathematics of change in
   continuous contexts-it is surprising that the curriculum seems to
   neglect recursive thinking after the early grades. Research shows that
   recursion supports the learning of algebra among younger students, but
   the lack of similar research with older students is concerning. In this
   paper we suggest possible affordances from teaching recursive modeling,
   including a basic model of the spread of contagious diseases. We also
   discuss different ways to present these models at various points in the
   curriculum that might develop connections between mathematics and the
   real world, and support students' learning of mathematics. This leads to
   what we, as mathematicians, think would be interesting research
   questions for mathematical educators.},

Title = {Impacts of classroom teaching practices on students' mathematics

Abstract = {Teaching effectiveness is a core issue in educational research; however,
   there is little consensus about the most important results of classroom
   teaching from an international perspective. The effectiveness of
   teaching has remained a `black box' for a long time. In the secondary
   study described in this paper we used empirical data for Shanghai taken
   from the international Organization for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD) study Global Teaching InSights (GTI)-initially the
   Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) Video Study-which was
   based on videotaped direct observations of classroom teaching.
   Eighty-five junior high school mathematics teachers and their students
   in Shanghai were observed to explore the impact of specific teaching
   practices on students' interest, self-efficacy, and mathematics
   achievement scores. The results revealed that social-emotional support
   and instruction quality were the key dimensions relating to the
   characteristics and differences of mathematics lessons in Shanghai.
   While the former had a significantly positive impact on students'
   general mathematics self-efficacy, the latter had a significantly
   positive impact on students' mathematics interest. Although specific
   teaching practices had no significant direct impact on students'
   mathematics achievement scores, social-emotional support and instruction
   quality considerably influenced students' academic performance in an
   indirect way via general self-efficacy.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mathematics Challenge for Young Australians is a unique enrichment
   program that has been produced annually by the Australian Mathematics
   Trust since 1991. In its present form, it is divided into four levels
   and caters for talented students from years 3 to 10. In a typical year,
   it attracts over 15,000 entries. Individual schools arrange a period of
   up to four weeks in the first half of the academic year for students to
   work on their prescribed set of the problems and write full solutions.
   Limited collaboration among students is permitted and encouraged. There
   is a strong emphasis on articulating clearly the reasoning in solutions
   with sound and complete presentation. A guide containing marking schemes
   is provided for teachers to help them assess their students' work. It
   also includes discussion points and extension questions, which are
   relevant to each problem and may be used by the teacher for further
   enrichment activity. This paper discusses the history, aims, and
   structure of the program. It describes how problems are designed by the
   Challenge Committee to engage the students and develop their
   problem-solving skills. A range of past Challenge problems are presented
   to illustrate their construction, diversity, levels of difficulty, and
   relevance to educational objectives.},

Abstract = {Teacher dashboards in mathematics classrooms tend to provide teachers
   with information on student performance that are often linked to
   classroom management systems, online course systems, or peer-tutoring
   software. Teacher dashboards also tend to emphasize features that
   support teachers using a ``transition{''} or ``direct instruction{''}
   model. In our approach, we iteratively designed, developed, tested, and
   refined a teacher dashboard that is linked to a student digital
   collaborative environment with an embedded problem-based mathematics
   curriculum. In this study, we investigate teacher dashboard features
   that support teacher enactment of problem-based mathematics curriculum
   embedded in a digital collaborative platform. We report on design
   principles that guided the development of three teacher dashboard
   features: (1) monitoring evidence of student thinking in real-time or
   after class, (2) accessing workspace for whole-class discussions of the
   problem, and (3) creating and sending ``just-in-time{''} supports. The
   pedagogical advantages and challenges teachers face throughout the
   iterative development process are also discussed. Evidence from
   observational data and teacher interviews suggests that the organic
   synergism generated from the student and teacher digital platform offers
   several ways that teachers are provided with new and timely information
   from teacher dashboards that supports problem-based mathematics
   teaching.},

Abstract = {Micro-analysis of noticing is introduced as a method to analyze
   prospective teacher noticing, one that privileges the high variation
   exhibited by novice learners. The intent was to understand how
   prospective teachers' noticing moments suggest trajectories within and
   across whole-class discussions. We also focused on how prospective
   teachers' responses suggest individual trajectories of noticing in these
   discussions. We examined prospective teachers' engagement with a
   videocase curriculum in a mathematics content course in a teacher
   preparation program in the US. We contrast prospective teachers'
   development of noticing using commonly employed analytic methods in
   noticing research and discuss the limitations of these methods for
   characterizing prospective (novice) teacher development of noticing.
   Findings illustrate how a micro-analysis of noticing as an analytic
   method illuminates nuanced patterns of prospective teacher noticing in
   their development of learning to notice in both whole-class and
   individual scenarios.},

Abstract = {In this paper we examine changes to the national calculus curriculum of
   South Korea, where mathematics performance often serves as the mark of
   academic excellence. We describe relevant cultural traditions of
   mathematics education in South Korea, including the history of
   curricular changes in calculus at the secondary level. We then
   investigate how public discourse concerning a calculus curriculum
   revision is formed through issue framing, and analyze the public
   discourse among stakeholders in calculus education in South Korea. In
   addition, we present an analysis of the revised calculus curriculum at
   the high school level in relation to the issues raised by stakeholder
   groups. Further, we reflect on how culture, research, and policy can
   collectively inform curricular changes and educational policies. Last,
   we discuss the role of mathematics education research in facilitating
   the balanced formation of public discourse and in supporting teachers'
   professional autonomy to provide meaningful calculus education to
   students. The findings suggest a need for building clear boundaries of
   roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in developing and revising
   national curricula, and for using research evidence in curriculum

Abstract = {Aspects of noticing which are often overlooked are brought to the
   surface and illustrated by accounting-for three accounts-of specific
   phenomena, two of which readers are invited to experience for
   themselves. These are used as a springboard for both illustrating the
   Discipline of Noticing as a method of sensitising oneself to notice
   possibilities for action, and reporting insights achieved through its
   use. This includes augmenting the discourse of Dual Systems Theory to
   include S1.5 (emotion) and S3 (creative insight) and linking it to a
   six-fold structure of the human psyche (enaction, affect, cognition,
   attention, will and witness). The aim is to enrich the discourse in
   which to account-for incidents as experienced by teachers themselves,
   and incidents observed by teachers and other researchers. The paper ends
   by distinguishing between measurement-based research validation, and
   phenomenologically-based validation which is part of the discipline of
   noticing.},

Title = {<i>Math MOOC UniTo</i>: an Italian project on MOOCs for mathematics
   teacher education, and the development of a new theoretical framework},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on MOOCs (massive open online courses), a fairly
   recent paradigm in e-learning educational projects. Despite the high
   dropout rate, and the impossibility of benefiting from the opportunities
   that bring with it a face-to-face dialogue, several factors make MOOCs a
   good option for ongoing teacher professional learning. The MOOCs on
   which we focus address mathematics teacher education. In particular, we
   illustrate our experience based on four MOOCs that we organized in Italy
   in the last 4 years within theMath MOOC UniToproject, the aim of which
   is the professional development of mathematics in-service teachers. In
   the paper we articulate the conceptual framework that has guided the
   design, data collection, analysis and interpretation of findings for the
   project. It is mainly based on the hybridization of the meta-didactical
   transposition (MDT) model with the instrumentation/instrumentalization
   processes of the instrumental approach and the network of knowledge of
   Connectivism. We offer this new framework (called MOOC-MDT) to stimulate
   discussion with colleagues in the mathematics education research
   community about ways in which it might be refined and extended, towards
   building a shared understanding of the process of mathematics teacher
   education through MOOCs.},

Abstract = {Many studies provide insights into students' conceptions of various
   linear algebra topics and difficulties they face with multiple modes of
   thinking needed for conceptualization. While it is important to
   understand students' initial conceptions, students' transfer of learning
   of these conceptions to subsequent courses can provide additional
   information to structure meaningful curricular materials. This study
   explores physics students' transfer of learning of eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors from prerequisite experiences to quantum mechanics. Data
   analysis focused on three task-based interviews with undergraduate
   students, observations of physics courses, and students' course
   artifacts. Existing studies on students' conceptions of linear algebra
   topics indicate the necessity of developing flexible shifts between
   different modes of thinking in order to grasp linear algebra. This
   study's participants, who had initial learning experiences of linear
   algebra, were also observed to struggle with such shifts prior to
   quantum courses. It seems that various contexts in quantum courses, and
   explicit instructional methods, provided opportunities for students to
   enhance this initial learning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In
   particular, the explicit reasoning of one of the quantum courses'
   instructors concerning the choice of certain representations during
   problem solving in class, seemed to facilitate students' construction of
   similarities, thus providing evidence for actor-oriented transfer.
   Results of this study align with goals for recently developed
   instructional materials and interventions that emphasize opportunities
   for students to inquire and connect multiple modes of thinking.},

Abstract = {Health-related decisions make use of numeracy skills, for example
   counting medication dosages, extracting health-related information from
   food packaging or understanding statistical data. Even though the
   concept of health literacy is often used to explain health disparities
   (Freedman et al., in American Journal of Preventive Medicine 36:446-451,
   2009), discourses that differentiate between health literacy and health
   numeracy are emerging. Golbeck et al. (American Journal of Preventive
   Medicine 29:375-376, 2005) defined health numeracy as ``the degree to
   which individuals have the capacity to access, process, interpret,
   communicate, and act on numerical, quantitative, graphical,
   biostatistical, and probabilistic health information needed to make
   effective health decisions{''} (p. 375). To determine which numeracy
   skills impact health and health practices, the present study examines
   the 2015 German extension of the Programme for the International
   Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) survey, which collected data on
   numeracy skills and numeracy practices and on the perception of health
   and health practices (as in the socio-economic panel, SOEP). Further, it
   indicates which numeracy practices (or the lack of these) might play a
   part in poor health and in (health) vulnerability in Germany.},

   research are often seen in terms of either/or, such as the individual or
   the social, the discursive or the bodily, the classroom interactive or
   the neurological events, the humanist or the post-humanist. We propose
   stratigraphy as a research (meta-)method that is conjunctive rather than
   disjunctive, resisting the temptation to collapse these different
   interpretations into a single, convergent narrative. Using a classroom
   episode involving young children working on counting with digital
   technology, and drawing primarily on the work of Gilles Deleuze and
   Etienne Souriau, we describe the philosophical assumptions of
   stratigraphy and show what stratigraphy might look like for mathematics
   education research. We aim to contribute to on-going discussions about
   how to handle different theories that are used in mathematics education,
   as well as the question of how to frame their current and future
   relationships.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a survey of body studies in mathematics education.
   Building on earlier insights about the `embodied mind', which focused
   primarily on individual, intact bodies, we focus on recent work that
   elaborates bodies as distributed and extended and fully implicated in
   socio-material ecologies of learning. The aim of this article is to map
   current trends in this domain, and to articulate some of the current
   challenges. Because bodies matter differently depending on the research
   perspective, and because they are studied at multiple scales of
   mattering (neurological, sensory-gestural, affective, social,
   institutional, national, etc.), there tends to be disparate insights
   across the field with little to no cross-fertilization. This paper aims
   to open up conversations across different theoretical approaches-and
   scales of mattering-so as to create a more expansive and inclusive
   agenda for body studies in the field of mathematics education. We have
   chosen to organise our survey around five themes that seem dominant in
   the literature, where key theoretical and methodological trends can be
   discerned. These are: (1) groups, systems, ecologies (2) affect,
   movement, sensation, (3) language-use and gesture, (4) dis/ability and
   power, (5) technology, technicity, and tools. We argue that these
   different approaches need to be in conversation with each other, to
   think across research contexts, problems and communities, so that new
   forms of inquiry and new insights can emerge.},

Abstract = {Comprehending a mathematical modelling task is a central prerequisite
   for the following modelling process. In this study, we investigated the
   roles that the language proficiency of the students and the linguistic
   wording of the task play for the comprehension and the successful
   solving of mathematical modelling tasks. Five mathematical tasks with a
   constant modelling complexity and a varied linguistic complexity were
   developed. 634 students of comprehensive schools were tested and their
   socio-demographic factors as well as their language proficiency were
   measured. The results show a strong relationship between language
   proficiency and mathematical modelling achievement. Moreover, the
   findings suggest that increasing the linguistic complexity of
   mathematical modelling tasks results in lower solution frequencies.},

Abstract = {Interest has long been regarded as an important motivational construct
   in the learning of mathematics. It has been contended that the
   development of interest is directed by two control systems: an emotional
   and a cognitive. Under the former, students are attracted to activities
   that are enjoyable, whereas under the latter they consciously engage in
   tasks that might satisfy, for example, later goals. Younger students are
   more likely to associate emotional responses to interest-related
   stimuli, whereas older students tend to associate cognitive responses,
   suggesting qualitative developmental differences for students' interest
   in mathematics. Yet there are differences between the classroom
   motivational environments experienced by primary/elementary vs.
   secondary school students, and the mathematical interest and enthusiasm
   likely felt and expressed by primary vs. secondary teachers, which may
   influence dimensions of student interest. Of concern in this study is
   the extent to which teacher enthusiasm impacts the classroom
   motivational environments (mastery vs. performance goal orientation)
   perceived by students and reported by teachers, and thereby dimensions
   of students' interest for mathematics. Using survey data from 471
   students in Grades 3-10 and 44 of their mathematics teachers, we find
   that students' perceptions of their teachers' enthusiasm for teaching
   mathematics positively predict their perceptions of a classroom mastery
   environment, which in turn predicts their interest. However, at the
   class-level, teachers' enthusiasm for the subject of mathematics
   negatively predicts the emotional interest of their students.
   Implications of these results are discussed.},

Abstract = {Using data provided by an empirical exploratory study with mathematics
   undergraduates, this paper discusses some key variables in the
   interaction between affective and cognitive dimensions in the perplexity
   state in problem solving. These variables are as follows: heuristics,
   mathematical processes, appraisal processes {[}pleasantness, attentional
   activity, control (self-other responsibility/control, situational
   control), certainty, goal-path obstacle, anticipated effort and mental
   flexibility], as well as the relationships these variables have with
   different emotions that make up perplexity. Fuzzy sets were introduced
   as a tool to capture and accurately reflect the diversity and
   subjectivity in the interplay between cognition and emotion. The
   descriptive analysis of the responses to a fuzzy rating scale-based
   questionnaire shows the interaction between variables linked to the
   dimensions of control and certainty and students' ability to cope with
   perplexity in performance in mathematics. The study also adds novel
   considerations related to the function and interaction of mathematics
   cognitive processes that are linked to appraisal processes, namely, the
   perception of goal-path obstacle, attentional activity and mental
   flexibility that contributes to the ability to solve simpler problem
   components involved in mathematical performance.},

Title = {Discussing students' thinking and perspectives for improving teaching:
   An analysis of teachers' reflection in post-lesson discussions in lesson

Abstract = {Lesson study is a Japanese concept to improve teaching and learning
   mathematics through a particular form of activity in which a group of
   teachers works collaboratively to plan, implement, observe, and reflect
   on the proposed research lessons. Although lesson study is
   internationally acknowledged as providing key learning opportunities for
   teachers, there is limited information on post-lesson discussion and its
   contribution toward teachers' professional growth. This study has the
   aim of describing the key features of post-lesson discussions. An entire
   group of teachers at a public elementary school in Japan participated in
   three lesson study cycles. During the post-lesson discussion in each
   cycle, the teachers were invited to write down what they believed was
   significant in the planned lesson and their comments regarding the
   lessons, for the discussion. The writings and comments were collected
   and analyzed. This method helped capture teachers' `voices' better
   compared to recordings of oral discussion. The results of the analyses
   of teachers' writings and comments revealed that a major part of
   post-lesson discussions involved issues related to pedagogies, and
   teachers' reflections tended to focus more on students' thinking and
   mathematical topics over time as the cycles of lesson study proceeded.
   The results suggested that teachers' professional growth can be related
   to their recognition of the importance of understanding students'
   thinking and their perspectives on mathematics, in order to improve
   teaching.},

Abstract = {David Clarke's research has shifted the focus of classroom research in
   mathematics education from study of cultural patterns to study of
   patterns of participation and the learning that can result in highly
   complex social environments. His Complementary Accounts Methodology
   which informed the Learner's Perspective Study design included
   multi-source data collection generated through the latest technological
   advances at that time. That research design enriched the author's
   doctoral research which was situated within the Learner's Perspective
   Study. One intention of this paper is to highlight ways in which
   Clarke's methodology added to the richness of the study Williams
   undertook, in particular, the flexibility of Clarke's methodology in
   enabling adaptation to support a theoretical framework that included but
   extended beyond social theories of learning. In doing so, this paper
   draws attention to an aspect of Clarke's methodological legacy, the
   potential for his Complementary Accounts Methodology to contribute to
   support of researchers employing diverse theoretical frameworks.},

Abstract = {In the research reported in this paper, using a modified version of the
   interconnected model of teacher professional growth (IMTPG) proposed by
   Clarke and Hollingsworth (Teaching Teacher Educ 18:947-967, 2002), we
   aimed to understand the learning dynamics in a lesson study of a group
   of five teachers of grades 5-6, during their work around mathematical
   tasks and in the elaboration and analysis of a diagnostic test of
   students' knowledge. We draw on examples from a lesson study that took
   place in a school in Lisbon, involving five teachers that constituted
   the whole mathematics group of the school. The main feature of our
   adaptation is the consideration of a Group Domain instead of the
   Personal Domain of the original model. In the original model, the Domain
   of Practice had a broad definition but usually it was restricted to
   classroom experimentation. In the research reported in this paper, the
   lesson study sessions were taken as part of the Domain of Practice. For
   data collection, there was audio and video recording of the lesson study
   sessions and of the research lesson and the writing of a research
   journal. Data analysis was done using the modified IMTPG. The results
   suggest that this model is helpful in understanding the processes that
   make lesson study a valuable professional development setting,
   contributing to responding to the question of `how lesson study works'
   (Lewis et al., Theory and practices of lesson study in mathematics: an
   international perspective, Springer, New York, 2019). In addition, the
   use of this model showed that the lesson study promoted the teachers'
   development regarding knowledge of didactics, especially knowledge of
   students and their learning processes and of teaching practice.},

Abstract = {In this paper we report the results of a study in which we investigated
   how formal education and shadow education in Taiwan provide students
   opportunities to learn mathematics. Based on the conceptual framework of
   Opportunity to Learn (OTL), aspects specific to formal education,
   including mathematics curriculum, mathematics textbooks, and teachers'
   competence, and their teaching, were reviewed. Two national projects
   identified under shadow education were examined. The results revealed
   significant features of the mathematics curriculum, textbook design, and
   the quality of mathematics teachers in Taiwan that constitute a lived
   space where teachers with their knowledge and beliefs, curriculum,
   textbooks, and school settings, can generate cognitive and affective
   learning outcomes in students. Further analyses of the two
   above-mentioned projects showed how Taiwan extended learning
   opportunities to motivate students to learn and understand school
   mathematics. Based on the review, challenges were also identified.},

Abstract = {Mathematical creativity is considered beneficial for learning
   mathematics. However, research studies that provide empirical evidence
   of students' mathematical creativity in regular mathematics classrooms
   are relatively scarce. This study explores the idea of mini-creativity
   (mini-c), which is defined as the creative processes involved in the
   construction of personal knowledge and understanding. The aim of the
   study is the identification and characterization of mini-c instances
   when students are first introduced to the arithmetic mean concept. In
   total, 97 Grade 6 students participated in a technologically enhanced
   instructional program which was developed according to the principles of
   the theoretical framework `personalised mathematics and mathematics
   inquiry' (PMMI). The analysis of the results suggests that the learning
   environment supported the development of mini-c. From students'
   worksheets and classroom observations, three categories of mini-c
   instances were identified and characterized, as follows: (a) building
   insight and abstractness of a mathematical concept; (b) creating,
   manipulating, and connecting representations; and (c) expressing
   flexible thinking.},

Abstract = {Fostering conceptual understanding in mathematics classrooms is an
   important goal in mathematics education. To support this goal, we need
   to be able to diagnose and assess the extent to which students have
   conceptual understanding. In this study we employed a problem-posing
   task and a problem-solving task in order to diagnose and assess
   preservice teachers' mathematical understanding of fraction division.
   The results of the study show that although over 99\% of the preservice
   teachers could correctly perform fraction division, they were much less
   likely to exhibit conceptual understanding of fraction division either
   through a problem-solving task involving graphical representation or
   through a problem-posing task. However, engaging in problem posing
   appears to more likely than making a graphical representation to elicit
   preservice teachers' conceptual understanding. Moreover, a conceptual
   cue about the meaning of fraction division appears to greatly increase
   the likelihood that preservice teachers will exhibit conceptual
   understanding of fraction division in their posed problems and generate
   conceptually based diagrams of fraction division. The findings highlight
   the usefulness of problem-posing tasks for diagnosing and assessing
   preservice teachers' mathematical understanding.},

Abstract = {Students need to create mental models for different types of addition
   and subtraction situations in order to develop a broad and viable
   understanding of these operations. Although most students succeed when
   changing or combining sets, situations that demand a quantitative
   comparison of sets seem considerably more difficult in the first school
   year. Textbooks represent the most important learning resource for
   elementary school mathematics teachers. However, research on their
   impact on students' knowledge is limited. Hence, we examined textbooks'
   role in students' ability to model quantitative comparisons by analyzing
   the learning opportunities presented by four German textbooks for Grade
   1 and by conducting a secondary analysis of a dataset based on 1513
   students from 84 classes that used one of these textbooks. The results
   revealed differences in the textbooks' topic-specific instructional
   quality as well as a significant relation between this quality and
   student achievement in quantitative comparisons.},

Abstract = {The influence of language and situation structure on the difficulty of
   word problems has been investigated intensively in the field of
   mathematics education. However, instructional approaches to overcoming
   students' difficulties are still not widely available. This paper
   describes an intervention to develop second graders' skills in handling
   additive word problems flexibly. During ten small-group sessions of 40
   min, two strategies to restructure the situation described in a word
   problem were introduced: (1) changing the direction of mathematical
   relations and (2) changing semantic structures. The introduction of
   these strategies was supported using macro-scaffolding. The development
   of students' flexibility in dealing with arithmetic situations during
   the intervention was analyzed in a longitudinal case study focusing on
   four students, who were preselected from a larger sample based on their
   language skills. We examined audio data and student work by applying
   qualitative content analysis. Students' development in handling word
   problems flexibly was compared with the intended learning trajectory in
   the intervention. The results provide insights into potential key
   processes when gaining flexibility, and yield information on the
   necessary adaptations of the learning trajectory.},

Abstract = {There is a disconnect between what most curricular documents suggest
   about connecting classroom pedagogy with learners' language and everyday
   context, and what the language of mathematics textbooks and the language
   of mathematics classroom practices present. Attempting to bridge this
   gap is often a design challenge for classroom teaching practices that
   face multiple languages during mathematics learning processes. In this
   paper I discuss results from a teaching design experiment for fostering
   meaning, using language support, in a middle grades mathematics
   classroom. I analyse the complexities and challenges that arise, as a
   way forward for purposefully relating with teaching practice. Following
   the design principles of connecting students' language varieties and
   engaging them in rich discourse practices during lessons, in this paper
   I show that enabling shifts in classroom norms by moving from oral to
   written mathematics, and moving from private to public and shared
   expressions, fostered meaning making and empowered students'
   mathematical communication. Data are drawn from an empirical study
   conducted in a low-income community engaged in micro-enterprises
   dispersed among households in India. Children in the community have
   access to the work-contexts and hence to the mathematical knowledge and
   language repertoires embedded in them.},

Abstract = {Implementing innovations in mathematics education relies on scaling up
   professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers. Within the
   German Center of Mathematics Teacher Education (DZLM), the complexities
   involved in scaling-up processes are addressed with three implementation
   strategies: a material, a personnel, and a systemic strategy. For each
   of them, the research base is empirically established by design research
   and intervention studies. The personnel strategy focuses on preparing
   teachers for innovative teaching approaches and on preparing PD
   facilitators for conducting PDs on the content involved. The empirical
   research required for creating a research base for the personnel
   strategy investigates what teachers and facilitators need to know about
   their learners (students on the classroom level, teachers on the PD
   level) with regard to a specific (PD) content. The main focus of the
   material strategy is to provide support for teachers and facilitators by
   adaptable curriculum materials for classrooms and PD sessions. The
   empirical research on the material strategies focuses on how such
   material needs to be constructed to ensure both flexibility and fidelity
   for impactful quality implementation. The systemic strategy involves
   considering the systemic contexts on each level and cooperating with the
   respective stakeholders (e.g., school principals or regional PD
   authorities). The corresponding empirical research focuses on the
   interplay of processes and systemic conditions. In this paper, we
   present the implementation strategies on different levels, and typical
   research approaches and results for strengthening their empirical and
   theoretical bases.},

Abstract = {In dealing with over-indebtedness and poverty, numeracy appears
   necessary for affected persons, in order to use the scarce money
   available with foresight and to avoid financially negative decisions.
   However, numeracy as an essential part of (financial) basic education
   for adults has not yet been systematically taken into account in German
   debt counselling. Nor are the difficult conditions concerning
   over-indebted life situations considered sufficiently in theoretical
   models of numeracy or financial literacy. There is a lack of knowledge
   in adult mathematics education about the mathematical requirements in
   the context of over-indebtedness and the numeracy practices of persons
   affected. In this paper we therefore intend to clarify the understanding
   and significance of numeracy practices in over-indebted life situations
   from the perspective of German debt-counselling professionals. The
   empirical basis comprises qualitative data of two group interviews with
   debt-counselling professionals (n = 11). Amongst other things, our
   findings show the complexity of contextual factors in mathematical
   demands and numeracy practices in precarious living situations, which
   can help to develop current thinking on numeracy and financial literacy.},

Abstract = {Teaching mathematics requires a wide range of knowledge, including types
   of mathematical knowledge specialized to the work of teaching. Because
   specialized content knowledge is a form of professional knowledge, it is
   important to emphasize in professional preparation. In this paper, we
   present results comparing the performance of prospective and practicing
   teachers on the Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) assessments.
   While the results show that practicing teachers score higher on the LMT
   assessments than prospective teachers, only about half of the individual
   items are significantly more difficult for prospective teachers. To gain
   a more nuanced understanding of the mathematical knowledge assessed by
   the LMT items, we also compared the performance of prospective and
   practicing teachers for items organized by the mathematical work of
   teaching. We discuss implications for identifying types of professional
   mathematical knowledge important to emphasize in teacher education.},

Abstract = {This commentary combines the insights offered by the contributors to
   this special issue into one consistent whole, a single story of identity
   and the learning of mathematics. Its somewhat unusual formatthe story is
   told in an interview granted by the Ideal Mathematics Education
   Researcher to a journalistsignals that the author addresses the
   narrative not only to her fellow academics, but also to practitioners
   and the general public. As the story unfolds, the commentator reflects
   on the current state of research and invites her colleagues to harness
   their insights on identity and learning while taking a critical look at
   their own work.},

Abstract = {Ethnomethodological approaches to research such as Interactionism,
   Conversation Analysis and Discursive Psychology have so far played only
   a small part in mathematics education research. This is in contrast to
   the wider use of these approaches in language education, medical
   discourse research, and legal discourse research. This article outlines
   the key principles an ethnomethodological approach follows, the methods
   used and the necessary reconceptualisation of some key concepts that are
   the focus of much mathematics education research. These are illustrated
   with some key examples from research in mathematics education, before
   looking at other fields for potential opportunities not yet realised
   within research in mathematics classrooms. These opportunities include a
   range of research questions already receiving a great deal of attention
   within the field but are yet to be examined from an ethnomethodological
   perspective. They also include new approaches that involve combining
   different research approaches which have been used to great effect in
   other fields.},

Abstract = {The transition from classical to electronic textbooks seems to be a
   logical step in the digitization advancing worldwide. However,
   developing an e-book ought to be more than digitizing text: key features
   of computer-based learning environments such as interactive exercises,
   adaptive demands, or automatic feedback should be integrated to take
   advantage of the digitization. The ``ALICE:fractions{''} project aims at
   designing and evaluating an interactive mathematics textbook for
   introducing fractions in the classroom. It is based on research in
   mathematics education and includes the elements just mentioned. This
   paper describes the electronic textbook's implementation and its
   theoretical background. Moreover, it introduces aspects that allow
   further information on learning processes to be gleaned. As an example,
   time on task is regarded in a study with 6th graders who used the
   electronic textbook in the classroom. Linear mixed models revealed a
   negative effect of time on task on task success. The effect was
   moderated by exercise difficulty and slightly by student competence: the
   effect was less pronounced in difficult exercises and for low-achieving
   students, whereas for high-achieving students or in easier exercises,
   the effect intensified.},

Abstract = {In the Netherlands, mathematics textbooks are a decisive influence on
   the enacted curriculum. About a decade ago, Dutch primary school
   mathematics textbooks provided hardly any opportunities to learn problem
   solving. In this study we investigated whether this provision has
   changed. In order to do so, we carried out a textbook analysis in which
   we established to what degree current textbooks provide non-routine
   problem-solving tasks for which students do not immediately have a
   particular solution strategy at their disposal. We also analyzed to what
   degree textbooks provide `gray-area' tasks, which are not really
   non-routine problems, but are also not straightforwardly solvable. In
   addition, we inventoried other ways in which present textbooks
   facilitate the opportunity to learn problem solving. Finally, we
   researched how inclusive these textbooks are with respect to offering
   opportunities to learn problem solving for students with varying
   mathematical abilities. The results of our study show that the
   opportunities that the currently most widely used Dutch textbooks offer
   to learn problem solving are very limited, and these opportunities are
   mainly offered in materials meant for more able students. In this
   regard, Dutch mainstream textbooks have not changed compared to the
   situation a decade ago. A textbook that is the Dutch edition of a
   Singapore mathematics textbook stands out in offering the highest number
   of problem-solving tasks, and in offering these in the materials meant
   for all students. However, in the ways this textbook facilitates the
   opportunity to learn problem solving, sometimes a tension occurs
   concerning the creative character of genuine problem solving.},

Abstract = {In educational contexts, assessments may be designed to target students,
   preservice teachers, or teachers, either as individuals or as
   representatives of a group, and for a multitude of purposes. One key aim
   of assessment in mathematics education is to provide evidence that can
   be used to make decisions about or improve mathematics education, which
   then raises questions about which aspects of mathematical competence
   should be assessed-as well as how and for what purpose. This review
   paper addresses three related themes: (1) issues related to the
   assessment process and to the development of assessments that can
   validly assess mathematical competence in all its complexity; (2) issues
   related to educational policy and policy-making based on assessment
   data, in particular the reciprocal relationship between assessment and
   policy; and (3) issues related to equity, such as gender issues or the
   achievement gap between majority and minority students. Awareness of the
   relation between assessment, teaching, and learning is shown throughout
   the paper. Strong relationships between the three focus areas are found,
   that impact assessment validity and call for further development of
   assessment practices in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {This research was conducted during an online continuing education course
   for mathematics teachers, whose core focus was modeling and
   applications. We studied the interactions of one group of two teachers,
   who worked collectively in posing and solving a modeling problem through
   a closed group on the social network Facebook. The research question
   guiding this paper was how the development of mathematical modeling
   occurs from an Activity Theory perspective, recognizing tensions that
   occur, and its evolution in the process of posing and solving a modeling
   problem. The researchers took a qualitative approach, analyzing
   discursive manifestations in the modeling process. In the discussion,
   contradictions emerged in the group through events such as dilemma and
   conflict. The results indicate that the modeling task acted as an
   artifact that brought to light inner contradictions, and thus, allowed
   teachers to move from a conflict to the formulation of an open problem,
   and from a dilemma to the construction of a model and a pedagogic
   strategy.},

Abstract = {One important goal of teacher education has been to improve pre-service
   teachers' understanding of the connection between real-life events and
   mathematics. Toward this goal, we designed two mathematics teacher
   education courses based on the Models-and-Modeling Perspective. This
   study presents a three-tier modeling investigation of (a) pre-service
   teachers' views about characteristics of realistic mathematics problems,
   and (b) teacher-level skills required to write such problems. A team of
   researchers analyzed 15 pre-service mathematics teachers' written
   artifacts and audio recordings of their discussion by employing the data
   analysis methods of constructivist grounded theory. In these two
   modeling-based courses, pre-service teachers completed several modeling
   cycles, during which they exhibited significant changes in their
   understandings about the characteristics of realistic problems and the
   skills that are needed to write-revise-refine such problems. The results
   thus indicated that modeling-based courses helped pre-service teachers
   think critically about stereotypical textbook problems, view realistic
   contexts as a medium through which mathematical ideas could be reasoned,
   understand the mathematical residuals of lessons involving realistic
   problems, and attain the skills needed to write and revise such
   problems. Hence, the modeling perspective provided an effective approach
   for pre-service mathematics teacher training, ensuring pre-service
   teachers' development as they express-test-revise-refine their thinking,
   understandings, and skills.},

Abstract = {In this paper I introduce a methodological approach that can be useful
   for investigating relationships between mathematics tasks, mathematical
   classroom cultures and mathematics learning. This proposal responds to a
   need, identified in the literature, for ``further research which uses
   alternative methods to understand student perspectives more fully,
   particularly in the context of innovative task design{''} (Ainley and
   Margolinas, Task design in mathematics education, Springer, Switzerland,
   2015, p. 20). Influenced by enactivism, classroom cultures are
   characterised through patterns in students' effective behaviours.
   Mathematics learning is defined as changes in effective behaviours which
   result from noticing features such as mathematical structure and which
   allow the learner to act differently in a given mathematical context.
   The following aspects were used as starting points to explore students'
   behaviours and to characterise different cultures: active/passive,
   attentive/inattentive, working with others/working individually,
   freedom/constraint, giving correct answers/formulating explanations,
   knowing how and knowing why/remembering. Examples from two large-scale
   Mexican projects show how different tasks emerge in different contexts
   and how this emergence is interconnected with different patterns in
   effective behaviours and with mathematics learning. Characterising
   classroom cultures and sharing different ways of working in the
   classroom, which might give rise to different tasks, are offered as
   possibilities for taking students' and teachers' perspectives more fully
   into account in task design.},

Title = {Interventions and diversity, equity, and inclusion: Two current
   directions in research on the teaching and learning of calculus},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 25},
Abstract = {Calculus continues to be an important topic of discussion among
   mathematics education researchers given how it often acts as a
   gatekeeper for students in STEM. In their extensive 2017 review of
   calculus literature, Larsen and colleagues identified two main areas of
   applied research that had largely been neglected: research related (1)
   to efforts to improve calculus teaching and learning and (2) to equity
   and social justice. In this review we investigate how scholars have
   answered this call by reviewing recent literature related to these two
   themes. First we identified some promising intervention studies that
   investigated changes at the course level (e.g., calculus courses
   intended for engineering students) and at the level of specific calculus
   topics (e.g. using digital tools to help students understand the
   Fundamental Theorem). Second, we identified several studies on
   diversity, equity, and inclusion. We found that some studies in this
   collection still approached this research through traditional methods
   (e.g., so called achievement gaps) but we also identified promising new
   directions for research in which scholars utilize critical theories and
   provide counter-narratives that highlight the strengths of calculus
   students from historically marginalized groups. We conclude our review
   by discussing future directions we hope to see in the field that we
   argue will strengthen current work.},

Abstract = {Based on an opportunity-use model of instructional quality, this study
   investigates the extent to which subject-specific instructional quality
   rated by experts is reflected in students' assessments of their own
   learning and understanding, and how students' perceptions predict their
   achievement. The analyses used data from a German-Swiss sample of 36
   classes with around 900 lower secondary students, obtained as part of
   the so-called ``Pythagoras study{''} in the school year 2002/2003. The
   teachers were instructed to introduce the Pythagorean theorem in three
   lessons, which were videotaped. Using the videos, the experts assessed
   the instruction quality with respect to the goal of promoting a deep
   understanding of the theorem. The students completed the questionnaires
   assessing their understanding of the content, their learning process,
   and the general comprehension orientation of the teacher. The results
   showed significant and moderate correlations on the class level between
   expert-rated subject-specific teaching quality and students' perceptions
   of their own learning and understanding, as well as of the teacher's
   general comprehension orientation. Multilevel models revealed that
   subject-specific expert ratings are reflected in individual students'
   perceptions of their own learning and understanding. Student perceptions
   were also associated with achievement gains. The results suggest that
   the assessment of quality by students and experts is more closely linked
   if a distinction is made between the quality of the learning
   opportunities offered and their use and if subject-specific criteria are
   used instead of generic criteria. This study contributes to a more
   nuanced understanding of the validity of student perspective in
   assessing instructional quality.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how different approaches in mathematics education
   conceptualise the relationship between school mathematics and university
   mathematics. The approaches considered here include: (a) Klein's
   elementary mathematics from a higher standpoint; (b) Shulman's
   transformation of disciplinary subject matter into subject matter for
   teaching; and (c) Chevallard's didactic transposition of scholarly
   knowledge into knowledge to be taught. Similarities and contrasts
   between these three approaches are discussed in terms of how they frame
   the relationship between the academic discipline and the school subject,
   and to what extent they problematise the reliance and bias towards the
   academic discipline. The institutional position implicit in the three
   approaches is then examined in order to open up new ways of thinking
   about the relationship between school mathematics and university
   mathematics.},

Title = {Generalisation in students with autism spectrum disorder: an exploratory

Abstract = {Generalisation is a skill that enables learners to acquire knowledge in
   general, and mathematical knowledge in particular. It is a core aspect
   of algebraic thinking and, in particular, of functional thinking, as a
   type of algebraic thinking. Introducing primary school children to
   functional thinking fosters their ability to generalise, explain and
   reason with mathematical relationships. It also helps them overcome
   difficulties in understanding functions when they are exposed to the
   idea more formally in secondary education. Although more and more
   special education students are enrolled in mainstream schools, little is
   known about algebraic thinking in that community, especially in the case
   of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Students with ASD often
   exhibit deficits that interfere directly with mathematical learning. The
   study discussed here, which was conducted in the context of algebraic
   reasoning, was aimed primarily at identifying and describing the
   strategies and representations observed in 26 ASD primary education
   students when performing a task that involved a linear function, and
   describing the generalisations they performed. The 26 participants were
   enrolled in 19 mainstream Spanish schools. The tools used, a
   questionnaire and semi-structured interview, were designed to explore
   their ability to generalise in a problem involving the function f(x) =
   2x + 2. The strategies identified included: (a) bald answering; (b)
   modelling with manipulatives; (c) drawing; (d) counting and (e)
   operating. The strategy most frequently observed was operating,
   represented verbally or symbolically, followed by drawing. Only three
   students generalised but did not reach the highest level of functional
   thinking, namely, `functions as objects'. The results are compared with
   findings for mainstream students of similar ages. Conjectures around the
   possible relationships between some findings and the type of thinking
   characteristic of autism spectrum disorder are put forward. The results
   carry implications for research with and teaching of students with ASD.},

Abstract = {Relational thinking and dealing with variables are two essential aspects
   of algebraic thinking. Relational thinking means viewing mathematical
   expressions and equations as a whole rather than as individual computing
   processes. It is characterized by using relationships between
   mathematical objects, and refers to the relations of equality and
   inequality. In this study, to examine the relational thinking of
   kindergarten and primary school children, this perspective was applied
   using non-symbolic representations in the form of boxes and marbles.
   Using multiple variables is a very powerful but also difficult tool of
   algebra. The study had the aim of examining how kindergarten children
   and primary school children establish relationships between several
   variables which are represented with real materials. The interview study
   was conducted with children aged 5-10 years. Marbles and different
   colored boxes represented equations with unknowns and quantities
   depending on each other. Initially, two approaches could be
   differentiated, namely, number-oriented and structure-oriented
   approaches. It could be shown that certain conceptualizations of
   variables were related to children's ability to show relational
   thinking. Kindergarteners are stimulated to think relationally by
   unknown quantities which can be determined. This process was observed in
   primary school children dealing with quantities that depended on each
   other. In addition, the conceptualization of the variables represented
   as boxes was examined. The concepts of general number and variable as
   changing quantity were categorized. Further conceptualizations resulted
   from the interview data, namely, categories of the undeterminable, the
   specific number, and the quasi-general.},

Abstract = {In mathematics education, translation of resources from one language to
   another occurs in a wide range of situations. This paper explores how
   conceptual and technical apparatus from contemporary translation studies
   may be of use in guiding and analysing such translation. Key
   concepts-including those of source, target and intermediate text, of
   paradigms of equivalence, purpose, uncertainty and localisation, and of
   semantic, syntactic and epistemological equivalence-are introduced and
   illustrated, primarily with reference to translation of a series of
   school mathematics workbooks. Significant types of tool to assist
   translation-translation protocols and machine translation-are examined.
   A more detailed case study illustrates techniques (and associated tools)
   for analysing translation shifts and terminological translatability,
   applying them to examine translation of documentation of a framework for
   researching teachers' interaction with resources-the Documentational
   Approach to Didactics. Specific insights that emerge are how translation
   is shaped by attention not just to fidelity to the source text but to
   the audience for, and function of, the target text; and how challenging
   it can be to formulate terms translatable across languages in such a way
   as to consistently anchor meaning in existing wordforms.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I report the results of a study of a large-scale
   implementation of an evidence-based, objective-oriented approach to
   teaching via digital platforms among mathematics teachers in Denmark.
   The aim of the study was to investigate how these platforms affect the
   work of mathematics teachers and how emergent problems in this process
   can be addressed from an implementation perspective. This objective was
   achieved by applying concepts from the theory of instrumental genesis to
   analyze ethnographical data of teachers' platform usage and data from
   participatory workshops. The results of the study indicate that the
   design of platforms is likely to conflict with the needs of mathematics
   teachers and thus I argue for the need of addressing such issues by
   supporting teachers in enacting innovations rather than by redesigning
   them. Furthermore, in the paper I suggest that future workshop is an
   adequate format to support such enactments.},

Abstract = {This paper belongs to a field of research that has appeared
   comparatively recently, namely, the study of mathematics competitions.
   The paper utilizes historical-theoretical methodology and is devoted to
   changes in the way in which mathematics competitions have been conducted
   in Russia in recent decades. Mathematics competitions, like mathematics
   education as a whole, are seen as part of a social process, and changes
   in them are seen as expressions of new social needs and possibilities.
   The analysis of the system of competitions, as it evolved in the USSR,
   and the literature devoted to them, makes it possible to identify
   certain challenges recognized by the mathematics community. In this
   paper I discuss examples of new competitions that have emerged to
   address these challenges. It is noted that new types of competitions
   have emerged, including team competitions and competitions involving
   mass participation by students. Also discussed is the emergence of new
   competitions with subject matter closer to that of ordinary school
   mathematics than that of old, traditional competitions. An analysis of
   the situation in Russia reveals the existence of a significant group of
   mathematics educators, parents, and children interested in the
   development of mathematics competitions. Also, in the paper I call
   attention to certain questions that I consider worthy of further study.},

Abstract = {Existing literature reviews of calculus learning made an important
   contribution to our understanding of the development of mathematics
   education research in this area, particularly their documentation of how
   research transitioned from studying students' misconceptions to
   investigating students' understanding and ways of thinking per se. This
   paper has three main goals relative to this contribution. The first goal
   is to offer a conceptual analysis of how students' difficulties surveyed
   in three major literature review publications originate in the
   mathematical meanings and ways of thinking students develop in
   elementary, middle and early high school. The second goal is to
   highlight a contribution to an important aspect that the articles in
   this issue make but was overshadowed by other aspects addressed in
   existing literature reviews: the nature of the mathematics students
   experience under the name ``calculus{''} in various nations or regions
   around the world, and the relation of this mathematics to ways ideas
   foundational to it are developed over the grades. The third goal is to
   outline research questions entailed from these articles for future
   research regarding each of them.},

Abstract = {In Tunisia, calculus is a fundamental component of mathematics
   curriculum in high school and a major requirement at the advanced level
   in the mathematics bachelor's degree and in engineering. Yet, paving the
   way for a passage between high school calculus and university calculus
   remains a challenge for both mathematics education researchers and
   practitioners. In this paper, we address this issue by focusing on
   shared features between high school and university expectations in
   students' learning of calculus, and on the main impediments for high
   school to meet university requirements. We also propose an experimental
   method to help high school teachers to reconsider their actions
   according to insufficiencies in students' preparation for university
   calculus. The results show that it is possible to find a linkage between
   high school and university calculus so as to reduce differences and
   enhance students' transition.},

Abstract = {Problem posing, the process of formulating problems based on a given
   situation, is an essential practice in mathematics and other
   disciplines. Although this is acknowledged in policy documents, problem
   posing is neither substantively nor consistently included in the school
   mathematics curriculum. In this paper, we first comment on the state of
   problem posing in school mathematics and discuss three recommendations
   to improve its integration into curriculum materials and classroom
   practice. These recommendations present a low barrier to entry for
   teachers and students and require only minor changes to common
   mathematics classroom activities and curriculum materials. Based on the
   three recommendations, as well as the features of effective teacher
   professional development, a program was created to investigate
   longitudinally the impact of problem-posing professional development on
   teachers' conceptions of problem posing and their design of lessons to
   teach mathematics using problem posing, as well as on students'
   learning. Initial findings are presented, including the significant
   changes in teachers' conceptions of problem posing and teachers' design
   of lessons to teach mathematics using problem posing, as well as the
   impact on students' learning.},

Abstract = {While recent research demonstrates that teacher noticing is a core
   construct of teaching, it also raises new questions about this
   construct. Here, we offer an expanded framework that addresses three key
   questions. Specifically, we suggest that attending involves not only
   selecting particular features of instruction to observe, but also
   disregarding aspects of classroom interactions that are less
   consequential. In addition, we propose that a stance of inquiry about
   observed phenomena is central to drawing inferences about observed
   phenomena. Finally, we extend the boundaries of teacher noticing to
   include shaping, the act of creating interactions that provide increased
   opportunities to attend to and interpret noteworthy mathematical
   interactions. In other words, teachers are not simply passive bystanders
   in the act of noticing, rather they shape interactions to gain access to
   additional information to allow for further observation and
   interpretation of student thinking.},

Abstract = {The introduction of digital technologies into mathematics classrooms
   requires an adaptation by teachers. To develop an understanding of
   technology integration in classrooms, this research focused on the use
   of dynamic geometry by a mathematics teacher who was a novice in
   technology-use, in the context of Turkish secondary school mathematics.
   Professional instrumental genesis and hiccup constructs were chosen as
   theoretical constructs for the study. Following these constructs, the
   classroom practices of the teacher were analysed to shed light on the
   character of the professional instrumentation and the process through
   which it developed, by highlighting the lesson hiccups. This case study
   analysis illustrated a number of potential problems and ways in which
   the teacher adapted her classroom practices, and provided some
   indications of the growth of teaching schemes in the course of
   appropriating dynamic geometry.},

Abstract = {While race, class, and gender are often treated as well-defined and
   static identities within mathematics education research, we explore
   gender, race and class as performances through the case of a middle
   school Black girl, Cameryn. Scenes from video artifacts are
   deconstructed using a hermeneutic process to reveal how Cameryn
   positions herself as a seemingly disinterested, resistant mathematics
   student through a facade we call blackgirl face. Blackgirl face not only
   reflects the particularities of Black girlhood for Cameryn but provides
   a new conceptual lens for understanding mathematics learning as a
   performance, requiring and enabling children to simultaneously negotiate
   race, class, and gender.},

Abstract = {Identity research in mathematics education has become increasingly
   prominent over the past two decades. In the last few years, there have
   been several reviews of identity literature in the field of mathematics
   education generally, or specifically focused on mathematics learner
   identities or mathematics teacher identity. We begin our paper by
   summarizing the key findings of these reviews, pointing to various
   categorizations proposed by their authors, and the key critiques raised
   therein. We then report on our more recent review of identity literature
   in mathematics education published in the top twenty mathematics
   education journals over the past 5 years (47 articles in total). This
   review enables us firstly to speak descriptively about the extent to
   which the field is evolving (or not) in relation to earlier findings
   (dominant regions, focus of research, methods and perspectives used).
   Secondly, following deeper analysis of the papers, we speak to the way
   in which the field is addressing (or not) key critiques raised by
   reviews. Our analysis points to several theoretical, methodological and
   empirical absences and challenges requiring further engagement. We
   further highlight key absences in the research, particularly a lack of
   cross-national comparative studies and studies that connect learner and
   teacher identities. We then provide a summary discussion and analysis of
   the contributions of the present special issue papers and engage with
   how these take the field forward. Finally, we engage with the
   implications of our analysis and recommendations for future directions
   for research.},

Abstract = {Research has shown that word problem difficulty is influenced by various
   linguistic, numerical and general variables, but results in this area
   are inconsistent. This paper focuses on the question of how the order of
   numerical data, the context, the position of the unknown transformation,
   and the length of the statement in an additive word problem, influence
   the achievement and reasoning of primary pupils. These variables were
   varied in two word problems requiring additive reasoning and these
   variants were solved by pupils in Grades 4 and 5 from four Prague
   primary schools. Item Response Theory was used both for the division of
   the pupils into four equally able groups each solving a different
   variant of the word problem, and for the quantitative interpretation of
   data. The pupils' solutions were also analysed in a qualitative way. For
   a complex additive problem with several states and transformations, we
   noticed a significant influence of the order of data and the position of
   the unknown transformation on the pupils' achievement and types of
   mistakes. No such influence of context (with which the pupils do not
   have immediate experience) or the length of the text (prolonged by
   superfluous information) was found. Some implications for teaching
   mathematics and preparing tests are given.},

Abstract = {Based in part on our work in adapting existing paper textbooks for
   secondary schools for a digital format, this paper discusses paper form
   and the various electronic platforms with regard to the presentation of
   five aspects of mathematics that have roles in mathematics learning in
   all the grades kindergarten-12: symbolization, deduction, modeling,
   algorithms, and representations. In moving to digital platforms, each of
   these aspects of mathematics presents its own challenges and
   opportunities for both curriculum and instruction, that is, for the
   content goals and how they connect with students for learning. A
   combination of paper and electronic presentations may be an optimal
   solution but some difficulties with such a complex solution are
   presented.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a longitudinal mixed methods evaluation study on
   the acquisition and development of mathematical pedagogical content
   knowledge (MPCK) of future teachers at several German universities. The
   study is a German supplementary study to the international comparative
   TEDS-M 2008 study. Besides the pedagogical content knowledge that was
   longitudinally surveyed using instruments relating to TEDS-M 2008, the
   study examined additionally, in qualitatively oriented interviews, what
   individual perceptions the future teachers have of courses on
   mathematics education. In the data nine different systematic perceptions
   could be identified that could be assigned to four different dimensions
   of courses on mathematics education. Through the integration of the
   different results the relationship between knowledge acquisition and
   perceptions is described, as exemplified by the cases of two future
   teachers. Hereby the future teachers' explanations provide an
   interpretive background for the development of their MPCK.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to discuss how university mathematics courses
   can become more relevant for pre-service teachers (PSTs). We therefore
   introduce a concept we call mathematical orientation and develop an
   analytical framework based on Felix Klein's pervasive approach to
   elementary mathematics from a higher standpoint and the work of the
   practical philosopher Stegmaier on orientation. This framework is used
   to analyze the mathematical orientation of PSTs on two mathematics
   courses in Norway and Switzerland. In a qualitative empirical approach,
   we analyzed 85 reflections written by PSTs on the topic of decimal
   expansions and reconstructed aspects of their individual mathematical
   orientation. Our results show that mathematical orientation varies
   across PSTs to a certain extent. In particular, different points of
   reference, perspectives, standpoints, and types of links between the
   mathematical content and teaching situations could be identified. We
   therefore propose that mathematical orientation can be considered a key
   variable in addressing the mathematical needs of PSTs in university
   courses.},

Abstract = {Discrete mathematics brings interesting problems for teaching and
   learning proof, with accessible objects such as integers (arithmetic),
   graphs (modeling, order) or polyominoes (geometry). Many problems that
   are still open can be explained to a large public. The objects can be
   manipulated by simple dynamic operations (removing, adding, `gluing',
   contracting, splitting, decomposing, etc.). All these operations can be
   seen as tools for proving. In this paper we particularly explore the
   field of `discrete optimization'. A theoretical background is defined by
   taking two main axes into account, namely, the epistemological analysis
   of discrete problems studied by contemporary researchers in discrete
   optimization and the design of adidactical situations for classrooms in
   the frame of the Theory of Didactical Situations. Two problems coming
   from ongoing research in discrete optimization (the Pentamino Exclusion
   and the Eight Queens problems) are developed and transposed for the
   classroom. They underscore the learning potentialities of discrete
   mathematics and epistemological obstacles concerning proving processes.
   They emphasize the understanding of a necessary condition and a
   sufficient condition and problematize the difference between optimal and
   optimum. They provide proofs involving partitioning strategies, greedy
   algorithms but also primal-dual methods leading to the concept of
   duality. The way such problems can be implemented in the classroom is
   described in a collaborative study by mathematicians and mathematics
   education researchers (Maths a Modeler Research Federation) through the
   Research Situations for the Classroom project.},

Abstract = {Properties of arithmetic operations are important in mathematics and
   play a significant role in elementary school students' learning of
   mathematics. At the same time, it is quite challenging to help students
   learn arithmetic operational properties beyond memorization, so that
   they know when and how to use a specific arithmetic property. This paper
   reports a study containing two parts to explore students' learning of
   the Commutative Property of Addition (CPA) as related to the content
   presentation in textbooks. Part one is to assess selected students'
   performance on CPA at the end of Grade two, and part two is to explore
   possible contributions of textbooks to students' performance in
   Shanghai. Firstly, we evaluated the performance of 41 second-graders on
   CPA by collecting data through a paper-and-pencil test, which was
   followed up with individual interviews. Through analyzing how textbooks
   present and organize this topic, we sought to better understand from a
   curriculum standpoint how students' performance on CPA is impacted by
   textbooks. Results revealed that Shanghai textbooks make a positive
   contribution to students' learning performance. The findings from this
   study help to shed light on how those textbooks aid student learning,
   and provide an example for further reflection on student learning of
   arithmetic operational properties in different curricula.},

Abstract = {Collaborative learning has been advocated for the last several decades.
   However, classroom practice has indicated that this method often comes
   with challenges and low efficiency, suggesting the need for better
   support for teachers. The aim of this study is to explore teachers'
   learning about collaborative learning in a professional development (PD)
   environment. In particular, we focused on teacher perceptions of the two
   aspects of collaborative learning, namely, tasks and collaboration.
   Teachers learned that tasks for collaborative learning should be
   open-ended, challenging, and feature a low floor but a high ceiling.
   Such tasks call for true collaboration among group members and provide a
   space for interactive engagement. In addition, teachers learned that
   true collaboration should occur in two layers, including both peer
   collaboration and collaboration between the PD provider (researcher) and
   teachers. For peer collaboration, there should be `deep participation'
   in which every group member actively contributes ideas and engages with
   others' thinking. For the researcher-teacher collaboration, the PD
   provider serves as the teachers' learning partner through careful task
   design and facilitation of learning. Based on their direct experience
   with collaborative learning in this PD workshop, teachers learned about
   the roles of tasks and collaboration in their own classrooms.
   Implications of the findings and future directions for research and
   practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Most parents consider private supplementary tutoring (PT) as an
   effective means of improving academic achievement. However, previous
   studies on this method have produced either partial or inconclusive
   results on its effectiveness. Thus, in the present study we conducted a
   comprehensive analysis of the learning of middle school students in
   China, with specific focus on the final year of middle school. The
   analysis was based on a specially designed longitudinal survey of
   private supplementary tutoring in mathematics. An analysis using
   hierarchical linear regression showed that regular private tutoring,
   throughout the school years, could have a minor effect on students'
   mathematical achievements by the final year of middle school. These
   results suggest that parents should make careful choices for their
   children's private tutoring, and the government must issue
   comprehensive, professional guidelines to regulate the private tutoring
   industry. Moreover, other countries could find major take-aways from the
   Chinese experience of private tutoring for enhancing students'
   mathematical performances.},

Abstract = {In this case study, we investigate one teacher's implementation of
   DNR-based combinatorics curriculum in their high school discrete
   mathematics class. By examining the teacher's practices in whole-class
   discussions of two counting problems, we study how they advanced a
   variety of ways of thinking to support the development of a set-oriented
   way of thinking about counting. In particular, we find the teacher
   worked to build shared experience and understanding of mathematical
   ideas by grounding her teaching in students' ways of understanding and
   leveraging students' intellectual needs. In doing so, the teacher
   promoted a set-oriented way of thinking through attending to connections
   between sets of outcomes, counting processes, and formulas in student
   representations and justifications; elevated solutions employing process
   pattern generalization; and advanced the beliefs that counting problems
   can be solved in many ways and entail several types of mathematical
   activity.},

Abstract = {Research has revealed the extent and mechanism of the relation between
   language (dominated by alphabetic systems) and students' mathematics
   learning, but when it comes to Chinese language (an orthographic
   system), nature remains elusive. In this meta-analysis we aim to
   quantify the size of the relation between Chinese language and
   mathematics and determine the mechanism under which the correlation
   works. With a random effect model, a moderate relation (r = 0.36, 95\%CI
   {[}0.34, 0.38]) between Chinese language and mathematics was identified
   in 34 studies with 27 unique samples and 58,995 participants. Both
   dimensions of Chinese language and domains of mathematics were verified
   as significant moderators. Differences and commonalities of the relation
   between (Chinese) language and mathematics were discussed compared with
   existing meta-analyses. The findings suggested that consistent with
   alphabetic languages such as English, Chinese phonological processing,
   especially Rapid Automatic Naming (RAN) had the weakest correlation with
   mathematics, while oral comprehension and comprehensive language
   produced the strongest relations with mathematics; and Chinese language
   had the strongest correlation with comprehensive mathematics. Compared
   with alphabetic languages, Chinese language showed a stronger
   correlation with calculations; Chinese RAN showed a weaker correlation
   with mathematics, while Chinese orthographic-related skills produced a
   superior correlation with mathematics. Research implications were also
   suggested.},

Abstract = {Creativity has been identified as a key characteristic that allows
   students to adapt smoothly to rapid societal and economic changes in the
   real world. However, Chinese students appear to perform less well in
   mathematical problem-solving and problem-posing abilities, which are
   strongly connected to mathematical creativity. Mathematical modelling
   has recently been introduced as one of the six core competencies in the
   Chinese mathematical curriculum and is built on students' ability to
   solve real-world problems using mathematical means. As mathematical
   modelling is characterised by openness regarding the understanding of
   complex real-world problems and the complex relationship between the
   real world and mathematics, for the strengthening of creativity,
   mathematical modelling activities seem to be adequate to accomplish this
   purpose. In this paper, we describe a study with 71 upper secondary
   school students, 50 pre-service mathematics teachers, and 66 in-service
   mathematics teachers, based on an extended didactical framework
   regarding mathematical modelling as a creativity-demanding activity. The
   results of the study indicate a significant correlation between
   modelling competencies and creativity aspects. Especially significant
   correlations between the adequacy of the modelling approaches and the
   two creativity aspects of usefulness and fluency could be identified, as
   well as a significant negative correlation between usefulness and
   originality. The results of the correlational analysis of relationships
   among the four criteria were not always consistent in the three
   participant groups. Overall, the results have implications for the
   promotion of creativity for various expertise groups and demonstrate the
   dependency of the modelling activities on the mathematical knowledge of
   the participants and the mathematical topic with which they are dealing.},

Title = {The Use of Digital Technology to Estimate a Value of Pi: Teachers'
   Solutions on Squaring the Circle in a Graduate Course in Brazil},

Abstract = {In this research we investigate how mathematics teachers, as graduate
   students, estimate the value of pi by exploring the problem of squaring
   the circle using digital technology. Initially, we mention some aspects
   of teaching and learning of calculus in the literature, emphasizing
   studies that use the notion of humans-with-media to highlight the role
   of technology in mathematical thinking and knowledge production.
   Insights on the history of mathematics in calculus are also discussed.
   We developed a qualitative study based on three different solutions
   created by groups of teachers using the software GeoGebra and Microsoft
   Excel. All the teachers' solutions improved the approximation
   (8/9)(2)approximate to pi/4, by determining p and q for
   (p/q)(2)approximate to pi/4. The first two solutions with GeoGebra
   emphasized experimentation and visualization, improving the
   approximation from one to three decimal places. The third solution with
   Excel pointed out the elaboration of a formula and improved it up to six
   decimal places. We emphasize how media shaped the strategies and
   solutions of the groups. Based on these solutions, we explore an
   approach for cubing the sphere, discussing approximations for pi,
   highlighting the role of media in enhancing conceptual complexity in the
   solution of mathematical problems. The nature of the strategies for
   solving a problem is discussed, especially regarding different ways of
   thinking-with-technology developed by collectives of
   teachers-with-media. Although we acknowledge an alternative design for
   the proposed task, the exploration of problems using aspects of the
   history of mathematics contributes to the state of the art concerning
   the studies in calculus developed by the Research Group on Technology,
   other Media, and Mathematics Education in Brazil.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on problem solving and problem posing in mathematics
   education with 6-year-olds. After working on a problem-solving activity,
   the young students were asked to pose asimilartask to a friend. This
   article explores how the students interpret the notion ofsimilar. To be
   able to pose a problem-solving task themselves the students had to
   change perspective, from searching for information to providing
   information, and from searching for a solution to searching for a
   question. Also, to create asimilartask the students had to reflect on
   the original problem-solving task. Thus, their posed tasks shed light on
   their interpretation of what the original problem-solving task was
   really about. The results show that the large majority of the students
   included some three-dimensional aspects from the original
   problem-solving task in their posed tasks. However, the questions they
   posed varied in terms of whether or not they included mathematical
   elements.},

Abstract = {Educators often argue that students should engage in activities such as
   conjecturing, proving, and deductive reasoning. The underlying principle
   is that learning mathematics means doing as mathematicians do. However,
   ``mathematician{''} implicitly refers to a pure mathematician at
   university.The aim of our paper is to critically question the logic
   model underpinning these premises in order to suggest which aspects of
   mathematicians' practice could be salutary for students in schools and
   university and which are not. We argue that aligning learning with these
   practices might not meet the broader educational goals of pragmatism and
   vocationalism. We show that activities attributed to pure mathematicians
   are largely ignored by biologists, engineers, and physicists and in
   workplace settings. In contrast the practices of professional modellers
   are highly valued. We argue that such practices are desirable for
   learning to use and apply mathematics. Next, we illustrate the
   suitability of practices from studies of professional modellers and
   applied mathematicians for classroom learning using empirical data. We
   conclude that the interpretation of mathematicians' practice to be
   emulated must be broadened to include professional modellers' practices
   to better serve meeting educational goals for more students.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the relationship between knowledge and
   instructional quality of novice primary school teachers during their
   first 3 years of teaching mathematics. This study utilizes the Classroom
   video analysis and the Mathematical quality of instruction to examine
   changes in beginning teachers' usable knowledge and instructional
   quality, respectively, and their relationship in each year. The analyses
   reveal positive associations between knowledge and instructional quality
   in the second and third year of teaching. Two case study teachers
   illustrate the tight link between knowledge and practice and how
   different school contexts provide contrasting opportunities to learn
   from practice, thus contributing to the different patterns of knowledge
   and instructional quality over time. The findings suggest that usable
   knowledge of student mathematical thinking at the beginning of the
   profession supports teacher improvement in both knowledge and practice
   over time if the vision of the school context is aligned with
   student-centered instruction.},

Title = {Numeracy and migrant students: a case study of secondary level
   mathematics education in Norway},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that adults from migrant backgrounds often
   have lower numeracy competence than do their majority counterparts, even
   though many were educated in their host country. Leaving secondary
   education with lower levels of numeracy competence than majority
   students potentially makes migrant students vulnerable as adults, as the
   lack of numeracy competence can negatively impact their opportunities to
   participate in work-life and society, in addition to affecting their
   everyday lives. Thus, it is vitally important to understand how
   mathematics education at the compulsory level can offer migrant students
   opportunities to develop numeracy competence. This paper presents a case
   study of four Norwegian lower secondary mathematics teachers. These
   teachers were asked to reflect on their classroom practices and on how
   they adapt teaching and assessment situations to migrant students. Our
   findings show that the teachers valued diversity in their classrooms and
   that their teaching was student-centred, focused on assessment for
   learning and problem-solving practices. These are potential building
   blocks for culturally responsive teaching. However, the teachers mainly
   focused on language issues, while cultural aspects of classroom
   participation and mathematical activity were neglected. This paper
   argues that such views may potentially hinder the provision of equal
   opportunities for all students to become numerate and, therefore, may
   contribute to maintaining migrant students-and the migrant adults they
   will become-as a vulnerable group.},

Abstract = {This paper responds to the frequently occurring phenomena of `sad
   affects' experienced by student teachers as they confront the logic of
   `proper mathematics' with young children of differently abled bodies.
   The notion of `proper' entails a normalizing fixity of `what counts' as
   mathematics for certain children and fails to recognize mathematics as a
   sensual encounter amongst bodies. The study draws upon Spinoza's notion
   of affect to consider the body's capacity to act, and makes the case for
   choreographing with body-movement, rather than disclosing, the politics
   involved in becoming teachers. It discusses how affective bodying with
   mathematics, children and difference in the classroom practice can be
   not only deconstructed but also reconstructed in affirmative terms,
   choreographically, as feeling and thinking-in-movement in ways that
   trouble and perturb the prevailing sharing of the `sensible' in early
   childhood mathematics and in teacher education.},

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the outcomes of a design experiment that sought
   to improve the multiplicative reasoning of 12-13year-old learners across
   two schools in a South African context of low performance. Using a
   hybrid theoretical base in Realistic Mathematics Education, variation
   theory and analogical reasoning, a short-term intervention consisting of
   four lessons, designed with attunement to classroom culture and levels
   of learning, was implemented. Outcomes based on pre- and post-testing
   pointed to substantial gains in both schools, leading to interest in
   understanding the nature and extent of changes in models and calculation
   approaches in high performance and high gain item clusters. Increases in
   appropriate setting up of symbolic models of multiplicative situations
   and in more efficient calculation are discussed.},

Abstract = {Elements of statistical modeling can be implemented already in primary
   school. A prerequisite for this approach is that teachers are
   well-educated in this domain. Content knowledge, pedagogical content
   knowledge and (pedagogical) content related technological knowledge are
   core components of teacher education. We designed a course for
   elementary preservice teachers with regard to developing statistical
   thinking including the mentioned knowledge facets. The course includes
   exploring data and modeling and simulating chance experiments with
   TinkerPlots. We use the data factory metaphor' in fictive contexts and
   in contexts stemming from civic statistics for supporting the idea of
   modeling. We interviewed four participants of the course to assess and
   analyze their reasoning. We analyze how they model a given civic
   statistics contextual problem using the TinkerPlots sampler and how they
   evaluate their model with regard to a civic statistics context (the
   situation of hospitals in Germany).},

Title = {Computer-based assessment of mathematics into the twenty-first century:
   pressures and tensions},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {In recent decades, technology has influenced various aspects of
   assessment in mathematics education: (1) supporting the assessment of
   higher-order thinking skills in mathematics, (2) representing authentic
   problems from the world around us to use and apply mathematical
   knowledge and skills, and (3) making the delivery of tests and the
   analysis of results through psychometric analysis more sophisticated. We
   argue that these developments are not pushing mathematics education in
   the same direction, however, which creates tensions. Mathematics
   education-so essential for educating young people to be creative and
   problem solving agents in the twenty-first century-is at risk of
   focusing too much on assessment of lower order goals, such as the
   reproduction of procedural, calculation based, knowledge and skills.
   While there is an availability of an increasing amount of sophisticated
   technology, the related advances in measurement, creation and delivery
   of automated assessments of mathematics are however being based on
   sequences of atomised test items. In this article several aspects of the
   use of technology in the assessment of mathematics education are
   exemplified and discussed, including in relation to the aforementioned
   tension. A way forward is suggested by the introduction of a framework
   for the categorisation of mathematical problem situations with an
   increasing sophistication of representing the problem situation using
   various aspects of technology. The framework could be used to reflect on
   and discuss mathematical assessment tasks, especially in relation to
   twenty-first century skills.},

Abstract = {This article describes a sequence of design research projects, some
   exploratory others more formal, on the teaching of modelling and the
   analysis of modelling skills. The initial motivation was the author's
   observation that the teaching of applied mathematics in UK high schools
   and universities involved no active modelling by students, but was
   entirely focused on their learning standards models of a restricted
   range of phenomena, largely from Newtonian mechanics. This did not
   develop the numeracy/mathematical literacy that was so clearly important
   for future citizens. Early explorations started with modelling workshops
   with high school teachers and mathematics undergraduates, observed and
   analysed-in some case using video. The theoretical basis of this work
   has been essentially heuristic, though the Shell Centre studies
   included, for example, a detailed analysis of formulation processes that
   has not, as so often, been directly replicated. Recent work has focused
   on developing a formative assessment approach to teaching modelling that
   has proved both successful and popular. Finally, the system-level
   challenges in trying to establish modelling as an integral part of
   mathematics curricula are briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {Stimulating thinking related to mathematical content is the focus of
   many tasks in the mathematics classroom. Beyond such content-related
   thinking, promoting forms of higher order thinking is among the goals of
   mathematics instruction as well. So-called hybrid tasks focus on
   combining both goals: they aim at fostering mathematical thinking and
   higher order thinking through the same mathematical activities-an aim
   which requires empirical examination. For empirically valid hybrid task
   design, evidence is required about the nature of the interrelatedness of
   content-related and higher order thinking. In this article, we choose
   the example of statistical thinking and critical thinking for exploring
   the interrelatedness of these different modes of thinking when solving
   hybrid tasks. Even if theories about statistical thinking and critical
   thinking have so far followed almost separate strands, there are
   commonalities at the theoretical level, which facilitate hybrid task
   design. We report an empirical study, in which a bottom-up analysis of
   thinking-aloud interviews with adult learners around solution processes
   of hybrid tasks affords insight into how these modes of thinking may
   interact when solving such tasks. The results show that the tasks did
   evoke both statistical thinking and critical thinking: Both modes of
   thinking entered in an interplay in which we observed instances of
   mutual support of both modes of thinking, but also cases in which a
   strong focus on statistical thinking or critical thinking appeared to
   impede the other mode of thinking, respectively. The findings can inform
   the further development of hybrid tasks: Based on the observations, the
   task format can be enriched with specific reflective stimuli intended to
   support a fruitful interplay of statistical thinking and critical
   thinking.},

Title = {Using refutational text in mathematics education},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {509-518},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Refutational text is one of the many instructional techniques that have
   been proposed to be used in education as a way to achieve effective
   learning. The aim of refutational text is to transform misconceptions
   into conceptions that are in line with current scientific concepts. This
   is done by explicitly stating a misconception, refuting it, and
   providing a correct conception. It has been applied in various
   curricular domains, and seems to be effective in inducing cognitive
   conflicts in learners and remediating misconceptions. In this article we
   first discuss the design principles and the theoretical underpinnings of
   refutational text. Then we briefly review the existing empirical
   research, both in general and specifically within the domain of
   mathematics education. Next, we zoom in on a series of studies we
   conducted in which refutational text was used to improve the
   interpretation of box plots. In these studies we focused on one very
   persistent misinterpretation of box plots, the area misinterpretation,
   which we tried to remediate using refutational text. We found that
   students who were exposed to refutational text scored significantly
   better on a box plot interpretation test than students being exposed to
   an instructional text in which no misconceptions were explicitly
   mentioned or refuted. We end with a discussion of theoretical and
   methodological issues for future research and propose recommendations
   for mathematics educators.},

   young prisoners and prospective teachers},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 26},
Abstract = {Mathematics teaching usually occurs in a ``public space{''}-e.g., a
   classroom is a public space with rules defining student and teacher
   roles that cultivate hierarchic relationships. Working in prison with
   young inmates (18-23 years old) from marginalized populations, we
   promoted alternative ``common spaces{''} (physical and symbolic)
   challenging established hierarchies through equal contribution. Such
   mathematics curriculum employs an antideficit model (Louie et al., ZDM
   Mathematics Education 53(1):95-107, 2021) as prisoners co-research their
   lives with mathematics. Common spaces empower through recognition while
   enabling identity transformation. Qualitative data from the CoSpIRom
   {[}Common Spaces for Integration of Roma Project
   (http://cospirom.sed.uth.gr).] project explores: (a) whether common
   spaces, recognition and equal participation can support mathematics
   literacy while empowering and emancipating young prisoners; and (b) if
   and how this framework might prepare prospective teachers within
   contemporary diversity. Bringing together young prisoners and
   prospective teachers affects both populations. Mathematics curriculum
   developed through collaboration meets a consistent request from
   prisoners that educational programs bridge with the outside world as
   re-entry preparation. Contrasting life stories from prospective teachers
   operate as alternative models motivating prisoners to rethink their own
   life stories and self-concepts. Prospective teachers demonstrated
   significant intercultural communication skill development, empathy and
   solidarity for marginalized people, reporting important professional
   identity growth.},

Abstract = {This paper provides on-the-ground accounts of epistemic violence against
   Black immigrant children in mathematics classrooms. From a critical
   feminist perspective, we introduce Dotson's notion of silencing as an
   enactment of epistemic violence. According to Dotson, one way to enact
   epistemic violence is to damage a particular group's ability to speak
   and be heard. A successful act of communication depends on the
   audience's willingness and ability to ``hear{''} the speaker. Therefore,
   denying this reciprocity in communication is a form of epistemic
   violence. Using this conceptualization, we conducted a secondary data
   analysis from a larger study aimed at enhancing teachers' knowledge and
   abilities to implement problem-solving teaching. We identify and
   characterize three practices of silencing Black immigrant students in
   Chilean mathematics classrooms that damage their agency as knowers and
   doers of mathematics. Beyond language issues, we show that silencing is
   a form of anti-Black onto-epistemic violence that prevents Black
   immigrant students from being recognized as legitimate subjects of
   knowledge in mathematics classrooms.},

Abstract = {Describing mathematics classroom teaching and learning is part of a
   professional expertise. Comparing `our distinct stories' and `our
   professional languages' about teaching and learning in mathematics
   classes around the world, reveals cultural and linguistic underpinnings
   of our `stories' and `languages'. Analysing and understanding these
   `stories' and `languages' in the form of narratives of classroom
   lessons, is a methodological approach that allows us to study and
   compare language as a resource across different cultural and linguistic
   contexts. We based our approach on results of the Lexicon Project, which
   set out to document the terms and the professional vocabulary that
   teachers use for describing the phenomena of middle school mathematics
   classrooms around the world, but enlarged this approach by narratives
   and a narrative methodology. Our cultural comparative approach based on
   these narratives revealed not only technical terms that define and make
   explicit didactical intentions, techniques and approaches, but also
   offered narrative descriptions of the enactment of the didactic
   intentions and techniques in situ. This approach provides a deeper
   understanding of the potential of language and turned out to be valuable
   for understanding how language orients teachers' visions and analyses of
   mathematics classrooms.},

Abstract = {Our current multicultural societies require that education addresses
   diversity and promotes cultural awareness and intercultural learning.
   Mathematics and science education can also contribute to this aspect of
   citizenship education and create a culture of belonging for all
   students. Professional development that integrates intercultural
   learning with educational practices is still uncommon in the field of
   science and mathematics teacher preparation and support. This study
   explores the possibilities to support science and mathematics teachers
   in implementing intercultural learning through a professional
   development course. The course was developed in a European setting,
   based on a theoretical analysis, and tried out with 319 teachers from
   six participating countries. The impact of the course on teachers' take
   up of intercultural learning was measured with a pre-post questionnaire.
   We found that the course strengthened teachers' self-efficacy beliefs
   and extended their teaching practices with opportunities created by
   cultural diversity among their students or in their subjects. In
   addition to that, teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and the perceived
   cultural diversity in class appeared to be influencing factors for
   teachers' practices. Based on our findings we recommend that the
   combination of intercultural learning with educational practices of
   mathematics and science might be a suitable gateway to provide new
   intercultural learning opportunities for students.},

Abstract = {Early algebraic thinking is the reasoning engaged in by 5- to
   12-year-olds as they build meaning for the objects and ways of thinking
   to be encountered within the later study of secondary school algebra.
   Ever since the 1990s when interest in developing algebraic thinking in
   the earlier grades began to emerge, there has been a steady growth in
   the research devoted to exploring ways of fostering this thinking. While
   in its early days this research had to grapple with the question of what
   kinds of algebraic thinking might be feasible for the younger student,
   the evolution of the field over the past 30 years has led to an
   ever-increasing range of activity that is truly multi-dimensional. In
   this survey paper, I have framed the multi-dimensionality of early
   algebraic thinking according to three overarching types, namely, that of
   analytic thinking, structural thinking, and functional thinking, with
   generalizing being the scarlet thread that runs through all three. The
   first part of the paper looks back to the history of the notion of early
   algebra and the initial research efforts aimed at characterizing early
   algebraic thinking. The second part delineates the three overarching
   theoretical dimensions of early algebraic thinking, presents a sampling
   of past empirical findings, and points to some of the more recent work
   in the field, including the contributions to this Special Issue. The
   paper concludes by highlighting the new directions of this domain of
   research and offering suggestions for further research.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the issues involved in creating appropriate
   problems for a popular mathematics competition, and how such problems
   differ from problems typically encountered in a classroom. We discuss
   the differences and similarities in school curricula versus the
   generally agreed upon topics encountered in international competitions.
   The question of inspiration for the development of competition problems
   is dealt with from the standpoint of the problem author, while aspects
   related to the motivation of the contest participant, objective and
   subjective problem difficulty and mathematical precision in mathematics
   competitions are also discussed.},

Abstract = {In 2005, the Brazilian Public Schools Math Olympics (OBMEP) was created
   by the Instituto de Matematica Pura e Aplicada. Since then, around 18
   million students from the sixth to the twelfth grades have taken part in
   the competition annually. In each year of the competition, 6500 medals
   are distributed to public school students. In the following year these
   students receive a scholarship to participate in a training program
   disseminated in 225 centers across the country. Perceiving that the
   greatest impact of OBMEP has occurred in schools engaged with the
   Olympics, in either the preparation of their students for the
   competition or the promotion of award ceremonies for students classified
   as eligible for the second stage, in 2014 OBMEP launched a teacher
   training program. This article reviews the various OBMEP programs, their
   objectives and their impacts, and analyzes the obstacles faced. It also
   discusses the gender gap observed in the Math Olympics. In Brazil, the
   STEM areas of study, namely the sciences, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics, attract fewer girls than boys. A similar phenomenon can be
   observed at the OBMEP. The performance of girls is inferior to that of
   boys. This distinction is accentuated with the age of the students and
   in the grades of students in the upper percentiles of the exam.},

Abstract = {In this study we aimed to understand teaching mathematics through
   problem posing based on an analysis of 22 teaching cases. Teaching
   mathematics through problem posing starts with problem-posing tasks.
   This study provides not only specific examples of problem-posing tasks
   used in classrooms but also related task variables to consider when
   developing problem-posing tasks. This study also contributes to our
   understanding of how teachers can deal with student-posed problems in
   the classroom. In these 22 teaching cases, there was a typical pattern
   to how teachers dealt with the students' posed problems in the classroom
   according to the instructional goals. For future research, we need to
   accumulate additional teaching cases and explore possible discourse
   patterns concerning how teachers handle students' posed problems, as
   well as identify the most effective discourse patterns when teaching
   mathematics through problem posing.},

Abstract = {Emerging multilingual students can develop the dimensions of Academic
   Literacy in Mathematics (ALM) in classroom discussions. But, there is a
   need for empirically-validated principles for fostering such
   discussions. This research used ALM as a framework to create a unit of
   instruction on linear rates of change for ninth grade mathematics in
   which multilingual students benefit from discussions. Project-specific
   design principles are presented along with qualitative analysis of
   classroom discussions from each phase of the project. The results
   illustrate how discussions in the redesigned lessons contributed to
   developing the interrelated dimensions of ALM among multilingual
   learners. The work concludes with a discussion of how the
   project-specific design principles can serve as a framework for
   fostering discussions in other multilingual secondary mathematics
   learning environments.},

Abstract = {While the number of studies of flipped classrooms has increased, they
   have primarily addressed the efficacy of using such an approach on
   student outcomes, often failing to account for the classroom activities
   and learning theories used to design the curriculum. This study begins
   to fill this gap in the literature by uniting the at-home video and
   in-class curricular components of the flipped classroom via design
   heuristics that empower students to critically think about mathematical
   problems individually before engaging with the task in a collective
   environment. To that end, we illustrate how elements of the
   instructional design theory of Realistic Mathematics Education and
   Culturally Responsive Pedagogy influenced the written and hidden
   curriculum and how those considerations were then experienced by the
   students as part of the enacted components of the curriculum. The
   context of the study is a 2-week classroom teaching experiment covering
   topics in trigonometry and vectors for 27 calculus students at a
   Norwegian university.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses two examples of MOOCs aimed at developing
   mathematics teachers' professional learning. The programme, namedMath
   MOOC UniTO, was developed under the guidance of the three authors, in
   collaboration with some researcher-teachers from the University of
   Turin. This paper analyses the development of teachers' learning while
   attending the virtual environment of a MOOC, where all resources are
   available online and where peer interactions take place in asynchronous
   mode thanks to specific communication message boards. To analyse the
   data, two theoretical lenses were considered, namely, Meta-Didactical
   Transposition and Connectivism. The first lens allowed us to describe
   teachers' improvements at macro-level (praxeologies) and micro-level
   (agents); the second lens made possible the utmost consideration of the
   network of knowledge (learning is interpreted in the light of how nodes
   and connections within the network are determined dynamically). Using
   these theoretical lenses, we observed two different teachers' learning
   processes, namely, one that evolved dramatically because of the
   interventions (we call it an explosion), the other less proactively (we
   call it linear). We discuss them, presenting two different emblematic
   examples of data.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies such as multi-representational tools have the
   potential to enhance the learning of mathematics. In light of this
   potential, there is a ubiquitous call to integrate such tools into
   mathematics teaching. However, these technologies are still underused.
   Teaching with technology is not an easy task and teacher competencies
   such as knowledge and beliefs are a decisive factor. Therefore,
   professional development is important to professionalize teachers and
   support them in using technology in meaningful ways. Despite this need,
   little is known about the efficacy of professional development programs
   for teaching mathematics with technology. This quantitative study
   investigated the efficacy of a half-year professional development
   program for teaching mathematics with technology, using the methodology
   of a quasi-experimental design, in Germany. We captured (i) teachers'
   beliefs about teaching with technology, (ii) self-efficacy beliefs
   related to teaching with technology, (iii) epistemological beliefs and
   (iv) self-reported frequency of technology uptake with quantitative
   questionnaires in pre- and post-tests. The experimental group (n = 39)
   participating in the professional development program consisted of
   mostly novices in using technology for teaching mathematics. Propensity
   score matching was used to match this group with a control group of
   teachers (n = 38) who did not participate in the professional
   development program. The strongest impact of the professional
   development program was found on teacher's technology-related beliefs.
   Frequency of technology use seemed to increase gradually in the
   experimental group during the professional development program. No
   effect of the professional development program was found on
   self-efficacy beliefs and epistemological beliefs. We conclude by
   deriving recommendations for designing professional development programs
   related to teaching with technology.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the second phase of a larger research program with
   the purpose of exploring the possible consequences of a gap between what
   is done in the classroom regarding mathematical word problem solving and
   what research shows to be effective in this particular field of study.
   Data from the first phase of our study on teachers' self-proclaimed
   practices showed that one-third of elementary teachers from the region
   of Quebec require their students to follow a specific sequential
   problem-solving method, known as the `what I know, what I look for'
   method. These results led us to hypothesize that the observed gap may
   have an impact on students' comprehension of mathematical word problems.
   The use of this particular method was the foundation for us to study, in
   the second phase, the effect of the imposition of this sequential method
   on students' literal and inferential understanding of word problems. A
   total of 278 fourth graders (9-10 years old) solved mathematical word
   problems followed by a test to assess their understanding of the word
   problems they had just solved. The results suggest that the use of this
   problem solving method does not seem to improve or impair students'
   understanding. From a more fundamental point of view, our study led us
   to the conclusion that the way word problem solving is addressed in the
   mathematics classroom, through sequential and inflexible methods, does
   not help students develop their word problem solving competence.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate how pictorial representations
   with different semiotic characteristics affect additive word problem
   solving by kindergartners. The focus of the study is on three categories
   of additive problems (change problems, combine problems and equalize
   problems) and on representational pictures with different semiotic
   characteristics: (a) pictures in which the problem quantities are
   represented in pictorial form, that is, as groups of illustrated objects
   (PP pictures), (b) pictures in which the quantities are represented
   partly in pictorial form and in symbolic form (PS pictures), and (c)
   pictures in which the quantities are represented in symbolic form (SS
   pictures). Data were collected from 63 kindergartners using a
   paper-and-pencil test. Results showed that the semiotic characteristics
   of representational pictures had a strong and significant effect on
   performance. Children's performance was higher in the problems with PP
   pictures but declined in the problems with PS and SS pictures. However,
   the differences in children's performance across the problems with
   different representational format varied between the problem categories
   and their mathematical structures. The semiotic characteristics of
   representational pictures had an important role in the establishment of
   close relations between children's solutions in problems in different
   categories. Detailed analysis of children's answers to the problems
   revealed a number of picture-related difficulties. Findings are
   discussed and directions for future research are drawn considering the
   methodological limitations of the study.},

Abstract = {In a dynamic geometry environment (DGE) conjectures can be generated by
   manipulating figures with different dragging strategies. One strategy
   (maintaining dragging) that has been the focus of various studies,
   consists of inducing a specific geometric property and trying to
   maintain it. In this paper I focus on abduction and evidence within such
   processes of the generation of conjectures. I discuss the particular
   nature of the abductive process associated with the use of maintaining
   dragging (instrumented abduction). In respect of other forms of
   abduction reported in the literature, I highlight their key role in
   bridging phenomenological evidence and theoretical evidence. Results
   from analysis of a case study suggest that using maintaining dragging
   leads students to the generation of conjectures with solid
   phenomenological evidence. On the other hand, the process withholds a
   potential fragility with respect to proof of the conjectures generated,
   due to the scarce theoretical evidence stemming from it.},

Abstract = {Metacognition is a powerful predictor for learning performance, and for
   problem-solving. But how metacognition works for cognitive strategies
   and learning performance is not clear. The present study was designed to
   explore how metacognition affected the cognition (learning strategies
   and problem solving strategies) and different kinds of learning
   performance involving the development of metacognition for adolescents.
   In a first study, we explored the structure of metacognition by
   examining multiple theoretical frameworks and the psychometric
   characteristics of metacognition. The Bifactor model confirmed the two
   processes modeling of domain-general versus domain-specific monitoring
   for different tasks in reading and mathematics. In a second study, a
   path model was used to explore the effect of metacognition on learning
   strategies, problem-solving strategies, and performance of reading and
   mathematics. The relationships in the model were tested controlling
   gender and age. Results showed that problem-solving was the only
   mediator between general metacognition and learning performance. It is
   suggested that the subcomponents of metacognition be involved in future
   studies.},

Abstract = {This is an analysis of the author's involvement since 1970 in textbook
   development for primary schools and adult education in Mozambique,
   focusing on integrating local cultural traditions, covering the period
   up to 2013. As main example, addition of the type 8 + 5 = 13 is used
   around the question of whether textbooks (and curricula) advocate
   counting strategies and/or computation strategies. Different
   visualisations of these strategies in textbooks and corresponding
   manipulatives are analysed. During the 1990s, local languages started to
   be used in adult education, apart from Portuguese, Mozambique's official
   language. Unschooled adults showed the importance of verbal computation
   in Mozambican languages-Bantu languages-most of which use also the
   auxiliary base five, apart from the base-ten numerals. The 2003
   curriculum for primary education introduced the possibility of using
   local languages, and NGO's started translating textbooks into 16
   Mozambican languages. The paper includes an analysis of some of these
   textbooks and concludes with the author's ideas in his teacher's guides
   on teaching mathematics in Mozambican languages, showing the
   opportunities of verbal computation, exploring base-five numerals
   supported by finger gestures, instead of finger counting.},

Abstract = {The problem of adverse effects of prior knowledge in mathematics
   learning has been amply documented and theorized by mathematics
   educators as well as cognitive/developmental psychologists. This problem
   emerges when students' prior knowledge about a mathematical notion comes
   in contrast with new information coming from instruction, giving rise to
   systematic errors. Conceptual change perspectives on mathematics
   learning suggest that in such cases reorganization of students' prior
   knowledge is necessary. Analogical reasoning, in particular cross-domain
   mapping, is considered an important mechanism for conceptual
   restructuring. However, the use of analogies in instruction is often
   found ineffective, mainly because the structural similarity between two
   domains is obscure for students. To deal with this problem, John Clement
   and his colleagues developed the bridging strategy that uses multiple
   analogies to bring students to pay attention to the structural
   similarity that often goes unnoticed. This paper focuses on the
   cross-domain mapping between number and the (geometrical) line that has
   been instrumental in the development of the number concept. I summarize
   findings of a series of studies that investigated students'
   understandings of density in arithmetical and geometrical contexts from
   a conceptual change perspective; and I discuss how this research-based
   evidence was used to design an intervention study that used the analogy
   ``numbers are points on the number line{''}, and a bridging analogy
   ({''}the number line is like an imaginary rubber band that never breaks,
   no matter how much it is stressed{''}) with the aim of bringing the
   notion of density within the grasp of secondary students.},

Abstract = {This special issue comprises contributions that address the breadth of
   current lines of recent research from cognitive psychology that appear
   promising for positively impacting students' learning of mathematics.
   More specifically, we included contributions (a) that refer to cognitive
   psychology based principles and techniques, such as explanatory
   questioning, worked examples, metacognitive training, exemplification,
   refutational texts, multiple external representations, which are
   considered as well-established principles or techniques for
   instructional design in general, and (b) that explore, illustrate and
   critically discuss the available research evidence for their relevance
   and efficacy in the specific curricular domain of mathematics teaching
   and learning. The special issue ends with an interview with Paul
   Kirchner about the relationships between cognitive psychology,
   instructional design and mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Micro-teaching at universities and student teaching in secondary schools
   are standard forms of practice training for pre-service mathematics
   teachers in Chinese university teacher education programs. The former is
   guided by university professors, and the latter is guided by school
   teachers. In recent years, a special kind of microteaching practice held
   at university and guided by expert secondary mathematics teachers was
   organized to link the regular micro-teaching and student teaching. The
   purpose of this study is to investigate one aspect of the impact of
   micro-teaching guided by expert secondary mathematics teachers on
   pre-service teachers' teaching practice: learning to attend to
   precision. Four normal university students majoring in mathematics were
   selected and observed when they were teaching: before, during, and after
   the activity. Each lesson was videotaped, transcribed, and then analyzed
   using qualitative data analysis methods. The reflections from the
   participants were also collected and analyzed. The results indicate that
   micro-teaching guided by expert secondary mathematics teachers can help
   pre-service teachers attend to precision in their classroom teaching,
   but some lack of precision in performance was still observed in the
   pre-service teachers' lessons. The guidance and the exemplary lessons of
   expert teachers played an important role in changing the pre-service
   teachers' performance. The findings have the potential to be useful for
   mathematics teacher preparation and professional development programs.
   It could possibly also contribute to other research areas in mathematics
   classroom teaching.},

Abstract = {Problems for students with a high mathematical potential can be far more
   complex and challenging than problems normally used in regular
   classrooms. The problems we developed for mathematically gifted students
   offer the possibility of acquiring and using heuristics (so called
   patterns of actions) which are useful in problem solving processes.
   Because these kinds of capablities are valuable for all students, we ask
   whether it is possible to work on the problems in regular classrooms. In
   this paper two studies are presented, which examine to what extent
   students in regular classrooms are capable of working on problems
   designed for mathematically gifted students. The results show that the
   problems used in the support programme can also be successfully applied
   in regular classroom teaching and that students working on them
   experience high motivation. However, students of our support programme
   achieved better results regarding generalization and proving. In
   addition, they needed less time to solve the problems.},

Title = {Moving beyond reflection and toward disruption in the post-field context
   of mathematics teacher education},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 11},
Abstract = {Prospective teachers bring countless stories of success and failure from
   different mathematics classrooms to their post-field teacher education
   courses. These reflective stories often glorify school mathematics
   classrooms and dominant traditions within, instead of confronting the
   marginalization of diverse groups in school environments. Mathematics
   teacher educators have a significant role to play in teaching
   prospective teachers to reflect critically on their field experiences
   and, in doing so, create spaces for disruption and disruptive
   pedagogies. Drawing on critical and equity-based theories applied within
   the fields of mathematics education and teacher education research, we
   propose a disruptive pedagogy analytical framework that enables us to
   study the roles and practices of mathematics teacher educators as they
   conduct their work in these post-field contexts of teacher education. In
   this paper, we introduce our disruptive pedagogy framework and present
   the results that followed from using it to analyze data from a research
   study in which mathematics teacher educators from across Canada and
   Norway were interviewed. We claim that our analytical framework can be
   used to identify those disruptive and transformative practices initiated
   by mathematics teacher educators-practices that are necessary to bring
   about shifts in inequitable and unjust classroom practices of school
   mathematics and in becoming a teacher. Unfortunately, however, results
   reported here point to the need for further shifts and growth toward
   more explicitly disruptive practices initiated by mathematics teacher
   educators in the post-field context.},

Abstract = {Citizenship education is historically linked with political developments
   that have forced governments to think deeper about nationality, power,
   identity, and the process of decolonization since large sectors of the
   population are denied and even excluded from the development of their
   citizenship. Currently, there is a need to provide mechanisms that
   foster the development of students' citizenship by enabling them to
   position themselves critically, politically, responsibly, and
   constructively in their own sociocultural contexts. These mechanisms
   contribute towards offering the intellectual tools needed to participate
   in society and also can encourage educators to develop pedagogical
   actions that stimulate students to develop their citizenship and be
   aware of problems they face in their communities. Thus, results of a
   study conducted in a public middle school, located in the metropolitan
   region of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, with 12 eighth-grade middle school
   students enrolled in a state public school, who are residents in a
   peripheral community, showed how ethnomodelling contributed to the
   development of mathematical content, which helped them to understand and
   propose solutions to the lack of basic sanitation. We concluded that
   competencies to analyze, decide, and judge solutions through the
   elaboration of ethnomodels helped students to make decisions to local
   and global problems, which promoted the development of their citizenship
   as well as the acknowledgment that the denial and exclusion process of
   peripheral communities' members still prevails in modern society.},

Abstract = {Many international studies focus empirically on integrating the history
   of mathematics in mathematics education. Over the last 2 decades, some
   studies also revealed theoretical elements concerning the implementation
   of learning sessions and/or their didactical analysis and effectiveness.
   This paper has the aim of complementing these empirical studies with a
   more systematic approach in the French context. Defended for decades
   within the IREM (Institut de recherche sur l'enseignement des
   mathematiques), the history of mathematics is now officially introduced
   in the French curriculum. Nevertheless, is it really sufficient for
   teachers to change their habits by implementing the history of
   mathematics in their practices? To answer this question, I first present
   an unpublished survey with secondary school mathematics teachers (pupils
   from 10- to 18 years old) about the introduction of the history of
   mathematics in their classes. This survey allows the comparison of
   teachers' desires ('history of mathematics in potentiality') and
   realities in classrooms ('history of mathematics in actuality'). Then I
   focus on French mathematics textbooks (for pupils from 15- to 18 years
   old) in order to question their effectiveness as tools for the
   introduction of a historical perspective. I describe the
   historical/mathematical tasks available in these textbooks focusing on
   their reference to Fibonacci. Finally, I present a proposition to
   implement the history of mathematics in mathematics education starting
   from the textbooks, aiming to help mathematics teachers to redesign the
   tasks of their textbooks so as to be more relevant.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a small-scale, comparative study on
   the perceived impact that having students enter Mathematics competitions
   has on Mathematics teachers in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and the UK and
   on their classroom practice. The study surveyed a small number of
   Mathematics teachers in the three countries who teach in both public and
   private schools and in both rural and urban regions. The perceived
   advantages and disadvantages to students from taking part in
   competitions and to teachers who have students taking part in
   competitions are discussed and the findings compared across the three
   countries. The effect that Mathematics competitions have on the
   identification and development of the mathematical talent of students is
   considered together with the contribution of these activities to the
   academic environment of the classroom. For the teachers who did have
   students taking Mathematics competitions, the limitations of entry and
   the different methods in which teachers prepare or assist students to
   prepare for the competitions are compared between countries. Since the
   study is small in scale, no firm conclusions are drawn but suggestions
   are made as to where future, larger scale, studies might be carried out
   to see if the classroom experiences of all could be positively
   influenced by exposure to Mathematics competitions.},

Abstract = {In this survey paper we focus on mathematics learning in Chinese
   contexts, as a way to contribute to broader discussions about
   mathematical learning. We first review the features of Chinese students'
   mathematical learning depicted in the literature, followed by a review
   of student mathematical learning in recent Chinese research journals.
   This leads to an introduction of the papers on Chinese students'
   learning in this issue. For Chinese students' learning contexts, we
   discuss four aspects, namely, classroom instruction, teachers'
   professional learning, curriculum materials, and learning outside of
   school. For each context, we review the literature findings on the
   identified features, introduce emerged practices and most recent
   policies under the reformed era, and discuss the relevant papers in this
   special issue. Whenever possible, we connect findings on Chinese
   students' learning with the associated contexts and relate these
   findings in the Chinese contexts to findings in the broader world
   context. We conclude this survey paper with possible lessons learned
   from Chinese students' learning features and from the varied Chinese
   contexts. In particular, we discuss these aspects from culturally
   contextualized and semantically decontextualized dimensions, which is
   expected to facilitate broad international discourse centering on the
   three questions proposed at the end of this paper.},

Abstract = {A significant distinguishing characteristic of the International
   Classroom Lexicon Project was the documentation of classroom pedagogical
   practices of mathematics teachers in the original languages of ten
   communities. These lexicons provide us with an opportunity to compare
   identified teacher practices within these communities. In this paper, we
   explore the challenges of conducting a cross-lexicon comparison to
   explore the possibility of moving towards an international lexicon by
   focusing on the Australian, Chilean, Czech and French lexicons. We focus
   on two clusters of terms, namely, those related to assessment and those
   related to mathematics. Inspired by theories and studies related to
   networking and boundary crossing, strategies were conceived and tested
   in order to accomplish the following objectives: to support a meticulous
   and comprehensive comparison of the lexical items; to classify the
   complexity of similarity of lexical items; and to reveal connections
   amongst the four lexicons in a bid towards developing an international
   lexicon. This analysis has the potential to contribute significantly to
   the study and promotion of mathematics teachers' reflective practice and
   highlights the cultural underpinning of the way classroom practices are
   perceived.},

Abstract = {In this paper we report on a survey study of teachers' perceptions of
   how mathematics textbooks, including broadly student books, teacher
   manuals, and exercise books, facilitate or hinder teachers' teaching in
   Shanghai educational settings. For the study we established a conceptual
   framework about teachers' teaching, partly drawing on Shulman's model of
   pedagogical reasoning and action of teachers. The data were collected
   from a stratified random sample of 133 mathematics teachers in 13
   secondary schools through a questionnaire, and follow-up interviews with
   24 of them. The results revealed the following: the textbooks were
   highly regarded and used by the Shanghai mathematics teachers as
   facilitators rather than barriers for their teaching and instructional
   change, and the facilitation was most evident in the process of
   transformation and comprehension, and least evident in evaluation in
   teachers' pedagogical reasoning and action; compared with student books
   and exercise books, teacher manuals played a larger facilitating role in
   teachers' teaching; and finally, compared with teacher characteristics,
   school characteristics had a greater influence on the extent to which
   textbooks played a role of facilitation or hindrance for teachers'
   instructional practice. Implications and suggestions are given at the
   end of the paper.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the construct of `uncertainty' in professional
   mathematics is investigated in relation to mathematical creativity.
   Specific focus is on `Big C' research mathematicians' conceptions of
   what uncertainty means and ways in which it influences their research.
   Based on the hypothesis that uncertainty is both a catalyst and a
   necessary condition for creativity, a qualitative research design was
   used to obtain and analyze data from a 4-year study involving 18
   research mathematicians who were at the forefront of their research
   domains. Data analysis using analytic induction confirmed the hypothesis
   that uncertainty plays an important role as a catalyst of mathematical
   creativity. The emergent categories from qualitative analysis revealed a
   dialectic or tension between (1) logic versus heuristics (synthetic
   versus analytic), (2) learner-researcher and researcher-learner
   transition, (3) axiom tweaking versus constraints. The findings of the
   study indicate that textbooks, unexpected moments, risk taking, and a
   community of support play a crucial role and characterize the interplay
   of uncertainty with mathematical creativity. The schema for
   understanding the dialectics of uncertainty sheds new light on an
   hitherto unexplored aspect of mathematical creativity, namely,
   uncertainty, vital for the development of mathematicians as researchers
   in addition to the growth of their discipline.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the process of instructional change required to
   translate data on student progress along learning trajectories (LTs)
   into relevant instructional modifications. Researchers conducted a
   professional development session on ratio LTs, which included analyzing
   3 years of district-level data from Math-Mapper 6-8, a digital LT-based
   diagnostic assessment application, with fifteen 6th and 7th grade
   teachers. Teachers subsequently conducted a lesson study to enact what
   they had learned, allowing researchers to study how teachers used data
   on student progress along ratio equivalence LTs to design, implement,
   and evaluate the lesson study. Researchers applied a framework for
   LT-based data-driven decision making to analyze video data of the lesson
   study activities. Teachers successfully scanned data reports to pinpoint
   the LT levels at which to target modified instruction. In one instance,
   they focused too narrowly on a single item resulting in excessive lesson
   time on tasks on graph literacy external to the LT. In the other, their
   data interpretation was overly general and resulted in the design and
   implementation of a sequence of tasks that reversed the order implied in
   the LT and relied on the use of more sophisticated strategies from
   subsequent LTs. Results suggest a need for more data interpretation
   skills, a deep understanding of the learning theory underpinning LTs,
   and more precision in teacher discourse around LTs.},

Abstract = {This article elaborates a theoretical, methodological, and analytical
   approach intended to highlight the materiality and reciprocity of
   noticing in mathematics classrooms. Drawing from highly resonant
   concepts from materialism and Indigenous Knowledges-two perspectives
   that researchers rarely bring into dialogue-this alternative approach
   explores the reciprocal, material, and more-than-human nature of
   noticing. By focusing on the role of movement in noticing, the approach
   discusses the indivisibility of sensing and making sense as students and
   teachers mobilize mathematical concepts. Applying this approach in a
   non-traditional analysis of two classroom episodes, the paper provides a
   discussion centered on what noticing looks like when humans are
   decentered, concepts are mobilized, and sensing meets making sense.},

Abstract = {Equity and ethics in the learning of mathematics is a major topic for
   mathematics education research. The study of ethics and injustice in
   relation to epistemic pursuits, such as mathematics, is receiving a
   great deal of interest within contemporary philosophy. We propose a
   bridging project between these two disciplines, importing key ideas of
   ``epistemic injustice{''} and ``ethical orders{''} from philosophy into
   mathematics education to address questions of ethics, equity, values and
   norms. We build on Dawkins and Weber's (Educ Stud Math 95:123-142, 2017)
   ``apprenticeship model{''} of learning proofs and proving, which says
   that mathematics education should reflect the practices of research
   mathematicians. Focusing on the norms and values implicit in
   mathematical proving, we argue that deploying this model unreflectively
   can lead to ``epistemic injustices{''} in which learners are
   disadvantaged based on their cultural or class background. We propose
   thinking about the problem in terms of Max Weber's ``ethical orders{''},
   and the clash that arises between the ethical orders of mathematics and
   the existing ethical orders of the learners and teachers of mathematics.
   Weber's lesson is that sometimes these clashes have no overarching
   resolution, and so the mathematics classroom may also have to settle for
   tailored pragmatic measures to combat individual cases of epistemic
   injustice.},

Abstract = {Research has highlighted the potential of digital technology to support
   the development of children's number sense abilities. However, the main
   focus of such research has been on apps affording directed interactions,
   where only one solution strategy is available, and it has targeted
   mostly cardinality. Little is known, in these terms, about task design
   and implementation in more open environments where several different
   solution strategies are available. To explore this direction, we chose
   to study TouchCounts, an open environment that combines multi-touch
   affordances with aural, visual and symbolic ones as well. Using tasks
   that were designed to address different number sense abilities, we
   experimented with 4-year-old preschoolers. In this paper we present two
   tasks, their expected potential with respect to strengthening number
   sense abilities, and analyses of data collected during the preschoolers'
   interactions with TouchCounts. The analyses reveal that the children
   used different strategies in response to the two tasks, and that a broad
   range of abilities related to number sense were elicited, including both
   cardinality and ordinality. An important contribution of this study is
   also a theoretical framework capable of identifying children's learning
   in a multi-touch environment.},

Abstract = {To contribute to the sparse educational research on student
   understanding of eigenspace, we investigated how students reason about
   linear combinations of eigenvectors. We present results from student
   reasoning on two written multiple-choice questions with open-ended
   justifications involving linear combinations of eigenvectors in which
   the resultant vector is or is not an eigenvector of the matrix. We
   detail seven themes that analysis of our data revealed regarding student
   responses. These themes include: determining if a linear combination of
   eigenvectors satisfies the equation Ax = lambda x; reasoning about a
   linear combination of eigenvectors belonging to a set of eigenvectors;
   conflating scalars in a linear combination with eigenvalues; thinking
   eigenvectors must be linearly independent; and reasoning about the
   number of eigenspace dimensions for a matrix. In the discussion, we
   explore how themes sometimes cut across questions and how looking across
   questions gives insight into individuals' conceptions of eigenspace.
   Implications for teaching and future research are also offered.},

Abstract = {The formal acceptance of a mathematical proof is based on its logical
   correctness but, from a cognitive point of view, this form of acceptance
   is not always naturally associated with the feeling that the proof has
   necessarily proved the statement. This is the case, in particular, for
   proof by contradiction in geometry, which can be linked to a loss of
   evidence in various ways, owing to its particular logical structure and
   to the difficulty in managing geometrical figures with contradictory
   properties. In this paper, we observe that students produce
   argumentation by starting with the assumption that the claim is false
   (indirect argumentation), and that they seem to accept this as more
   evident than the proofs by contradiction. On the basis of the notion of
   intuitive knowledge developed by Fischbein and through the analysis of
   task-based interviews, we investigate the intuitive acceptance of proof
   by contradiction and of indirect argumentation, underlining, in
   particular, that indirect argumentation can be produced as a compromise
   between a proof by contradiction and the need for a more evident
   argument.},

Title = {Acceptance criteria for validating mathematical proofs used by school

Abstract = {Although there is no generally accepted list of criteria for the
   acceptance of proofs in mathematical practice, judging the acceptability
   of purported proofs is an essential aspect of handling proofs in daily
   mathematical work. For this reason, school students, university
   students, and mathematicians need to hold certain acceptance criteria
   for proofs, which are closely tied to their epistemology, notion of
   proof, and concept of evidence. However, acceptance criteria have so far
   received little academic attention and results have often been related
   to mathematicians' acceptance criteria in a research context. Still, as
   the role of proof changes during mathematical education and differs from
   research, it can be assumed that acceptance criteria differ
   substantially between educational levels and different communities.
   Thus, we analyzed and compared acceptance criteria by school students,
   university students, and mathematicians in the context of teaching. The
   results obtained reveal substantial cross-sectional differences in the
   frequency and choice of acceptance criteria, as well as major
   differences from those acceptance criteria reported by prior studies in
   research contexts. Structure-oriented criteria, regarding the logical
   structure of a proof or individual inferences, are most often referred
   to by all groups. In comparison, meaning-oriented criteria, such as
   understanding, play a minor role. Finally, social criteria were not
   mentioned in the context of teaching. From an educational perspective,
   the results obtained underline university students' need for support in
   implementing acceptance criteria and suggest that a more explicit
   discussion of the functions of proof, their evidential value, and the
   criteria for their acceptance may be beneficial.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate a mathematical-metacognitive discourse
   model with IMPROVE metacognitive self-question prompts (What, How/When,
   and Why) in order to promote a deeper level of discourse in mathematics
   classes. The study involved 32 math teachers and 824 fifth-grade
   students (from 32 public schools) from one district in Israel.
   Participants were assigned to a randomized, controlled
   quasi-experimental trial, including an experimental group exposed to
   mathematical-metacognitive discourse, focusing on metacognitive skills
   (i.e., planning, monitoring, and reflection) used to arrive at
   solutions, and a control group exposed to mathematical discourse,
   focusing on cognitive knowledge (i.e., declarative, procedural, and
   explanatory). An in-depth analysis was conducted, using a mixed approach
   (quantitative and qualitative), of a recorded video teacher-student
   class discourse lesson at the end of the study in each class (n=32) as
   well as case studies of two teachers (one from each group) focusing on
   discourse pattern and their talk moves in class. The findings indicated
   that the experimental group exhibited more conceptual verbalization
   related to planning and reflection processes, whereas the control group
   scored the highest with regard to procedural knowledge. As a transfer
   measure from the intervention program at the end of the study, students
   in the experimental group outperformed the control group in terms of
   problem-solving and sensemaking performance. This study contributes
   further to understanding discourse by introducing the concept of
   mathematical-metacognitive discourse competence. Moreover, the study has
   practical implications for the promotion of discourse in mathematical
   lessons.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to present a succinct consolidation of the
   why, what and how of the Model' method as there is a lack of such
   documentation for researchers, practitioners and policy makers thus far.
   The Model' method is a tool for representing and visualising
   relationships when solving whole number arithmetic (WNA) word problems.
   The paper traces the history of the method in the Singapore school
   mathematics curriculum, exemplifies the three basic models of the
   method, explores its efficacy and assesses its role as a problem solving
   heuristic in the Singapore primary school mathematics curriculum. The
   findings show that the method, a tool for representing and visualising
   relationships between quantities when solving whole number arithmetic
   word problems, was introduced in 1983 as part of the primary school
   mathematics curriculum for schools in Singapore. The method comprises
   three basic models, namely the part-whole model, the comparison model
   and the change model. Past studies carried out both in Singapore and
   other parts of the world, related to the use of the method and its
   impact on student learning show that the method does help students,
   including those with mathematical difficulties, improve in their ability
   to solve whole number arithmetic word problems. Perceptions of expert
   primary school mathematics teachers show that they engage students in
   solving whole number arithmetic word problems through Polya's framework
   and also Newman's strategies. They encourage students to represent on
   diagrams the givens and goals of a problem as this is a necessary step
   in visualising and recognising relationships. To do so they may use the
   method. Students may also use any other heuristic to solve the whole
   number arithmetic word problems.},

Abstract = {This theoretical paper presents a methodology for instructional design
   in mathematics. It is a theoretical analysis of a proposed model for
   instructional design, where tasks are embedded in situations that
   preserve meaning with respect to particular pieces of mathematical
   knowledge. The model is applicable when there is an intention of
   teaching someone some particular mathematical knowledge. It is
   structured into four phases: epistemological analysis; development of an
   epistemological model; implementation; and, institutionalisation. The
   methodology is rooted in the theory of didactical situations in
   mathematics, and is built on two epistemological principles: the target
   knowledge should be an optimal solution to a task embedded in a
   situation; and, the milieu of the situation should provide feedback to
   students, whether their responses are adequate with respect to the
   target knowledge. These principles place the generic and epistemic
   student at the centre of instructional design in such a way that the
   focal point is on the student's opportunities to develop the knowledge
   aimed at-from an epistemological viewpoint. My research goal is to
   develop a model for instructional design where students will need some
   particular knowledge to solve a task and where the solution process is
   managed by features of the milieu with which the students interact.
   Through the concept of an epistemological model, the methodology enables
   a profound understanding of one of the phases of didactical engineering:
   conception and a priori analysis. Empirical data are provided to support
   the viability of the proposed model. The data are from an empirical
   investigation of student teachers' engagement with a situation where the
   target knowledge is a theorem in elementary number theory.},

Abstract = {To successfully solve the complex challenges facing us in the 21st
   century, people with expertise in the science, technology, engineering,
   arts and mathematics (STEAM) fields and other fields are needed,
   especially for their interdisciplinary way of thinking and working.
   These competencies should be learned in school, which first implies
   teacher education to that effect. In this article, a detailed
   theoretical reflection on the connections or overlapping areas between
   STEAM education and the dimension of sustainability in a model-like way
   is presented. It is also argued that mathematical modelling can be a
   possible instrument for promoting pre-service teachers' professionalism
   in STEAM education and education for sustainable development (ESD).
   Based on authors' developed model of this theoretical framework, an
   ESD-modelling seminar was created for pre-service mathematics teachers
   in which they also worked on that ESD and STEAM-based modelling
   problems. In the written reflections on the seminar, which were used as
   the survey instrument within the conducted empirical study, the teachers
   presented their subjective views on the connection between modelling and
   ESD. Based on an evaluation of these written reports by type-forming
   qualitative content analysis, three teacher profiles for handling ESD
   within mathematical modelling were developed. These types of teachers
   illustrate a strong awareness of promoting STEAM and ESD through
   modelling activities in their upcoming teacher life.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews research on equity in mathematics education
   (excluding gender equity) for the period 2017-2022. From the
   publications identified, five themes were distilled: conceptualizations
   and framing of equity in mathematics education; research methodologies
   and researcher positionalities; equity-focused practices, pedagogies and
   teacher education; equitable mathematics curriculum content, access and
   pathways; and equity in mathematics education at system levels,
   nationally and internationally. The review concludes by engaging some of
   the critique and suggests future directions for research. The research
   demonstrates that there is growing voice and visibility of
   equity-focused studies in mathematics education and that
   conceptualizations of equity have broadened and deepened through an
   increasing diversity of studies in this area. At the same time, the
   review also shows the dominance of the Global North in shaping equity
   discourses and the paucity of research on equity in mathematics
   education from the Global South.},

Abstract = {This paper is an examination of the way mathematics, and STEM, arises
   through stories of teaching and learning on, with, and alongside Land.
   It emerges from research, undertaken in different Nations (Cree, Dene,
   Metis, Mi'kmaw, Naskapi, Canada), that considers what locally meaningful
   K-12 STEM teaching and learning might look like in Indigenous contexts.
   The paper reflects our research process. Each story is followed by a
   conversation that surfaces elements of how mathematics, language,
   learning, and different ways of knowing, being, and doing circulate
   together and emerge in relation to Land and all relations living within
   it. We frame the work in ethical relationality to open a space where
   Indigenous and Western knowledges might co-exist, attending to ongoing
   tensions in the work between ways of knowing, being, and doing of
   different people and peoples/nations, between perspectives and
   experiences of indigenous and non-indigenous participants, between
   languages, while still creating spaces where we might move closer
   together through iterative processes of collective learning. This
   exploration provides insight into how and when we might remember that
   mathematics has spirit, how quantity and pattern live in various
   contexts, when numbers might be inadequate for a context, and how all
   these ideas can meaningfully inform mathematics teaching and learning
   via relationships between language, mathematics and learners. We seek a
   mathematics that resists abstraction as extraction and instead lives and
   enspirits teaching and learning through relationships.},

Abstract = {Lesson planning is of central importance to the teaching of all subjects
   in school. However, despite its high relevance, there is still a
   substantial need for a comprehensive review of factors affecting lesson
   planning. Empirical evidence on how teachers' competence in lesson
   planning can be developed, what challenges may be encountered during the
   lesson planning process, and successful lesson planning designs and
   practices should come to light on. To close this gap the current paper
   presents the results of a systematic review of 20 empirical research
   studies on teacher competence in mathematics lesson planning. For
   detailed insight into the most recent contributions of the reviewed
   studies on mathematics lesson planning, we analyzed studies conducted
   during the past decade, adapting the ``process model of lesson
   planning{''} and the model of ``competence as continuum{''} as a
   heuristic for approaching lesson planning. We present key results of the
   studies related to four major themes: (1) dispositions and their
   influence on developing and implementing lesson plans, (2) quality
   aspects of lesson plans and the development of lesson planning skills,
   (3) difficulties in lesson planning, and (4) the relationship between
   lesson planning skills and performance in implementation of lesson
   plans. The results of our literature review reveal that teachers
   (especially novice teachers) face difficulties in lesson planning and
   their overall competence (and knowledge) are not at an expert level.
   However, as the results of the examined studies pointed out, teachers
   can acquire such competence and knowledge through training within
   initial teacher education and professional development. Overall,
   teachers need support in planning mathematics lessons by delineating
   their lesson plan to improve their awareness of students' thinking,
   possible learning trajectories, effective usage of the curriculum and
   teaching resources, and the potential of innovative pedagogies that
   incorporate new technology.},

Abstract = {Previous research on bilingual mathematics education has proposed that
   as children ``language mathematics{''} they use multiple sources of
   meaning. In this paper, we focus on lexical inventions-bilingual
   children's made up words that are not formally defined or used but
   follow the phonology and morphology of a language-as a source of
   meaning. Consistent with tenets from translanguaging, we recognize
   lexical inventions as a creative language practice defying idealized
   language norms. A raciolinguistic theoretical perspective informs our
   interpretation of children, teachers, and researchers as listening
   subjects. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mathematical
   lexical inventions can prompt a translanguaging space where children,
   teachers, and researchers resist listening subject positions that
   predispose them to listen for predetermined language practices. Drawing
   on two lesson transcripts, one from a fourth-grade English-immersion
   classroom in Colombia and one from a third-grade Spanish-immersion
   classroom in the United States, we used moment analysis in
   translanguaging spaces to identify spontaneous and critical moments
   where lexical inventions prompted mathematical explorations. We argue
   for adopting listening subject positions as learners of transgressive
   language practices that are part of interactions between children and
   mathematics.},

Abstract = {In many schools across the world, students experience mathematical
   concepts as ideas empty of wisdom and possibility. In this paper the
   authors analyze a philosophical conversation in which fifth-grade
   students were caught up in the animacy of the concept of space.
   Challenging the common view of mathematics as dealing with absolute
   truths and certainty, these students, the materials, and the concept
   itself formed dynamic assemblages that, through movement and the senses
   reanimated philosophical considerations regarding the concept of space.
   Over the course of an hour, students emerged as young philosophers whose
   ideas about space converged with those of philosophers from diverse
   fields, including physics, indigenous education, feminist theory, and
   dance. Using a philosophical analysis, the paper focuses on the vibrancy
   of a space filled with forces-images, movement, ideas, and
   materials-that shaped students' relationships with mathematics and
   language. Based on this analysis, the paper provides insights for
   reimagining the teaching and learning of mathematical concepts as
   philosophical topics that can support a renewed understanding of the
   relationship between learner, language, and mathematics.},

   promoting cognitive engagement in secondary mathematics classroom
   practice},

Abstract = {Promoting engagement is crucial for encouraging student participation,
   interest, and learning in mathematics. Student engagement has been
   conceptualized as interrelated types comprising behavioural, emotional,
   and cognitive characteristics. Cognitive engagement, our focus in this
   paper, relates to students' psychological investment in learning and
   practices used to enhance learning, such as self-regulatory strategies
   and metacognitive processes. Although crucial for students' learning,
   research suggests that teachers' practices for promoting students'
   cognitive engagement are not well understood. In this qualitative study,
   we investigated the beliefs of 40 secondary mathematics teachers across
   eight English schools concerning promoting cognitive engagement in
   mathematics classrooms, and whether teachers with different cognitive
   engagement beliefs differ in the features of classroom practice they
   attend to in relation to promoting student self-regulation and
   metacognition. We developed a Cognitive Engagement Framework (CEF) for
   the following purposes: (1) to develop vignettes that described the
   practices of two contrasting teachers (Teacher A and Teacher B), who
   differed in their use of specific self-regulation and metacognitive
   processes; and (2) to use as a tool for analysis. 17 participants
   identified with Teacher A who favoured a controlling style towards
   student strategy use such as activating knowledge, planning, and
   enacting and regulating strategies, and a passive approach towards
   students' use of self-reflection. 14 participants identified with
   Teacher B who favoured promoting student autonomy for planning and
   enacting and regulating strategies, self-reflection, and acknowledged
   affective elements. In addition to its findings, the paper makes a
   methodological contribution by using `vignettes' as a new way of
   investigating teachers' beliefs, and a theoretical contribution through
   the development of the CEF.},

Abstract = {Mathematical problems can be divided into two types, namely,
   process-open and process-constrained problems. Solving these two types
   of problems may require different cognitive mechanisms. However, there
   has been only one study that investigated the differences of the
   cognitive abilities in process-open and process-constrained problem
   solving, and these researchers did not consider the influence of other
   closely related cognitive abilities. Therefore, in the current study we
   aimed to investigate the different cognitive mechanisms for process-open
   and process-constrained problem solving while controlling for related
   cognitive abilities. For this study we recruited 336 fifth grade
   students (mean age = 10.73 +/- 0.32 years old). The results showed that
   after controlling for age, gender, and other cognitive abilities,
   inductive reasoning (measured by nonverbal matrix reasoning) contributes
   only to process-open problem solving; language comprehension (measured
   by sentence comprehension) contributes only to process-constrained
   problem solving; spatial ability (measured by paper folding) contributes
   to both process-open and process-constrained problem solving; and
   executive function (measured by the Wisconsin card sort test)
   contributes to neither process-open nor process-constrained problem
   solving. These results suggest that cognitive abilities related to
   generating new information (e.g., inductive reasoning, spatial ability)
   might play an important role in process-open problem solving. In
   contrast, cognitive abilities related to retrieval prior knowledge
   (e.g., language comprehension, spatial ability) might play an important
   role in process-constrained problem solving. The current findings could
   promote the efficiency of learning and teaching by enabling the
   designing of different instruction for process-open and
   process-constrained problem solving according to students' cognitive
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {Beginning in the 1960s and early seventies, classroom research
   contributed to understandings and insights concerning the complexities
   and diversities of teaching. In the late 1990s, classroom research began
   to also include student voices in the classroom. Socio-cultural theory
   turned the empirical focus toward student interaction, and
   methodological development made new insights possible. The impact of
   this paradigmatic change is still in progress. At the same time, a rapid
   growth in international comparative classroom studies emerged, where the
   two most recognized comparative classroom research initiatives have been
   the TIMSS Video Studies, the first one initiated in 1995 at the
   University of California, Los Angeles, and the Learner's Perspective
   Study (LPS), initiated in 1999, at the University of Melbourne's
   International Center for Classroom Research (ICCR). In this paper, we
   ask what it takes to carry out successful international classroom
   research, using the LPS as an example. The analysis shows that the LPS
   project design made it possible for research groups from different
   countries and cultures to participate in building a sustainable
   community of research practice specialized in working with the
   complexities in the study of teaching and learning in classrooms. Of
   particular importance was the intense and sustained collaborative work
   on data, where researchers of varying seniority and experience met and
   carried out scholarly work in relation to a shared dataset. While also
   having disadvantages, the heavy emphasis on data was crucial for
   creating and sustaining a reflexive international research community.},

Abstract = {While patterning was commonly seen as evidence of mathematical thinking,
   interdisciplinary interest has recently increased due to
   pattern-recognition applications in artificial intelligence. Within two
   empirical studies, we analyze the analogical-transfer capability of
   primary school students when completing three types of bi-dimensional
   patterns, namely, numerical, discrete geometric, and continuous
   geometric. We found that the mechanisms involved in analogical transfer
   for continuing sequential patterns are based on two complementary
   cognitive processes: decoding and adapting. In addition, at a basic
   level of processing, students activate one of the operational tools of
   shape recognition or counting, and based on it, they find a surface
   analogy that leads them to use isometric transformations or
   one-dimensional development for continuing the given pattern. At a more
   complex level of processing, students activate both shape recognition
   and counting and are thus able to apply a filter of processing that
   uncovers a deep-structure analogy, which allows cognitive framing of the
   problem and leads to coherent 2D developments within the understood
   conceptual frame. At a more advanced level of processing, students can
   use a refined filter not only to uncover a deep-structure analogy but
   also to use an external language to verbalize that analogy, and
   consequently, to find 2D developments that trigger changes in cognitive
   framing, showing that pattern generation is a creative activity.
   Teaching and learning implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Problem posing has received increased attention among researchers and
   educators. One of the most important aspects is to understand the
   cognitive process of problem posing. In this study, we conceptualized a
   framework for the cognitive process of mathematical problem posing in
   three stages: (a) input-understanding the task, (b)
   processing-constructing the problem, and (c) output-expressing the
   problem. In this paper we focus on examining the role of task format
   (i.e., the presence or absence of specific numerical information, with
   or without context) in 669 students' problem posing and behaviors during
   the three stages of problem posing and problem solving. The major
   findings were that students' performance was better when the task
   contained specific numerical information (i.e., the task with context)
   than when it did not (the task without context) during the
   problem-posing stages of understanding tasks and constructing problems.
   Students' behaviors during the stage of expressing problems did not show
   a significant difference under the task format with (or without)
   numbers, but students could express problems more clearly under the task
   format with context than under the task format without context.
   Moreover, students who were able to solve the problem correctly were
   able to pose more mathematical problems and more solvable problems than
   those who couldn't solve the problem. In particular, students who were
   able to solve the problem correctly had a better understanding of the
   problem-posing task. However, students who were unable to solve the
   problem correctly were still able to pose solvable and complex problems.},

Abstract = {In this article, three of David Clarke's long time collaborators offer
   perspectives on how David shaped and continued to influence projects in
   which they were involved, over a 30 year period. The three sections of
   the article focus on David's contributions to original research on high
   stakes assessment, research on the development and use of assessment
   alternatives to traditional pen and paper assessments, and research in
   three smaller projects involving the use of open-ended questions, the
   implementation of the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics, and the
   complexity of the mathematics classroom, respectively. Through
   discussion of these various national and international projects, the
   authors provide examples of David's capacity to synthesise theoretical
   ideas, to appreciate the implications for classroom practice, and to
   communicate both perspectives to researchers, teacher educators and
   teachers. The authors argue that David's capacity to distil crucially
   important ideas into brief, highly insightful statements, was
   fundamental to the enactment and effectiveness of both research studies
   and projects for the teaching profession.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present a study of the most important Polish
   periodicals of the last 30 years that are related to mathematics
   education. Our research aim was to analyse how the changes in
   mathematics education that were caused by a new political situation in
   Poland were reflected in education journals. Journals that shaped Polish
   mathematics education varied significantly. We analysed both those
   journals that have a long history and those that arose spontaneously,
   thus reflecting the mood of this time of great change. Our analysis
   leads to the conclusion that journals, where the authors are mostly
   mathematics scientists or university lecturers, turned out to be in
   different to shifts in the educational system. A characteristic tendency
   reflecting the mood of times of change was the creation of new
   magazines, which were to be forums for sharing views on teaching
   mathematics. It turns out, however, that the journals created after 1990
   had quite a short lifespan. Education journals that were directed to
   teachers for decades constituted a platform for discussion of new ideas
   and teaching styles, too. They offered a place to exchange opposing
   views. However, this situation slowly ceased to apply.},

Abstract = {The research project partly presented in this paper aims at
   investigating the potential of the design of learning environments based
   on research to enhance language for mathematics learning in order to
   foster conceptual and language development. In this paper I present a
   collaboratively designed learning environment on angles, with a focus on
   enhancing classroom discourse to adapt to the conceptual development of
   most students in 6th grade. The theoretical background of the research
   combines Vygotskian and Bakhtinian points of view on language, and
   relies on the idea of a secondarising process of discourse. An empirical
   investigation of the enacted learning environment revealed its potential
   to enhance classroom discourse and students' conceptual and language
   development by introducing an explicit distinction between empirical and
   theoretical aspects of measurement concepts. The findings include the
   identification of conditions and limitations to be addressed in the
   design and instructional practices of mathematics- and
   language-integrated interventions, in general, and for the next steps of
   the current project.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to present the need for stakeholders to
   share an agreed-on Theory of Change (ToC) during the various phases of
   an implementation process. To this end, we draw on the Swedish Boost for
   Mathematics (BM), a large-scale national educational initiative, and its
   intrinsic `algebra' instructional module. More precisely, we analyze a
   cohort of official evaluation reports on the BM from the perspective of
   a critical case study. The BM's embedded algebra module and its
   associated material offer an instrumental example. This analysis relies
   on a selection of theoretical constructs related to Implementation
   Research (IR), such as (educational) innovation, value, stakeholders,
   degree of merit, policy dimension, theory-driven evaluation, and ToC.
   These theoretical constructs derive from both general IR and mathematics
   education research. We identify four phases of implementation, based on
   the analyses of the BM, namely, policy and organization, development,
   implementation, and evaluation. The analyses illustrate the need for
   alignment among these phases, associated with the endorsed, enacted,
   recognized and applied ToC of stakeholders. As a critical example, BM
   illustrates the many pitfalls of large-scale, scaled-up educational
   innovations-one of these being the potential failure of
   evaluations-owing to lack of an agreed-on ToC.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterise prospective kindergarten
   teachers' development of noticing children's thinking about length and
   its measurement. We used the concepts of instrumental genesis and
   learning trajectories to identify the ways in which prospective
   kindergarten teachers used a learning trajectory to learn to notice
   children's mathematical thinking. Following a teaching experiment, we
   identified three ways in which prospective kindergarten teachers used
   the learning trajectory to notice children's mathematical thinking. Two
   instrumented action schemes supported these ways of using the learning
   trajectory, namely, a scheme taking into account the mathematics
   learning progression to interpret children's answers, and a scheme for
   proposing instructional tasks based on the interpretation of children's
   mathematical thinking. Approaching the development of noticing as an
   appropriation process of a learning trajectory helps us to understand
   prospective teachers' difficulties in endowing meaning to a learning
   trajectory's conceptual structure. We suggest that these ways of using
   learning trajectory knowledge to interpret children's mathematical
   thinking and to make instructional decisions can be understood as an
   instrumentation process that reveals how noticing skills develop.},

Abstract = {Research on statistical education in childhood is recent in Brazil. The
   research has been mainly driven by curriculum reforms and the creation
   of research groups that investigate teaching, learning, and teacher
   education practices. The present paper emerges from this scenario and
   has the aim of investigating practices of creative insubordination of
   teachers proposing and acting on problems of statistical and
   probabilistic literacy under a problematizing perspective. The intention
   is to ask: `What evidence of statistical and probabilistic learning
   emerges when teacher-researchers participating in collaborative groups
   narrate their actions of creative insubordination?' The term `creative
   insubordination' refers to professionals acting counter to rules and
   directives when seeking to protect those to whom they provide services
   and in order to provide better conditions. In the case of Brazilian
   teachers, it is argued that they can be creatively insubordinate by
   proposing problems in statistics and probability, listening to the
   children and encouraging them to problematize and create strategies and
   procedures for solving statistical problems, in a perspective that
   encompasses their social practices. From the analysis emerged a common
   aspect of the teachers' practices that refers to the fact that they
   provide an investigative atmosphere in which children discuss, question
   and reflect, proposing creative solutions to statistical problems.
   Children learn to defend their views and rights. Thus, the statistical
   and probabilistic learning becomes more significant for children.},

Abstract = {How should we expect growing understandings of the nature of
   mathematical practice to inform classroom mathematical practice? We
   address this question from a perspective that takes seriously the notion
   that mathematics education, as a societal enterprise, is accountable to
   multiple sets of stakeholders, with the discipline of mathematics being
   only one of them. As they lead instruction, teachers can benefit from
   the influence of understandings of mathematical practice but they also
   need to recognize obligations to other stakeholders. We locate how
   mathematics instruction may actively respond to the influence of the
   discipline of mathematics and we exemplify how obligations to other
   stakeholders may participate in the practical rationality of mathematics
   teaching as those influences are incorporated into instruction.},

Abstract = {Geometry is used in different ways in the teaching of linear algebra. In
   this paper, I offer a typology of these ways, which I call varieties,
   and address three central questions. The first question is, What
   varieties of use of geometry in the teaching of linear algebra exist?
   This question is addressed through an analysis of six linear algebra
   textbooks, republished in multiple editions in the last decade or so.
   The analysis resulted in seven varieties, which can be used by
   researchers to investigate systematically the use of geometry in the
   teaching of linear algebra, in and outside the classroom. The second
   question is, What are the different impacts of these varieties on
   students' ability to accomplish the following: (a) abstract
   geometrically-based linear-algebraic concepts into general
   representations? (b) Extend geometrically-based linear-algebraic
   concepts to their counterparts in other models, such as space of
   polynomials, functions, and matrices? This question is addressed through
   analyses of a sample of various results reported in the literature. The
   third question is, What might account for these impacts? A conceptual
   basis underlying the results discussed in this paper is theorized.},

Abstract = {Mathematical and scientific knowledge are integral to preparing our
   population to be actively engaged and responsible citizens. Science and
   mathematics education, however, has mainly focused on concepts and
   skills detached from societal implications. In this paper we present an
   interdisciplinary international design research study in which we
   developed teaching and professional development materials connecting
   mathematics and science education to citizenship education. We outline
   the design research process, its theoretical basis as well as the design
   products. The study shows that it is indeed possible to develop such
   approaches supporting active citizenship and thereby the development of
   21st century skills in mathematics education, thus strengthening the
   role of mathematics education in the STEM field.},

Abstract = {Cross-curricula opportunities afforded by STEM education (Science,
   Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education), supports an
   environment where students can develop twenty-first century
   competencies. One approach to addressing cross-curricula opportunities
   in STEM education is the introduction of computer science (computer
   programming-coding) as a basic skill/literacy for all students. Coding
   (computer programming) is a language that draws on a set of syntax rules
   (or blocks for primary school students) that informs a computer program
   to execute a series of functions. While there is evidence that
   computational thinking (the thinking used for coding/computer
   programming) and conceptual development in mathematics are connected,
   there is limited research related to how such a confluence applies to
   primary school students. The aim of this article is to provide insight
   into how mathematical knowledge and thinking, specifically the
   identification of mathematical patterns and structures, can be promoted
   through engagement with coding activities. The data for this article is
   drawn from year 2 students (n=135) in two Australian primary schools. A
   teaching experiment approach was adopted for the study with a small
   intervention group (n=40) undertaking coding lessons for 6 weeks. Data
   collection comprised of pre-test and post-tests with a focus on
   patterning and coding in conjunction with video-recorded lessons. The
   study provides evidence that the learning that takes place through
   coding instruction can lead to higher levels of students' mathematical
   thinking in relation to identifying mathematical patterns and structures
   that can lead to generalisations.},

Abstract = {This article examines possibilities for using Valsiner's zone theory to
   understand identity formation of mathematics teachers and mathematics
   teacher educators. We situate our analysis within a sociological frame
   for identity research, in which identity is interpreted as an action
   rather than an acquisition. Valsiner's theoretical approach is based on
   Vygotsky's notion of the zone of proximal development, but adds two
   other zone concepts to account for environmental constraints experienced
   by an individual (zone of free movement) and the means by which other
   people in the environment promote the individual's actions (zone of
   promoted action). We briefly summarise our previous research that has
   used zone theory to interpret teacher learning as identity formation in
   two contexts, involving secondary school mathematics teachers and
   teachers of subjects other than mathematics who are embedding numeracy
   into the school curriculum. We then extend our theoretical investigation
   of identity to a new context in order to analyse identity formation of
   mathematics teacher educators, that is, mathematics educators and
   mathematicians who contribute to the preparation of future teachers of
   mathematics. Our analysis incorporates the idea of productive tensions
   into zone theory, thus creating a theory of goal-directed change that
   can be used to understand identity development and the role of
   individual agency within sociocultural contexts.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses how students explore, construct, validate and use
   statistical models when facing situations designed from a socio-critical
   perspective. The case study used is a statistics lesson designed by a
   statistics teacher and a researcher. The lesson centers on nutritional
   information and was implemented in a 7th-grade classroom at a public
   school in a Northwest Colombian city. In small groups, students gathered
   their own data, and subsequently organized and analyzed the data, and
   presented their findings to the class. The main sources of data were
   students' discourse in the classroom, students' artifacts and the
   researcher's journal. The findings describe a route in which students
   explore, construct, use, and validate their models. The results
   elaborate the technological and the reflective knowledge that took place
   in the model building activity.},

Abstract = {In the context of refinement of frameworks over the past decades within
   the domain of mathematics education research on language, the
   development of more nuanced theories is a challenge. In this issue of
   ZDM, a number of researchers present their work of exploration and
   elaboration of theories for the study and understanding of language in
   mathematics education. Since various relevant frameworks are present in
   the collection of papers, we use them to consider and evaluate the
   existing ontology. We aim to answer the following questions: What
   theories and concepts are visible in the papers? What are the works of
   some of the authors and terms that seem to be interpreted differently?
   What does this complexity imply for research in mathematics education?
   From the answers to these questions, we conclude that the domain can be
   characterised by its complexity, diversity, and contention. All three
   phenomena together seem to have the potential to be a strength for the
   progress of the domain.},

Abstract = {Assessment in mathematics is assumed to provide credible and important
   information about what students know and can do. In this paper we focus
   on large scale tests and question whether mathematics assessment is
   essentially gender neutral. We consider aspects of test validity and
   discuss issues of terminology related to gender and mathematics. In
   particular, we highlight examples of the ways that test content,
   response processes, and interactions with other variables such as
   socio-economic status and beliefs/attitudes can distort students'
   results and affect the interpretation of achievement outcomes. Where
   appropriate, we highlight findings from our own research.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the effects of large-scale studies, including
   international comparative studies and national studies using nationally
   representative samples, on policy making and practices pertinent to
   mathematics education in Taiwan, through the lens of Taiwanese societal
   and cultural characteristics. Taiwan has been through several successful
   and unsuccessful initiatives to apply the findings of large-scale
   studies to change or formulate policies with regard to mathematics
   curricula, assessment reform, approaches to teaching and learning
   mathematics for specific groups of students, and criteria for primary
   school teacher certification. Examination of these policy initiatives
   may reveal the mechanisms of success and failure when applying
   large-scale study results to education reform. These education reform
   insights may provide valuable information to other countries.},

Abstract = {The Instructional Quality Assessment (IQA) identifies the nature and
   quality of classroom instruction by considering students' opportunities
   to engage in cognitively demanding mathematical work and discussions.
   The IQA assesses ambitious mathematics instruction based on the
   following dimensions: potential of the task, task implementation, rigor
   of the discussion, teacher's questions, and accountable talk (e.g.,
   teacher's and students' talk moves related to linking and press). The
   IQA rubrics have been tested for reliability and validity by the IQA
   team and external researchers. The IQA has previously been used in
   research to assess ambitious mathematics instruction. Through looking at
   three episodes of classroom instruction, this article will highlight how
   the IQA can go beyond assessing instruction and serve as a tool to
   enhance instruction by providing formative feedback to mathematics
   teachers targeted towards planning and implementing cognitively
   demanding tasks. While the IQA's specific focus on assessing ambitious
   mathematics instruction may limit its applicability in research, when
   used as a professional learning tool, the IQA rubrics can provide
   explicit pointers to frame teachers' learning, self-reflection, and
   instructional change.},

Abstract = {For students working on realistic complex modelling problems as
   autonomously as possible the support by a tutor is indispensable for the
   students. However, how this support can be realised is still a question
   that has not been sufficiently answered. Based on prior research, it
   turned out that teacher interventions based on heuristic strategies
   might have a high potential to support students in a way that keeps a
   high level of independency using Zech's idea of strategic teacher
   interventions. This result led to the question of how far the heuristic
   strategies known from problem-solving theory appear in the modelling
   process. To answer this question an existing reconstruction of the
   solving process of the bus stop problem was analysed with regard to
   these strategies. This reconstruction itself was based on videos of
   students working on the bus-stop-problem in the prior study. Relying on
   the identified heuristic strategies, strategic interventions were
   created that could facilitate the modelling process of the students.},

Abstract = {The rise of digital resources has had profound effects on mathematics
   curricula and there has been a concurrent increase in teachers flipping
   their instruction-that is, assigning instructional videos or multimedia
   for students to watch as homework and completing problem or exercise
   sets in class rather than vice versa. These changes have created a need
   to better understand not only the features and learning affordances of
   these videos but also the phenomena of instructional videos taking the
   place of textbooks altogether. Drawing on an enacted mathematics
   curriculum framework, this article reports on a study of a mathematics
   teacher who implemented flipped instruction and created her own
   instructional videos and multimedia resources as replacements of printed
   textbooks. We examined the relationship between the teacher's printed
   textbook and the digital curriculum materials she used with her flipped
   mathematics classroom. We also explored her role in creating the digital
   curriculum materials and the ways in which those materials were used
   in-class. The case reveals similarities between the new material design
   and conventional textbooks and it also illustrates the teacher's
   simultaneous work designing and enacting digital curriculum materials.
   The broad issue of considering videos as curriculum materials rather
   than only as instructional representations is discussed.},

Abstract = {Embodied trainings allowing children to move their whole body in space
   have recently been shown to foster the acquisition of basic numerical
   competencies (e.g. magnitude understanding, addition performance).
   Following a brief summary of recent embodied training studies, we
   integrate the different results into a unified model framework to
   elucidate the working mechanisms of embodied trainings: Mapping
   processes, interaction between different regions of personal space, and
   the integration of different spatial frames of reference are addressed
   as potential factors underlying the effectiveness of embodied numerical
   trainings. In the concluding section, we elaborate on the practical
   applications of embodied numerical trainings in educational setting. We
   discuss under which circumstances embodied trainings work best, that is,
   for which age group and/or which numerical content embodied trainings
   should be most beneficial and which aspects need to be considered when
   aiming at applying embodied numerical trainings in formal educational
   settings like kindergartens or schools.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on instances of creativity in the design of Lesson
   Play tasks and in prospective teachers' responses to the tasks. A Lesson
   Play task assumes a theatrical interpretation of the word `play' and
   requires teachers to write a script for an imaginary interaction between
   a teacher-character and student-characters, attending to a particular
   instructional situation. These instructional interactions are triggered
   by `prompts' that present an unexpected student claim, or a particular
   erroneous conclusion or reasoning. I present a brief overview of the
   various iterations of task development. I then demonstrate instances of
   creativity in the design of Lesson Play tasks by teacher educators and
   in responses to the various prompts in the tasks by prospective
   teachers. The prompts for the plays and teachers' responses to the tasks
   are analysed using an extension of Lev-Zamir and Leikin's model of
   Creativity in Mathematics Teaching. While the original model attends to
   teacher-directed creativity and student-directed creativity, the
   proposed extension attends to mathematics educators in the role of
   teachers, and teachers in the role of students. I illustrate cases of
   pedagogical flexibility and originality as well as of mathematical
   creativity and originality, noting that multiple facets of creativity
   can be recognized in particular instructional choices. I conclude that
   Lesson Play tasks present a fruitful avenue for displaying and
   supporting teachers' creativity.},

Abstract = {Official documents in several educational systems reflect the importance
   of integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics
   (STEAM) and consider project-based learning (PBL) as a way of
   integrating such disciplines in the classroom. Although STEAM-PBL has
   been characterized and evaluated in different ways, its impact on school
   mathematics teaching remains unclear. Mathematics is recognized as the
   fundamental basis of other disciplines; however, many students still
   perceive it as a difficult subject and abandon it. To analyze STEAM-PBL
   classroom implementation from a school mathematics standpoint, we
   examined 41 classroom experiences from 11 Spanish secondary education
   teachers (five in-field mathematics teachers), who participated in a
   STEAM training program for more than 4 years. To frame this study,
   Thibaut et al.'s (J STEM Educ 3(1):02, 2018) and Schoenfeld's (Educ Res
   43(8):404-412, 2014) characterizations of well-designed and implemented
   projects, respectively, were employed. The results showed that in-field
   mathematics teachers avoided transdisciplinary projects in which school
   mathematics is difficult to address, while out-of-field teachers tended
   to overlook the mathematics in interdisciplinary projects. Unlike
   out-of-field teachers, mathematics teachers often eluded design-based
   learning processes for deeply exploiting school mathematics. The latter
   teachers promoted high cognitive demands and positive perceptions about
   mathematics in projects where formative environments were generated
   through discussion and a meaningful feedback loop.},

Abstract = {Inquiry into the teaching and learning of mathematics is a central
   aspect of the work of both the mathematics teacher and the mathematics
   education researcher, yet there are profound differences between the
   practices and processes underlying educational inquiries within each
   community. These differences are known to hinder implementation of
   research, yet they can also become a valuable resource. This paper
   explores a particular model of implementation of research: mathematics
   teachers adopt and adapt practices and processes of disciplined
   educational inquiry in a co-learning partnership with mathematics
   education researchers. We present a narrative inquiry of a
   teacher-researcher community that designed and studied classroom
   activities aimed at encouraging students to ask meaningful mathematical
   questions. The data analysis, informed by the literature on boundary
   objects and boundary crossing, highlights how the teachers and
   researchers leveraged their different processes and practices of
   educational inquiry as a resource in their collaborative inquiry. We
   conclude by suggesting that informed and thoughtful attention to the
   differences between teacher inquiry and disciplined inquiry may support
   and enhance mathematics education research implementation.},

Abstract = {Given the recent development of mobile gaze-tracking devices it has
   become possible to view and interpret what the student sees and unravel
   the associated problem-solving processes further. It has also become
   possible to pinpoint joint attention occurrences that are fundamental
   for learning. In this study, we examined joint attention in
   collaborative mathematical problem solving. We studied the thought
   processes of four 15-16-year-old students in their regular classroom,
   using mobile gaze tracking, video and audio recordings, and smartpens.
   The four students worked as a group to find the shortest path to connect
   the vertices of a square. Combining information on the student gaze
   targets with a qualitative interpretation of the context, we identified
   the occurrences of joint attention, out of which 49 were joint visual
   attention occurrences and 28 were attention to different representations
   of the same mathematical idea. We call this joint representational
   attention. We discovered that `verifying' (43\%) and `watching and
   listening' (35\%) were the most common phases during joint attention.
   The most frequently occurring problem solving phases right after joint
   attention were also `verifying' (47\%) and `watching and listening'
   (34\%). We detected phase cycles commonly found in individual
   problem-solving processes ('planning and exploring', `implementing', and
   `verifying') outside of joint attention. We also detected phase shifts
   between `verifying', `watching and listening', and `understanding' a
   problem, often occurring during joint attention. Therefore, these phases
   can be seen as a signal of successful interaction and the promotion of
   collaboration.},

Abstract = {This paper concerns the relationship between research and governance
   policy in three Swedish major development projects in mathematics
   education: the New Math project (1960-1975), the PUMP project
   (1970-1980), and the Boost for Mathematics project in (2012-2016). All
   three projects were driven or financed by the Swedish central school
   authorities. Using a historical comparative method, this study deepens
   the understanding of how research co-exists with governance policy when
   preparing innovations in mathematics education. The main historical
   sources are official reports and governmental decisions concerning the
   three projects. The analysis is focused on the nature of the innovations
   of each project and the role of researchers in the process of creating
   the innovations. The analysis highlights the theories and the methods
   involved in those processes. The three projects are also positioned in a
   context of school governance policy. In Sweden, the prevailing school
   governing policy changed from a highly centralised governance in the
   1960s to a highly decentralised governance in the 2010s. The paper
   concludes by discussing to what degree the researchers adhered to
   principles of research or school governance; in particular, the Boost
   for Mathematics project is considered in this regard. The relevance of
   the paper in relation to the emerging field of implementation research
   in mathematics education concerns how historical studies can give new
   insights about contemporary development projects in mathematics
   education.},

Abstract = {Teacher noticing has been widely understood as a kind of seeing or way
   of making sense of classroom events and instructional details. Such
   notions of teacher noticing often construe noticing as a disembodied,
   purely mental form of seeing and position the teacher as separated or
   separable from the observing environment. They rely on intuitive models
   that adopt the usual divide between mind, body, and matter, and that
   fuel the dualism between the individual and the environment. In this
   paper, I attempt to work towards a more comprehensive model of teacher
   noticing that instead proposes an entanglement of the
   cultural-historical, embodied-ecological, and social-material. Teacher
   noticing, in such a proposal, includes culturally and historically
   constituted forms of framing classroom events, embodied ways of
   accessing and exploring the classroom world, and active shaping and
   interaction with the classroom setting's social and material structure.},

Abstract = {Young children show large individual differences in their tendency to
   focus spontaneously on numerical aspects (e.g., numerosities or Arabic
   number symbols) of their everyday environment. The origins of these
   individual differences are unclear. Given the role of the home numeracy
   environment (HNE) in children's early mathematical development and the
   assumed link between children's spontaneous number focusing tendencies
   and their numerical behavior in everyday life, it is plausible that
   children's spontaneous focusing tendencies are related to their HNE. The
   present study aimed to test this hypothesis by longitudinally
   investigating children's spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON) and
   spontaneous focusing on Arabic number symbols (SFONS) in relation to
   their HNE. Participants were 128 children (4- to 5-year-olds), who were
   followed from the second until the third year of Flemish kindergarten.
   In both kindergarten years, children completed a SFON and SFONS Picture
   task while their parents completed a home numeracy questionnaire.
   Correlation analyses and structural equation modeling revealed no
   significant associations between children's spontaneous number focusing
   tendencies and their HNE, neither in second nor in third year of
   kindergarten. This finding suggests that children's spontaneous number
   focusing tendencies are not per se related to their HNE. Various
   possible explanations for this unexpected finding are discussed and
   directions for further research on this relationship are suggested.},

Abstract = {As technologies that put the body at the center of mathematics learning
   enter formal and informal learning spaces, we still know little about
   the teaching methods educators can use to support students' learning
   with these specialized systems. Drawing on ethnomethodology and
   conversation analysis (EMCA) and the Co-Operative Action framework, we
   present three multimodal ways that educators can be responsive to
   learners' embodied ideas and help them transform sensorimotor patterns
   into mathematically significant perceptions. These techniques include
   (1) encouraging learners to use gesture to express and reflect on their
   ideas, (2) presenting multimodal candidate understandings to check
   comprehension of learners' embodied ideas, and (3) co-constructing
   multimodally expressed embodied ideas with learners. We demonstrate how
   these techniques create opportunities for learning and discuss
   implications for a multimodal, embodied practice of responsive teaching.},

Abstract = {Mathematical knowledge involving whole number multiplication and
   division is integral to understanding multiplicative structures such as
   ratios, slope, rate of change, and proportions, which are important in
   subsequent mathematical learning. In this study, we investigated the
   effectiveness of a research-based intervention, schema-based instruction
   (SBI), to teach multiplicative whole number word-problem solving to
   three-fifth-grade students with mathematics disabilities. SBI emphasizes
   the underlying mathematical problem structure, uses visual-schematic
   diagrams to show how quantities in a problem are related, focuses on
   problem solving procedures grounded in reasoning, and highlights
   metacognitive strategy knowledge to monitor and reflect on the
   problem-solving process. We used a multiple probe across participants
   design to evaluate the functional relation between the SBI intervention
   and word-problem solving performance. Immediately following treatment as
   well as 1-3 weeks later, results indicated acquisition and retention of
   word problem-solving skills by all three students. In addition, the
   percentage of student use of representations (i.e., drawing a diagram,
   writing a number sentence) increased from the baseline to the
   intervention phases. These findings and their relation to theory,
   research, and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study we aimed to characterize the development of prospective
   mathematics teachers' noticing in an online teacher education program.
   Prospective teachers wrote narratives about their own teaching during
   their traineeship period at schools, and shared them with their
   colleagues and with the university tutor in an online forum. A narrative
   is a description of a teaching-learning situation that incorporates
   reasons about what has happened during the teaching, and justifications
   of plausible future teaching actions. We analyzed changes in the
   prospective teachers' narratives by scrutinizing how prospective
   teachers identify Mathematically Significant Pedagogical Opportunities
   to Build on Student Thinking (MOSTs) and in which ways they take
   advantage of them. Additionally, we analyzed whether these changes could
   be related to the feedback provided in the online forum. The findings
   indicate changes in how prospective teachers notice their practice,
   evidenced by the manner in which the MOSTs are taken advantage of, and
   by the reasons given for their actions. These findings suggest that
   sharing narratives in online forums and receiving feedback from their
   colleagues and from the university tutor help prospective teachers to
   enhance the skill of noticing, leading to changes in their practice.
   This research provides new knowledge about how online contexts in
   teacher education programs promote opportunities for collaborative
   learning, noticing development, and changes in teachers' practices.},

Abstract = {There is relatively little research specifically about student
   understanding of basis. Our ongoing work addresses student understanding
   of basis from an anti-deficit perspective, which focuses on the
   resources that students have to make sense of basis using everyday
   ideas. Using data from a group of women of color in the United States,
   we previously developed an analytical framework to describe student
   understanding about basis, including codes related to characteristics of
   basis vectors and roles of basis vectors in the vector space. In this
   paper, we utilize the methods of the previous study to further enrich
   our findings about student understanding of basis. By analyzing
   interview data from students in Germany, we found that this group of
   students most often used ideas that we describe by the roles generating,
   structuring, and traveling, and the characteristics different and
   essential. Some of the themes that emerged from the data illustrate
   common pairings of these ideas, students' flexibility in interpreting
   multiple roles within one everyday example, and the ways that the roles
   and characteristics motivate students to create additional examples. We
   also discuss two ways that differences between the German and English
   languages were pointed out by students in the interviews.},

Abstract = {This special issue includes contributions discussing the assessment and
   training of metacognition that appear promising for the purpose of
   positively influencing the learning process of students' learning of
   mathematics. More specifically, contributors explore, illustrate and
   scrutinize available research evidence for its relevance and
   effectiveness in the specific curricular field of mathematics education.
   After an introduction and discussion of the individual input, we explore
   the scientific progress in the area of the theoretical framework and
   conceptualizations of metacognition, the relationships between
   metacognition and mathematics performance, the various effects upon
   ability levels, the measures to assess metacognition, and the
   interventions that aim to improve mathematics performance. This special
   issue ends with a reflection on practical suggestions for mathematics
   education.},

Abstract = {This article presents a practice perspective of mathematics pedagogy and
   mathematics learning, by considering the interconnections between how
   developing a mathematics identity is bound up with the sayings, doings
   and relatings one experiences in classroom mathematical encounters.
   Broadly, mathematics education is fundamentally about stirring students
   into mathematical practices. In schools, doing mathematics is generally
   encountered in and through pedagogical practices that constitute
   lessons. Lessons, and the practices that compose them, create conditions
   for identity formation; thus one with a mathematical identity is someone
   who engages in mathematical practices (in everyday life and in
   classrooms). These practices are nuanced and site based. Considering the
   situatedness of lessons is an ontological view of mathematics education,
   and as such, offers an alternative view to the pervasive epistemological
   perspectives on mathematics learning, teaching and identity. To argue
   for a practice understanding of mathematics learning and identity
   development, practice theory is utilised as an analytic frame to examine
   empirical data from a primary school mathematics lesson. Findings
   delineate the ways that learning arises from being stirred into the
   characteristic site based practices, and mathematical identities are
   expressed in and, at the same time, exert pressure on the sayings,
   doings, and relatings encountered in lessons. From this, we argue that
   it is important that students engage in explicit substantive mathematics
   practices if they are to develop positive mathematical identities.},

Abstract = {Scholars interested in the function of language in mathematical learning
   often draw on Vygotsky, whose early work on word meaning has shaped many
   research studies. However, near the end of a rather short life, Vygotsky
   heavily critiqued his own previous work and began to sketch a radical
   theory revision, which overturns much of what he had done and is famous
   for. The purpose of the present study is to elaborate a possible avenue
   of such a theoretical revision. This study develops the new theory in
   the course of an exemplary analysis. The data derive from a scientific
   laboratory, where three scientists discuss a graph as it evolves in real
   time before their eyes and as a result of transformations designed to
   recover the real signal from the noise that is apparently present.
   Implications of the emerging theory for mathematics education are
   discussed.},

Title = {A new generation of mathematics textbook research and development},

Abstract = {This paper adopts a multimodal approach to the latest generation of
   digital mathematics textbooks (print and online) to investigate how the
   design, content, and features facilitate the construction of
   mathematical knowledge for teaching and learning purposes. The
   sequential organization of the print version is compared to the
   interactive format of the online version which foregrounds explanations
   and important mathematical content while simultaneously ensuring a high
   level of connectivity and coherence across hierarchical layers of
   mathematical knowledge. For example, mathematical content in the online
   version is linked to definitions, theorems, examples and exercises that
   can be viewed in the original context in which the material was
   presented, and the content can also be linked to mathematics software.
   Significantly, the development process for the new generation of
   mathematics textbooks involves using a `design neutral' markup language
   so that the books are simultaneously published as both print books and
   online books. In this development process, the structure of the
   chapters, sections, and subsections with their various elements are
   explicitly marked-up in the master document and preserved in the output
   format, giving rise to new methodologies for large-scale analysis of
   mathematics textbooks and student use of these books. For example,
   tracking methodologies and interactive visualizations of student
   viewings of online mathematical textbooks are identified as new research
   directions for investigating how students engage with mathematics
   textbooks within and across different educational contexts.},

Abstract = {In the present study we aimed to develop a multidimensional test
   assessing high school students' knowledge about triangles, and then to
   determine the validity evidence for it based on the internal structure
   and relations to another variable and its reliability. The test
   developed was administered to 557 tenth grade students. To assess the
   validity evidence based on the internal structure, the data were
   analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, inter-dimension
   correlations and two-way MANOVA across gender and school type. For
   validity evidence based on relations to another variable, the test
   scores were associated with previous semester geometry grades at the
   tenth grade level. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach alpha and
   item-total correlations to report internal consistency. The resulting
   instrument including 24 questions showed adequate validity evidence
   based on the internal structure and relations to another variable, as
   well as good reliability. This indicates that the results produced by
   the instrument are valid and reliable. So, the geometry knowledge test
   about triangles is well-suited for use in research and classrooms.},

Abstract = {Despite the incorporation of mathematical modelling in the Singapore
   mathematics curriculum framework since 2007, Singapore teachers still
   face readiness issues concerning the use of open-ended real-world
   problems. This paper presents some preliminary findings from an
   exploratory study undertaken within a professional development programme
   on mathematical modelling for experienced secondary mathematics teachers
   who are tasked to lead their schools in mathematical modelling. The
   research aims to gain insights into teachers' efforts at designing and
   assessing modelling activities, and their perceptions about facilitation
   challenges, for the purpose of proposing future directions in
   professional development towards more sustained, concerted efforts at
   incorporating mathematical modelling in Singapore schools.},

Abstract = {Posing modelling problems in class is supposed to increase students'
   motivation. As motivation is assumed to emerge from task value and
   self-efficacy expectations, the present study considered both constructs
   with the aims to examine (1) whether students have different values and
   self-efficacy expectations concerning modelling problems versus dressed
   up word problems and intra-mathematical problems and (2) whether
   mathematical content influences task value and self-efficacy concerning
   different types of problems. We asked 90 high- and middle-track students
   (ninth- and tenth-graders) how much they valued modelling problems,
   dressed up word problems, and intra-mathematical problems and if they
   were confident they could solve these types of problems. All of the
   problems that we used could be solved by applying mathematical
   procedures from two different mathematical content areas (Pythagorean
   theorem or linear functions). The results indicated that there were
   significant differences in students' task values and self-efficacy
   depending on the type of problem. Students reported the lowest task
   values and self-efficacy expectations for modelling problems compared
   with the other types of problems. Moreover, the differences between
   students' task values (but not between students' self-efficacy
   expectations) within the three types of problems seemed to depend on the
   mathematical content area. Intra-mathematical problems that could be
   solved by applying the Pythagorean theorem were valued higher than
   problems involving linear functions, whereas for modelling and dressed
   up word problems, it was the other way around. Implications for future
   research and classroom practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to explore how elementary preservice
   teachers' mathematics-science integrated teaching strategies changed as
   a result of participating in exemplary interdisciplinary activities with
   multiple themes across school curricula. The participating elementary
   preservice teachers (n = 28) were recruited for this study from the
   College of Education students enrolled at a medium-sized southwestern
   research university in the United States. A qualitative methodology with
   pre-andpost data collection from open-ended surveys was used in the
   current study to explore the development of preservice teachers'
   mathematics teaching strategies with connections to science themed
   activities before and after an 8-week intervention. In general, the
   results from the pre-and-post surveys revealed that the preservice
   teachers' interdisciplinary knowledge of using science-themed activities
   as instructional approaches for teaching mathematics had remarkable
   changes across all four science content areas including physics,
   chemistry, biology, and environmental and space science. This study
   provided additional empirical evidence on how contextualized mathematics
   educational activities, in the current case using the association
   between science and mathematics, can be used as effective teacher
   education resources for developing teachers' capacity for designing
   mathematics lessons.},

Abstract = {In teacher education, a key issue is how prospective teachers learn. At
   the University of Lisbon, based on an inquiry-based approach to
   mathematics learning, we developed a secondary school mathematics
   teacher education program, in which a central feature is the elaboration
   of a final investigative report based on teaching practice. In this
   paper, our aim is to understand the professional learning opportunities
   and difficulties recognized by prospective teachers (PT) in their final
   reports, by addressing the following research questions: (1) What
   didactical choices do PT mention regarding the approach to teaching, the
   use of tasks, resources and assessment strategies in their teaching
   practices? (2) What transversal elements of teaching practices do they
   recognize as enabling their professional development? and (3) What
   elements of the investigative work do PT refer to as major professional
   learning outcomes? Using content analysis, we reviewed, coded, and
   analyzed all 38 reports produced so far in the program. The results
   suggest that the PT embraced an inquiry-based approach to learning,
   valuing the role of suitable tasks and of whole class discussions. They
   also valued reflection and collaboration as practices that support
   professional development. Prospective teachers also indicated some
   difficulties and challenges in doing this investigation based on their
   teaching practice, but even so they tended to regard it a learning
   opportunity. We conclude that the final report, by its content,
   structure, and working processes as framed in this teaching education
   program, supports participants' development as teachers who hold
   research in positive regard.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses an important task teachers face in class: the
   identification and support of creative and high-achieving students. In
   particular, we examine whether primary teachers (1) have acquired
   professional knowledge during teacher education that is necessary to
   foster creativity and to teach high-achieving students, and whether they
   (2) possess the situation- specific skills necessary to do so. For this
   purpose, (1) the knowledge of German primary school teachers who
   participated in the TEDS-M study at the end of teacher education is
   analyzed. (2), a subset of these teachers interpreted classroom video
   scenes that require identifying and supporting creative and
   high-achieving students in the longitudinal follow-up study to TEDS-M
   (TEDS-FU) after 3 years of work experience. Contingency analyses between
   teachers' professional knowledge and their skills in identifying and
   supporting mathematically creative and high-achieving students were
   carried out. The analyses revealed that those teachers who have
   difficulties in logical reasoning and understanding structural aspects
   of mathematics also have difficulties in identifying and supporting
   creative and high-achieving students. It was difficult for them to
   identify students' thinking processes based on structural reflections
   and pattern recognition; moreover, they had difficulty in further
   developing mathematically rich answers by students. In line with these
   results, teachers with strong professional knowledge were able to
   identify and support mathematically creative and high-achieving
   students. Thus, the study reveals that a connection between teachers'
   professional knowledge and their skills in identifying and supporting
   mathematically creative and high-achieving students exists but that many
   future and early career teachers seem to have deficiencies in these
   respects.},

Abstract = {This article serves as commentary on the papers featured in the issue.
   Accordingly, these papers and the questions raised in them form the
   basis of its discussion. The papers, in turn, are addressing numerous
   aspects of creativity and working with the mathematically gifted, an
   area of study that has attracted considerable scholarly attention in the
   recent decades. This article attempts to elaborate on the findings and
   ideas of the discussed papers, specifically emphasizing the intrinsic
   connection between education for the mathematically gifted and general
   education, as well as the importance of the study and improvement of the
   practice of mathematics education. The piece starts with the discussion
   of a few relevant theoretical problems, then, following one of the
   papers in the issue, addresses the myths of gifted education and
   creativity, and then goes into other themes of the issue, including
   classroom practices and mathematics teacher education. At the end, some
   new research questions posed in the issue are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this article we review the research on the flexible or adaptive use
   of solution strategies in school mathematics, with a focus on the most
   recent work in the field. After a short introduction, we provide an
   overview of the various ways in which strategy flexibility has been
   conceptualized and investigated in the research literature. Then we
   review the research that has looked at the relationship between strategy
   flexibility and task proficiency, followed by studies that analyzed the
   association of strategy flexibility and other learner variables,
   including learners' age, general mathematical ability, prior knowledge,
   executive functions, gender, and affect. Studies addressing the
   socio-cultural and educational embeddedness of strategy flexibility are
   reviewed next, and, finally, we discuss the intervention studies that
   have tried to stimulate learners' strategy flexibility by means of
   various instructional approaches. While this review reveals that
   strategy flexibility is increasingly recognized as an important and
   valuable construct in research and practice of mathematics education,
   and that recently substantial progress has been made in our
   understanding of this construct, there are many aspects of it that are
   still not well-understood and that need further investigation.},

Abstract = {When the COVID-19 pandemic began, many universities switched to fully
   online teaching. This unexpected switching to online teaching was
   challenging for both teachers and students, and restrictions that were
   put in place because of pandemic made this challenge even greater.
   However, new ways of teaching might also open new opportunities for
   students' learning. The research question driving our study was as
   follows: how do students regulate their learning and specifically their
   choice of resources and peer learning in university mathematics classes
   that are fully taught online as offered during the COVID-19 pandemic? We
   report on a longitudinal, qualitative study in which students recorded a
   brief audio diary twice a week over one whole semester (14 weeks). We
   focused on three students who completed 70 interviews in total and
   finished the semester with varying degrees of success. The results show
   how the students structured their studying (e.g., the roles that
   deadlines or synchronous teaching events played). They illustrate the
   strengths and limitations of digital materials provided by the lecturer
   and the use of complementary media. Further, the pandemic uncovered the
   double-edged role of simple, often anonymous exchanges (e.g., via
   Discord servers), with few binding forces for either side, and the
   significance of stable learning partnerships for students' success. Our
   research highlights aspects that should be focal points when comparing
   traditional instruction and online instruction during the pandemic from
   a self-regulatory perspective. Practical implications refer to how these
   aspects can be combined sensibly in fully online courses, but also in
   blended learning contexts.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the theoretical background of mathematical
   modelling and its connection to citizenship education. Citizenship
   education in this context means that young people are equipped with
   competencies to respond as responsible citizens in situations relevant
   for society. To outline the connection between mathematical modelling
   and citizenship education in theory, we discuss the aims of mathematical
   modelling, modelling competences and the connection between numeracy and
   modelling. Based on these reflections we present an extended modelling
   cycle that specifically highlights modelling steps relevant to
   citizenship education. To show how the theoretical connection between
   mathematical modelling and citizenship education can be used in teaching
   practice, we describe three different examples of modelling tasks and
   analyse them with the help of the extended modelling cycle. We argue
   that the three tasks support different learning aims in relation to
   citizenship education and require modellers to carry out different steps
   of the extended modelling cycle. As an example of context, we used the
   pandemic caused by COVID-19, as it affected the quality of human life
   greatly, as all students in the Western world experienced.},

Abstract = {To date, of the many studies on early algebraic thinking, none, to our
   knowledge, has examined the relationships between algebraic thinking and
   negative numbers. Students encounter persistent difficulties in dealing
   with these numbers, and we believe that these could be addressed through
   the development of algebraic thinking. We are particularly interested in
   relational thinking, a form of algebraic thinking involved in
   generalised arithmetic, characterised by the ability to identify the
   structure of an expression as well as the relationships between numbers.
   The idea of the `subtractive number' has been highlighted in this
   context. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of relational
   thinking in dealing with negative numbers. We submitted a
   paper-and-pencil test to 166 grade 6 students in order to analyse their
   skills in operations with integers, as well as their relational thinking
   in questions relating to the compensation strategy in subtraction. We
   then examined the extent to which the students who answered the
   compensation questions correctly performed the operations with integers
   better than those who answered them incorrectly. Our results showed that
   students' ability to see the subtraction operation as a `transformation'
   involving a unary use of the minus sign appears to be a factor in their
   success in operations with negatives. Few students demonstrated this
   ability, yet it can be seen as an essential stage on which to base the
   progressive development of relational thinking.},

Abstract = {In the HPM (History and Pedagogy of Mathematics) literature, the three
   mathematicians Henri Poincare (1854-1912), Felix Klein (1849-1925), and
   Hans Freudenthal (1905-1990) are often mentioned in relation to having
   opinions about the role of the history of mathematics in the teaching
   and learning of mathematics. Such mentioning often appears without any
   further account of their viewpoints. In the paper, we seek to dig more
   deeply, asking the questions of what these three mathematicians' views
   on history in mathematics education were, how they themselves expressed
   these, and what the similarities and differences might be. Our departure
   point was the known texts by the three mathematicians in which they
   touch upon aspects of the history of mathematics in relation to teaching
   and learning, or mathematics education in general. When possible, these
   written works were accompanied by secondary accounts. Finally, we draw
   perspectives concerning the issue of how the views of these three
   mathematicians may or may not align with some of the trends in modern
   day HPM research.},

Abstract = {The knowledge and skills that mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) need
   to have for teaching mathematics teaching is a fundamental issue that
   influences their preparation and development. In particular, considering
   that mathematics teaching comprises MTEs' teaching work, do MTEs need to
   have school teaching experience and, if so, in what ways does school
   teaching experience play a role in their teaching? In this exploratory
   study, we describe how school teaching experience relates to teaching
   prospective secondary mathematics teachers (PSMTs) how to teach
   mathematics, from the perspective of university-based Chinese MTEs, via
   in-depth interviews. The interviewees generally agreed on the importance
   of school teaching experience by identifying various aspects of school
   teaching experience that relate to the knowledge, competency, and
   disposition needed for teaching mathematics teaching, but they also
   suggested that school teaching experience requires renewal, growth, and
   connection with educational theories and research. This suggests that
   school mathematics teaching experience is necessary but insufficient on
   its own for teaching mathematics teaching. This study also suggests the
   differences in capacity between teaching-based and non-teaching-based
   experience in understanding of and dealing with the relation between
   process and product, and the relation between theory and practice
   involved in teaching how to teach mathematics.},

Abstract = {Noticing is a crucial part of any teachers' classroom practices. Given
   its importance, research in teacher noticing has gained traction and has
   significantly increased in recent years. In this survey paper, we
   explore the terrains of research on teacher noticing in three areas:
   conceptualisations of teacher noticing, methodological approaches for
   studying teacher noticing, and contexts within which studies of teacher
   noticing are situated. We synthesize emerging ideas and insights by
   contributing authors along these strands to describe the current state
   of teacher noticing research and papers included in this special issue
   (2021-1) of ZDM-Mathematics Education and conclude by raising questions
   to chart future directions for research.},

Abstract = {Engaging students in mathematical argumentation supports language
   development and conceptual understanding because students use verbal and
   written language in coordination with mathematical representations to
   notice patterns, make claims, and create and revise explanations. This
   study adds to the limited research base on how teachers learn to
   facilitate discussions specifically aimed to develop students'
   capacities to engage in argumentation. We analyze teachers' sensemaking
   about supporting argumentation in the classroom through their
   participation in an adaptive professional development (PD) design. The
   PD was embedded in two elementary schools with upper grade teachers
   which enabled them to engage in iterative cycles of investigation and
   enactment within their own classrooms. Through collaborative lesson
   design and inquiry into students' experiences, teachers attended to the
   language students produced as they tried to formulate conjectures and
   produce explanations and the classroom participation structures that
   supported them. Our results suggest shifts in how teachers understood
   their role. Both cases speak to the complexities teachers face as they
   try to realize the recommendations for enhancing language learning and
   provide insight into what ``rich{''} discourse means.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present the results of a survey of research studies on
   the learning of multivariable calculus in a wide geographic spectrum.
   The goal of this study is to describe what research results tell us
   about students' learning of calculus of two-variable functions, and how
   they inform its teaching. In spite of the diversity of cultures and
   theoretical approaches, results obtained are coherent and similar in
   terms of students' learning, and of teaching strategies designed to help
   students understand two-variable calculus deeply. Results show the need
   to introduce students to the geometry of three-dimensional space and
   vectors, the importance of the use of graphics and geometrical
   representations, and of thorough work on functions before introducing
   other calculus topics. The reviewed research deals in different ways
   with the idea of generalization concerning how students' knowledge of
   one-variable calculus influences their understanding of multivariable
   calculus. Some research-based teaching strategies that have been
   experimentally tested with good results are included. Results discussed
   include the following: basic aspects of functions of two variables,
   limits, differential calculus, and integral calculus. The survey shows
   that there is still a need for research using different theoretical
   perspectives, on the transition from one-variable calculus to
   two-variable and multivariable calculus.},

Abstract = {In this paper we report on the impact of a year-long teacher
   professional development (PD) workshop on student problem-solving
   skills. The PD workshop was held in Chile and promoted the use of
   collaborative problem-solving activities in the classroom, through
   monthly sessions during the school year. Participant teachers met with a
   monitor to solve a new problem collaboratively, plan a problem-solving
   activity for their next lesson, and reflect on their activities from
   their previous lesson. The study documents the performance of two groups
   of students when solving non-routine mathematics problems in two similar
   and non-equal tests consisting of three problems each, before and after
   the year of application of the workshop. The first group of students was
   the experimental group with collaborative problem-solving activities, as
   proposed in the PD workshop. The second group was the control group,
   composed of students whose teachers followed traditional teaching. In
   the first part of the paper we present the results of pre- and
   post-tests in which the students in the experimental group improved
   their problem-solving performance in a significant way compared with the
   control group. In the second part, we present a sample of representation
   strategy used by successful students in both groups and we discuss, in
   general, student strategies in solving test problems.},

Abstract = {Teacher education is central to the development of the professional
   knowledge of pre-service teachers. The main goal of this paper is to
   reflect on the development that the analysis (done by a group of
   pre-service secondary teachers) of a set of tasks, based on elements
   related to domains of KTMT-Knowledge for Teaching Mathematics with
   Technology-can bring to the knowledge of pre-service teachers of
   mathematics. Specifically, the goal was to investigate the following
   questions: (1) What are the factors that guide the pre-service teachers'
   task discussion? (2) Which KTMT domains are emphasized by pre-service
   teachers during task discussion? The elements taken into account are the
   characteristics of the tasks (focus on cognitive level, structuring
   level and technology role), the use of representations (focus on balance
   and articulation of representations), and the equilibrium between
   experimentation (focus on digital technology affordances) and
   justification (focus on argumentation and proof). The methodology of
   this case study involves a qualitative approach. The main conclusions
   suggest that influences in the pre-service teachers' discussion of tasks
   fell into the following categories: the potentialities of technology,
   the type of tasks, and the prospective teachers' experience with a set
   of tasks, and analysis of some real students' reports. With regard to
   KTMT, although it was possible to identify some global
   development,Teaching and Learning and Technology Knowledgewas the domain
   in which stronger development took place.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces two central questions (1) what are available
   methodologies for making claims about mathematical practice and (2) when
   and how do claims about mathematical practice influence mathematics
   instruction. To motivate these questions, we critically analyze the
   relationship between research into mathematicians' practice and the
   design of mathematics instruction in three ways. First, we describe
   three influential research programs in mathematics education and
   illustrate how each research program uses claims about mathematical
   practice to inform their instructional goals. Second, by examining these
   important works, we highlight intrinsic difficulties in investigating
   mathematical practice. Our conclusion is that every research methodology
   for investigating mathematical practice is fundamentally limited and we
   require triangulation from multiple methods and theoretical lenses to
   fully understand mathematical practice. Third, we highlight reasons for
   why mathematical practice sometimes should not inform mathematics
   instruction. We conclude this paper by discussing how the articles in
   this special issue address our two central questions.},

   solving mathematical modelling tasks requiring their assumptions},

Abstract = {Mathematization is critical in providing students with challenges for
   solving modelling tasks. Inadequate assumptions in a modelling task lead
   to an inadequate situational model, and to an inadequate mathematical
   model for the problem situation. However, the role of assumptions in
   solving modelling problems has been investigated only rarely. In this
   study, we intentionally designed two types of assumptions in two
   modelling tasks, namely, one task that requires non-numerical
   assumptions only and another that requires both non-numerical and
   numerical assumptions. Moreover, conceptual knowledge and procedural
   knowledge are also two factors influencing students' modelling
   performance. However, current studies comparing modelling performance
   between Western and non-Western students do not consider the differences
   in students' knowledge. This gap in research intrigued us and prompted
   us to investigate whether Taiwanese students can still perform better
   than German students if students' mathematical knowledge in solving
   modelling tasks is differentiated. The results of our study showed that
   the Taiwanese students had significantly higher mathematical knowledge
   than did the German students with regard to either conceptual knowledge
   or procedural knowledge. However, if students of both countries were on
   the same level of mathematical knowledge, the German students were found
   to have higher modelling performance compared to the Taiwanese students
   in solving the same modelling tasks, whether such tasks required
   non-numerical assumptions only, or both non-numerical and numerical
   assumptions. This study provides evidence that making assumptions is a
   strength of German students compared to Taiwanese students. Our findings
   imply that Western mathematics education may be more effective in
   improving students' ability to solve holistic modelling problems.},

Abstract = {Informal strategies reflecting the representation of a situation
   described in an arithmetic word problem mediate students' solving
   processes. When the informal strategies are inefficient, teaching
   students to make way for more efficient ways to find the solution is an
   important educational issue in mathematics. The current paper presents a
   pedagogical design for arithmetic word problem solving, which is part of
   a first-grade arithmetic intervention (ACE). The curriculum was designed
   to promote adaptive expertise among students through semantic analysis
   and recoding, which would lead students to favor the more adequate
   solving strategy when several options are available. We describe the
   ways in which students were taught to engage in a semantic analysis of
   the problem, and the representational tools used to favor this
   conceptual change. Within the word problem solving curriculum, informal
   and formal solving strategies corresponding to the different formats of
   the same arithmetic operation, were comparatively studied. The
   performance and strategies used by students were assessed, revealing a
   greater use of formal arithmetic strategies among ACE classes. Our
   findings illustrate a promising path for going past informal strategies
   on arithmetic word problem solving.},

Abstract = {We report on the construction, validation, and implementation of an
   instrument for measuring students' strategic knowledge about drawing for
   geometry modelling problems, namely, the strategic knowledge about
   drawing scale. We conducted a qualitative study and a quantitative study
   to validate the proposed construction and interpretation of the scale
   and to obtain initial findings on students' strategic knowledge about
   drawing. Results showed that ninth-grade students in the intermediate
   achievement track had less elaborated strategic knowledge about drawing
   than their peers in the high achievement track. Further, strategic
   knowledge about drawing was found to be related to drawing accuracy and
   modelling performance even when cognitive abilities and interest were
   controlled for. The current study suggests that promoting strategic
   knowledge about drawing might be a means to increase drawing and
   modelling performance-especially among non-high-achieving students.},

Abstract = {In this study, I examined seven first-year linear algebra students'
   linear independence schemas. Data came from participants' interview
   responses to a set of nine questions. The analysis focused on the
   identification of concepts and connections pertaining to plans and
   activations. Overall, the findings revealed the existence of routinized
   plans, each containing one of six most frequently expressed connections.
   Moreover, I observed some participants activating these plans as fixed
   plans, and other participants activating them as ready-to-hand plans.
   Some activations were task specific. In short, I found participants'
   linear independence schemas to be populated by three main routinized
   plans, each with varying characteristics.},

Abstract = {Reflection is an important part of teaching and needs to be considered
   carefully. In this study, we examined a mathematics instructor's
   reflections on teaching linear algebra. The research team employed
   Tall's (How humans learn to think mathematically: exploring the three
   worlds of mathematics. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2013)
   framework to track the instructor's movements between the three worlds
   of mathematical thinking. The instructor emphasized the importance of
   symbolic and embodied thinking and made sure the students were ready
   before entering the formal world. It became evident that moving the
   class between the worlds appropriately at certain moments was critical
   to students' understanding of the concept, however at times required
   much anticipation and careful preparation in advance as well as creating
   appropriate teaching resources. The instructor's dual role as a
   researcher and participant resulted a model of instructional decision
   making which was used to give further insights during his movements
   between Tall's worlds and afforded him unique opportunities for
   reflection and subsequent carefully calculated class interventions.},

Abstract = {Although many scholars in the field of mathematics education are aware
   that identity discourses are highly political, research in the field
   usually lacks a framework theoretically and methodologically to address
   the political dimension of identity research. Based on Laclau and
   Mouffe's discourse theory and the case of a female secondary school
   student at a German public school, the present paper analyses identity
   as a socio-political process of identity work articulated around the
   discourse of refusing school mathematics' in our contemporary times. Her
   refusal of mathematics is constituted around issues related to a series
   of noted classroom practices such as collective work, being together and
   having fun, relevance of mathematics in society and life, respect of
   one's own dignity instead of becoming humiliated, and bodily activity
   instead of seated work. We illustrate how discourse theory allows us to
   see the identity work of refusing mathematics as a contingent process in
   a discursive field of socio-political struggle. In this process the
   subject moves beyond an essentialist refusal' of mathematics learning
   towards articulating her refusal of a particular mathematics education
   socio-materiality that needs to become subverted and reworked into more
   affirmative terms.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have reported the influence of professional development
   (PD) on participating teachers' identities. However, what goes on in
   PDs, how and why they shape particular identities require further
   investigation. This study contributes in this direction by drawing on
   the notions of practice-linked identities and identity resources to
   examine how two teachers' mathematics teaching identities developed
   following their interactions with the resources offered in a particular
   PD. We argue that their developing mathematics teaching identities
   appeared to be linked to their backgrounds and initial motivations for
   joining the PD, which in turn influenced their selective interaction
   with resources. Implications for research and PD are discussed.},

Abstract = {Whole Number Arithmetic (WNA) appears as the very first topic in school
   mathematics and establishes the foundation for later mathematical
   content. Without solid mastery of WNA, students may experience
   difficulties in learning fractions, ratio and proportion, and algebra.
   The challenge of students' learning and mastery of fractions, decimals,
   ratio and proportion, and algebra is well documented. Most of this
   research has focused on either fractions, decimals, ratio and
   proportion, algebra, or WNA. There is a lack of research that addresses
   the connection between these relevant topics. Within WNA, most research
   focuses on counting, computation, or solving word problems. There is a
   lack of research that investigates connections within WNA. This special
   issue is intended to bridge this research gap by explicitly highlighting
   the conceptual knowledge of counting, calculations, and quantity
   relationships, as well as the structure of word problems within and
   beyond WNA.},

Abstract = {Initial research has shown that simulating data from models created with
   computer software may enhance students' understanding of concepts in
   introductory statistics; yet, there is little research investigating
   students' development of statistical models. The research presented here
   examines small groups of students as they develop a model for a
   situation where a music teacher plays ten notes for a student who tries
   to guess each of the notes correctly. As students constructed their
   models and described their thinking, their descriptions were narrative
   in nature, focusing on the story of notes played and guessed. In this
   context, their focus on narrative appeared to support the development of
   productive statistical models. In addition, when students investigated
   pre-built TinkerPlots models, they preferred models that they perceived
   as more communicative or narrative in nature. These results have
   important pedagogical implications in terms of designing modeling
   curriculum.},

Abstract = {The aim is to contribute to the research on the conception and
   development of mathematics textbooks for undergraduate distance
   education courses (EAD). In particular, we acknowledge the EAD
   undergraduate courses in Brazil as an important governmental initiative
   for teacher education. Amongst other specificities of the Brazilian
   model of distance education, one aspect consists of writing proper
   material and textbooks, raising a need to investigate the results of
   their conception and development. We report on a case study in which a
   chapter in a written textbook developed by a group of professors is
   analysed according to hermeneutics, describing the tessiture of the text
   and context of the implemented task. Aware that the task demanded
   processes different from those used when writing textbooks for
   face-to-face lecture courses, though at the same time not coinciding
   with the wordings of the interactions of a classroom lecture, the group
   of authors agreed on a notion of lessons on paper. Our analysis faces
   the challenge of problematising qualitative differences regarding the
   semiotic means of the mathematics embedded in face-to-face versus
   distance learning activities, raising questions on the nature of their
   results and the development of induced thinking in both contexts.
   Investigating the kind of mathematical knowledge produced for the
   lessons on paper texts, we drew on whether the written lesson for
   distance education is closer to the pedagogical-content knowledge than
   to the classical academic knowledge.},

Abstract = {Several nations have reformed both their mathematics pedagogy and
   curriculum. The remaining challenge is to review teaching and learning
   resources to support the renewed pedagogy and curriculum. This paper
   responds to the following question: what pedagogy and curriculum are
   depicted in textbooks used in Uganda? Ugandan textbooks were analyzed in
   terms of mathematics content structure and genre, and presentation of
   written and non-written voice and looks (appearance). Whereas certain
   Ugandan mathematics textbooks used the narrative form and others chose
   to eliminate the use of extensive text, these textbooks include common
   characteristics such as spiral coverage of mathematics content. A few
   strides toward reform pedagogy, such as use of contexts familiar to
   learners in development of rules and concepts, were evinced among
   selected Uganda textbooks. More strides are needed in revising a
   majority of textbooks to align with the renewed curricula on certain
   aspects including integrating learning tools-digital and
   non-digital-within the textbook resources. A critical reflection on
   curriculum renewals adopted from other countries is needed when
   designing textbooks to match these renewals.},

Title = {Going beyond structured observations: looking at classroom practice
   through a mixed method lens},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {521-534},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we extend a mixed method (MM) approach to lesson
   observation and analysis used in previous research in England, combining
   multiple structured observation instruments and qualitative field notes,
   to provide a framework for studying three videotaped lessons from
   3rd-grade US mathematics classrooms. Two structured observation
   schedules are employed, one subject-specific and research-oriented and
   the other generic and inspection-oriented. Both instruments were
   previously developed based on evidence from the teacher effectiveness
   research (TER) knowledge base. Qualitative field notes, in addition to
   structured observation schedules, provide detailed narratives for each
   lesson video. Separate findings from each instrument and approach are
   presented, followed by an integrated analysis and synthesis of results.
   Although previous studies used similar methods to analyze teaching
   practice within broader research designs incorporating additional
   methods and perspectives (e.g. teacher interviews, pupil assessments,
   pupil questionnaires), this paper explicitly examines the strengths and
   limitations of the multi-instrument, mixed method approach to lesson
   observation. Using multiple observation instruments allows for
   triangulation as well as consideration of complementary foci (i.e. a
   content-specific instrument measures fine-grained aspects of practice
   not emphasized in a more generic instrument, and vice versa). Field
   notes facilitate rich descriptions and more thorough contextualization
   and illumination of teaching practice than structured observation
   ratings alone. Further, the MM approach allows for consideration of
   lesson features beyond those established in TER literature as sufficient
   to characterize `effective' practice.},

Abstract = {The investigations described in the ten fascinating research studies
   contained in the current volume of ZDM Mathematics Education evoke some
   perspectives in response. I consider the articles thematically in
   relation to a suggested set of important or pressing questions about
   creativity and giftedness in mathematics education, grouped into four
   areas: (1) definitions and meanings, (2) learning environments, (3)
   teacher preparation, (4) educational policies and societal trends. The
   first three of these areas are addressed most specifically; the latter
   is given less attention, with much remaining to be researched. In the
   context of the topics most addressed, possible emphases in studying
   mathematical creativity and giftedness include cognitive, affective,
   conative (motivational), social, and behavioral aspects. The studies
   here focus mostly on the cognitive, social, and behavioral dimensions. I
   highlight some specific findings, offer comments, and suggest the need
   for greater future emphasis on affective and motivational variables. My
   response concludes with consideration of the value of prioritizing
   mathematical creativity and giftedness (or high ability), noting some
   troubling policy directions and societal trends that should be taken
   into serious account and studied.},

Abstract = {Creativity and giftedness in mathematics education research are topics
   of an increased interest in the education community during recent years.
   This introductory paper to the special issue on Mathematical Creativity
   and Giftedness in Mathematics Education has a twofold purpose: to offer
   a brief historical perspective on the study of creativity and
   giftedness, and to place an emphasis on the added value of the present
   volume to the research in the field. The historical overview addresses
   the development of research and practice in creativity and giftedness
   with specific attention to creativity and giftedness in mathematics. We
   argue that this special issue makes a significant contribution to
   bridging domain-general theories of creativity and giftedness with
   theories in mathematics education with special attention given to
   nurturing these phenomena in the process of mathematics teaching and
   learning.},

Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 18},
Abstract = {In this paper we review selected significant developments in the use of
   digital technology in the teaching and learning of mathematics over the
   last five years. We focus on a number of important topics in this field,
   including the evolvement of STEAM and critical making as well as the
   process of redefining learning spaces in the transformation of the
   mathematics classroom. We also address the increasing use of computer
   algebra systems and dynamic geometry packages; and the issue of student
   collaboration online, especially using learning environments and social
   media. We briefly touch on artificial intelligence systems, including
   hyper-personalisation of learning, multimodality and videos. We include
   a brief discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on mathematics education,
   and lastly on the more theoretical perspective of the epistemology of
   digital technology and the construct of humans-with-media. We conclude
   the discussion with some possible concerns and mentioning some possible
   new topics for research in the field.},

Title = {Teaching for statistical and data literacy in K-12 STEM education: a
   systematic review on teacher variables, teacher education, and impacts
   on classroom practice},

Abstract = {Statistical and data literacy have emerged as key competencies in the
   21st-century. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   curricula have been adapted in various countries to place increased
   emphasis on proficient data use and statistical comprehension.
   Consequently, there is a need for an adequate education and professional
   training of STEM teachers. This systematic review analyzes and
   synthesizes research on teachers' statistical and data literacy in K-12
   STEM education. A total of 42 articles were analyzed, with a specific
   focus on teacher variables, teacher education, and their impact on
   classroom practice. The findings emphasize the recent emergence of
   research in this domain, particularly focusing on statistical literacy,
   with mathematics being the dominant STEM domain explored. Most studies
   examined cognitive variables of both pre-service and in-service
   teachers, revealing relevant gaps in knowledge and skills related to
   statistical and data literacy. Limited attention was given to teachers'
   affective variables. Research on the complex relationships between
   teacher variables, their teaching practices, and their students'
   learning is scarce, necessitating further investigation. Several
   pedagogical approaches to prepare STEM teachers for promoting
   statistical and data literacy in their classrooms were identified.
   Positive impacts on teachers' cognitive and affective variables were
   observed, but longitudinal effects and transfer to classroom practice
   require further inquiry. As curricula worldwide increasingly emphasize
   statistical and data literacy, this review underscores the necessity of
   enhancing teachers' competencies, advocates for tailored pedagogical
   approaches, and emphasizes the need for further research to shape
   effective instruction in K-12 STEM education.},

Abstract = {A tertiary course in Quantitative Reasoning (QR) has the potential to
   develop key practical and intellectual skills for citizenship, such as
   critical thinking, problem solving, quantitative literacy, and oral and
   written communication. In this article, we present research conducted on
   four instructors of such a QR course for students enrolled in a wide
   variety of nonscience degree programs at a university in the United
   States. The course used a student-inquiry approach to proportional
   reasoning, probability, statistical reasoning, and mathematical
   modeling. The findings are framed by a 5 C model of QR, which entails
   Critical thinking to link real-world Contexts to mathematical Concepts
   supported by student Collaboration and QR Competencies. The research
   addressed the questions of how university instructors support student
   development of the skills needed for critical citizenship and how this
   support relates to the 5 C model. We found that three of the four
   instructors viewed critical thinking as a central goal of the QR course
   and as supporting citizenship education. All four engaged students in
   tasks designed to develop a combination of skills associated
   citizenship, including critical thinking, self-questioning,
   collaboration, and communication. The discussion addresses such issues
   as the course's merits and challenges, student engagement, the relative
   importance of the five Cs, the importance of instructional autonomy, and
   recommendations for related professional development and future
   research.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to advance understading of teachers' and
   researchers' work, in particular its cultural specificities, from a
   resource perspective by exploring the issues and challenges faced during
   the translation of a theoretical framework, the Documentational Approach
   to Didactics (DAD), from Western (English and French) to East Asian
   languages (Chinese and Japanese). A basic assumption is that the
   challenges encountered while translating are driven by the cultural and
   linguistic differences that exist between the West and East. Adopting
   the perspective of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD), we
   frame the translation work as a transposition process of research
   praxeology (a model of the researchers' practices and knowledge) from a
   Western to an Eastern institution. We investigate this process to
   identify cultural elements at different levels (school, society,
   civilization, etc.) using the ATD framework. After translating a DAD
   article into Chinese and Japanese separately, we then worked
   collaboratively to identify similar or diverse translation issues and
   investigated their origins. Consequently, the results revealed a
   considerable difference between the West and East, and ample
   similarities between China and Japan, especially in terms of the
   researchers' work and its relationship with the teachers' work.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an interconnected framework, Ways of thinking in
   STEM-based Problem Solving, which addresses cognitive processes that
   facilitate learning, problem solving, and interdisciplinary concept
   development. The framework comprises critical thinking, incorporating
   critical mathematical modelling and philosophical inquiry, systems
   thinking, and design-based thinking, which collectively contribute to
   adaptive and innovative thinking. It is argued that the pinnacle of this
   framework is learning innovation, involving the generation of powerful
   disciplinary knowledge and thinking processes that can be applied to
   subsequent problem challenges. Consideration is first given to
   STEM-based problem solving with a focus on mathematics. Mathematical and
   STEM-based problems are viewed here as goal-directed, multifaceted
   experiences that (1) demand core, facilitative ways of thinking, (2)
   require the development of productive and adaptive ways to navigate
   complexity, (3) enable multiple approaches and practices, (4) recruit
   interdisciplinary solution processes, and (5) facilitate the growth of
   learning innovation. The nature, role, and contributions of each way of
   thinking in STEM-based problem solving and learning are then explored,
   with their interactions highlighted. Examples from classroom-based
   research are presented, together with teaching implications.},

Abstract = {Assessments, in particular high stakes assessments, impact the nature of
   teaching and learning. Given this, the goal of citizenship if seen as
   important needs to feature within high stakes school exit assessments
   rather than only as part of curriculum and assessment policy rhetoric.
   South Africa's Mathematical Literacy (ML) curriculum foregrounds
   critical democratic citizenship. We analyse the ML Grade 12 exit
   assessments from their start in 2008 to 2020 to understand the emphasis
   placed on critical citizenship and how this emphasis has shifted over
   time. The literature base links critical citizenship orientations with
   reasoning and reflecting questions, so we focused on examination
   questions in this category. Our findings show shifts away from critical
   citizenship related agendas towards foregrounding a life preparation
   orientation for the self-managing person. Linked with this shift, we
   note a move away from general societal contexts towards more
   personal/individual contexts and moves from almost entirely national
   contexts to inclusion of global contexts. We noted movement from more
   open-phrased questions towards closed `check figure calculated is
   valid'-type questions. Assessment memoranda suggest assessors view these
   questions as reasoning items, eroding the critical citizenship agenda.
   While increasing numbers of students are taking ML rather than
   Mathematics, average performance stands at around 40\%. This points to
   limited and diminishing access to mathematical reasoning and reflecting
   for critical democratic citizenship. The paper highlights ways in which
   analysis of examinations over time can provide a window into the
   presence or absence of the citizenship agenda in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {We examined the relationships between different aspects of mathematics
   engagement for 285 students in their first year of high school in the
   United States. Path Analyses were used to trace the relationships
   between students' self-reported prior motivation and appraisals of
   control and value of mathematics, perceptions of teacher support and
   peer support. These variables and observed teacher and peer support as
   coded from video by researchers, were examined as potentially impacting
   students' self-reported in-the moment affect and task-level control and
   value appraisals Our results showed three key contributions. First,
   significant paths corresponded to relationships predicted by Control
   Value Theory (CVT) across a particularly robust set of variables and
   over the course of their first semester in high school. Second, results
   added further nuance by considering the objects that students'
   in-the-moment emotions were directed toward, showing distinctions
   between positive and negative emotions directed at the mathematics task,
   students' teachers and peers, and selves. Third, results more closely
   considered the impact of both observed and perceived aspect of support
   from peers and teachers in the classroom, in both its academic and
   social forms. Implications are discussed for theory and practice.},

Abstract = {Mathematical concepts are regularly used in media reports concerning the
   Covid-19 pandemic. These include growth models, which attempt to explain
   or predict the effectiveness of interventions and developments, as well
   as the reproductive factor. Our contribution has the aim of showing that
   basic mental models about exponential growth are important for
   understanding media reports of Covid-19. Furthermore, we highlight how
   the coronavirus pandemic can be used as a context in mathematics
   classrooms to help students understand that they can and should question
   media reports on their own, using their mathematical knowledge.
   Therefore, we first present the role of mathematical modelling in
   achieving these goals in general. The same relevance applies to the
   necessary basic mental models of exponential growth. Following this
   description, based on three topics, namely, investigating the type of
   growth, questioning given course models, and determining exponential
   factors at different times, we show how the presented theoretical
   aspects manifest themselves in teaching examples when students are given
   the task of reflecting critically on existing media reports. Finally,
   the value of the three topics regarding the intended goals is discussed
   and conclusions concerning the possibilities and limits of their use in
   schools are drawn.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work is to show an educational path for
   combinatorics and graph theory that has the aim, on one hand, of helping
   students understand some discrete mathematics properties, and on the
   other, of developing modelling skills through a robust understanding. In
   particular, for the path proposed to middle-school students, we used a
   connection between k-permutations and colourings of graphs: we indicated
   a way to solve problems related to counting all the possible
   arrangements of given objects in a k-tuple under given constraints. We
   solve this kind of problem by associating a graph with the constraints
   related to the k-tuple and by using graphs' colourings, in which every
   colour is associated with one of the objects. The number of arrangements
   is given by finding the number of colourings through an algorithm called
   the Connection-Contraction Algorithm. The educational path is set within
   the Teaching for Robust Understanding framework and the goal, from the
   mathematical skills perspective, is to enhance modelling, passing from
   real situations (the fish problem in our experiment) to mathematical
   problems (the graph's colouring in our experiment) and vice versa
   through the use of technology (the Connection-Contraction Algorithm with
   yEd editor, in our experiment), by using an extended modelling cycle.
   The meetings with students were videotaped and some results of the
   experimentation are given.},

Abstract = {Mathematics teachers' teaching beliefs play an important role in
   instructional practices and students' achievement. In China,
   transmissive teaching beliefs were prevalent before 2001. Since then, a
   student-centered concept has been advocated in the national curriculum
   reform; however, few studies have assessed contemporary Chinese
   mathematics teachers' teaching beliefs during the 20 years since the
   reform. In the current study, we elucidated the teaching beliefs Chinese
   teachers hold and their effects on instructional practices and students'
   mathematics achievement. A total of 1463 mathematics teachers and 12,437
   students in grade 4 were recruited from Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and
   Zhejiang in Eastern China. Based on self-reported teaching beliefs using
   a short revised version of the Teacher Education and Development Study
   in Mathematics (TEDS-M), the study identified that contemporary Chinese
   teachers usually hold constructive teaching beliefs. In comparison,
   transmissive teaching beliefs showed significantly higher scores for
   teachers with more than 20 years of teaching experience. Moreover, male
   teachers and those with more teaching experience were more transmissive,
   but the effect of gender was small. The indirect effect of teachers'
   teaching beliefs on students' mathematics achievement through perceived
   constructive instructional practices was revealed using a multilevel
   structural equation model. This study illustrates the teaching beliefs
   of Chinese mathematics teachers and their effects, using evidence
   collected from a more general perspective.},

Abstract = {In this reflective methodological paper we focus on affordances and
   challenges of video data. We compare and analyze two research settings
   that use the latest video technology to capture classroom interactions
   in mathematics education, namely, The Social Unit of Learning (SUL)
   project of the University of Melbourne and the MathTrack project of the
   University of Helsinki. While using these two settings as examples, we
   have structured our reflections around themes pertinent to video
   research in general, namely, research methods, data management, and
   research ethics. SUL and MathTrack share an understanding of mathematics
   learning as social multimodal practice, and provide possibilities for
   zooming into the situational micro interactions that construct
   collaborative problem-solving learning. Both settings provide rich data
   for in-depth analyses of peer interactions and learning processes. The
   settings share special needs for technical support and data management,
   as well as attention to ethical aspects from the perspective of the
   participants' security and discretion. SUL data are especially suitable
   for investigating interactions on a broad scope, addressing how multiple
   interactional processes intertwine. MathTrack, on the other hand,
   enables exploration of participants' visual attention in detail and its
   role in learning. Both settings could provide tools for teachers'
   professional development by showing them aspects of classroom
   interactions that would otherwise remain hidden.},

Title = {Integration of mathematical creativity into everyday classes through

Abstract = {Divergent thinking (DT), which involves finding new possibilities and
   seeing the familiar from a new perspective, has been stressed in
   mathematical creativity education. However, convergent thinking (CT),
   which involves searching for a correct single answer, has been
   relatively understudied in relation to developing mathematical
   creativity. Moreover, how to relate the two thinking modes when
   facilitating mathematical creativity in daily teaching has rarely been
   studied. In this study, we propose a framework of dynamic interplay
   between DT and CT, which we call DT/CT dynamics, that characterizes the
   creative learning process in the classroom, and to provide an example we
   analyze research results from two classes from our 3-year longitudinal
   study with an experienced teacher, in order to demonstrate the
   framework. Findings indicate that there were significant differences
   between the two classes in how DT/CT dynamics worked with respect to
   three aspects, namely, authority distribution, micro-level transition,
   and macro-level goals. This paper provides a new integrative framework
   that combines extant work on the psychology of DT/CT with ongoing
   research in mathematics education, which offers a meaningful lens to
   capture the way mathematical creativity is pursued effectively in
   everyday mathematics classrooms. In particular, the study provides a
   reinterpretation of the theoretical perspectives of Tan and Sriraman
   (2017) on creativity and provides an analytical tool that enables an
   understanding of creative learning processes in everyday mathematics
   classrooms in relation to DT/CT dynamics.},

Abstract = {We examine teachers' reflections on incorporating digital instructional
   resources (DIRs) into their mathematics teaching. We analyze qualitative
   interviews with 39 elementary school teachers from four educational
   contexts: Belgium, Finland, Sweden, and the U.S., using a framework
   proposed by Pepin et al. (Int J Math Educ 46: 645-661, 2017) to consider
   opportunities for DIRs to shift elements of teaching and learning in
   potentially transformative ways. Teachers described three major domains
   of teaching practice where they used DIRs: (a) class instruction, (b)
   student practice, and (c) professional participation. We found that
   teachers readily used DIRs during class instruction and to support
   student practice, guided by their existing instructional goals, which
   were shaped in part by education structures in the context. Few teachers
   incorporated DIRs in ways that transformed typical learning spaces. We
   also found that DIRs impacted several aspects of teachers' professional
   practices, including professional learning and collaboration. In
   particular, participation in social media and resource sharing altered
   the nature of and ways teachers participated in their own professional
   learning. We assert that efforts to use DIRs to stimulate change need to
   begin with an understanding of teachers' current practices and use our
   findings to identify three potential levers that might support movement
   toward change.},

Abstract = {Implementation support strategies such as professional development (PD)
   are pivotal in guaranteeing the assistance that teachers need to enact
   mathematics teaching innovations and to secure lasting change. Within
   large-scale efforts an important issue for researchers is to understand
   how to design and put into effect these implementation support
   strategies. Although some work has been done to examine the challenges
   of implementing PD to advance the enactment of mathematics teaching
   innovations in new school settings, little is known about the multiple
   challenges novice facilitators face when providing PD for fellow
   teachers in their local districts and communities. In this paper we
   report on a 3-year long study that examined how a novice facilitator
   learned to deal with these challenges and become confident in his new
   role. Drawing on Graven's (Educational Studies in Mathematics 57(2),
   177-211, 2004) expanded model of learning, a case study and an
   interpretative approach are used to investigate a novice facilitator's
   process of becoming confident. The findings provide evidence that
   becoming confident is part of an ongoing process of learning through (1)

Abstract = {This paper is devoted to changes in the way in which mathematical
   assessment is conducted in Russia and Ukraine, the two largest states
   formed after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Previously, in the USSR,
   there existed two parallel systems of examinations, as follows: exit
   exams, which were taken by schoolchildren graduating from high schools,
   and which were conducted using the same texts across the entire
   territory of each Soviet republic; and entrance exams, which each
   college conducted independently (with the approval of the Ministry). In
   the new states, a gradual transition occurred to conducting so-called
   uniform exams, in which exit and entrance exams were combined. This
   change reflected society's quest for a fair and effective system, which
   could avoid corruption, unfairness toward different categories of
   students, and the like. In this paper, examinations are analyzed as an
   expression of society's influence on the teaching of mathematics.
   Consequently, the paper analyzes, on the one hand, the stages in the
   appearance and formation of examination procedures, the problems offered
   on exams, and the influence of exams on the teaching of mathematics; and
   on the other hand, the attitude toward exams in society, discussion of
   them in the press, and other general issues. A necessary space in the
   paper is allocated to background information, with a discussion of how
   exams were conducted in the USSR and of the general changes that have
   taken place in both countries.},

Abstract = {Teachers' confidence and facility with strategies that position and
   support students who are English learners (ELs) as active participants
   in middle grades mathematics classrooms are key to facilitating ELs'
   mathematics learning. The Visual Access to Mathematics (VAM) project
   developed and studied teacher professional development (PD) focused on
   linguistically-responsive teaching to facilitate ELs' mathematical
   problem solving and discourse. This study examines whether VAM PD has a
   positive impact on teachers' self-efficacy in supporting ELs in
   mathematics and how components of the PD may have influenced teacher
   outcomes. Results from a field test involving a cluster randomized trial
   of 101 teacher participants from 47 schools showed that VAM PD had a
   positive impact on participants' self-efficacy related to teaching ELs
   in mathematics, based on pre/post self-efficacy survey responses. An
   analysis of participants' written reflections suggests that supported
   implementation of language strategies with ELs in their mathematics
   teaching contexts was a key PD component that contributed to teacher
   self-efficacy outcomes. Findings offer implications for mathematics
   teacher PD and for facilitating ELs' learning in mathematics.},

Abstract = {In this study we examined three preservice elementary teachers' (PSTs)
   use of mathematics tasks with English learners (ELs) during a field
   experience. For each of the first three weeks of the field experience,
   the PSTs were provided tasks for which to plan a lesson for a one-on-one
   session with an EL. Drawing on Brown's (2009) notion of Pedagogical
   Design Capacity, we analyzed the PSTs' lesson plans, weekly interviews,
   and written reflections to identify the ways in which the PSTs' beliefs
   about, goals for, and experiences with the ELs impacted their use of the
   tasks. We were particularly interested in how the PSTs attended to the
   linguistic aspects of the tasks. We found that the PSTs' overarching
   beliefs about teaching drove their desire to remove potential barriers
   and that they attempted to reduce students' struggles by modifying the
   tasks that they were provided. The PSTs utilized a range of
   modifications, including replacing potentially unfamiliar words,
   changing contexts, and increasing the white space in the tasks. Though
   some of these strategies were successful in removing barriers, they did
   not always facilitate students' linguistic development. Implications
   include the need for teacher educators to disrupt PSTs' notions of
   effective teaching in the hopes their goals transition from removing
   barriers to providing scaffolds.},

Title = {Capturing teaching practices in language-responsive mathematics
   classrooms Extending the TRU framework ``teaching for robust
   understanding{''} to L-TRU},

Abstract = {Supporting language in mathematics classrooms requires both curriculum
   material that follows language-responsive design principles and teaching
   practices that enact these principles with high instructional quality.
   This paper presents the analytic framework L-TRU, which was developed to
   assess language-responsive teaching practices quantitatively. The L-TRU
   framework draws upon Schoenfeld's teaching for robust understanding
   (TRU) framework by adapting its five dimensions to language-responsive
   classrooms: Mathematical Richness, Cognitive Demand, Equitable Access,
   Agency, and Use of Student Contributions. It is extended by two further
   dimensions, namely, Discursive Demand and Connecting Registers. The
   adapted and extended L-TRU rating scheme was applied to 41
   video-recorded lessons of 26 teachers who all used the same
   language-responsive curriculum material on percentages. The qualitative
   insights gained from selected transcripts reveal that the dimensions
   indeed capture important distinctions in valid ways. The analysis of
   interrater reliability and correlations confirms that distinct
   dimensions are captured with reliability. The quantitative overview of
   the ratings of 497 episodes shows that in spite of the shared curriculum
   material, a large variety of instructional practices were enacted:
   Consistently high quality was found in the dimensions Cognitive Demand
   and Equitable Access and a medium quality in Connecting Registers. The
   dimensions Agency, Discursive Demand and Use of Contributions show the
   largest variance among teachers, with Discursive Demand separating most.
   These findings empirically substantiate an important research tool for
   quantitatively capturing teaching practices with respect to their
   general mathematics instruction quality and language-responsive quality.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on a group of mothers of immigrant origin as they
   engage in explorations and conversations about mathematics. We examine
   how bringing in tasks that draw on their children's school mathematics,
   and on the participants' knowledge and experiences, can inform us about
   their understanding of mathematics and provide opportunities to further
   enhance this understanding. Our analysis centers on two different types
   of mathematical tasks, both with rich potential for adult numeracy
   education. The first type of task engages the mothers in school
   mathematics through an exploration of addition and subtraction. In the
   second type of task, we look at mothers as adult learners working on two
   mathematical problem solving tasks, with different levels of connections
   to their everyday experiences. The findings point to a relationship
   between the type of context (everyday based versus school based) and the
   nature of the adult learners' mathematical sense making and engagement
   with the tasks. While there was some initial apprehension towards the
   school based tasks, the direct connection to what their children are
   learning was a strong motivator. The everyday based tasks bring up the
   potential tension between everyday mathematics and academic mathematics.
   The more the task connected to their everyday knowledge, the more the
   mothers drew on their experience to offer approaches that made sense
   from a practical point of view. We argue that these different types of
   tasks can complement each other in working with adult learners to
   enhance their numeracy skills.},

Abstract = {In the study presented, as we report in this paper, we describe our
   theoretical and practical consideration to engage first-year pre-service
   teachers in proving activities in the context of a transition-to-proof
   course. We investigated how students argued to verify a claim of
   elementary number theory on entering university and compared the results
   to their performance in the final examination of the course.
   Subsequently, we elaborate on the following results: On entering
   university, students do not seem to be capable of using algebraic
   variables as a heuristic to engage in reasoning. However, after learning
   about different kinds of proofs and the symbolic language of
   mathematics, students give evidence of starting to value mathematical
   language and of enhancing their proof competencies.},

Abstract = {The role of metacognitive postdiction accuracy and autonomous and
   controlled motivation in mathematics was explored in elementary school
   children (n=208) within two perspectives, related to sample
   characteristics. A first study was set up in a population-based cohort.
   A second study was set up with children with and without a documented
   mathematical disability. Both studies revealed a concurrent relation
   between the metacognitive postdiction skills of children and their
   mathematical accuracy and speed, leading to the practical recommendation
   that teachers should pay attention to the accuracy of self-judgments of
   children. In addition, controlled motivation was negatively related to
   the speed and accuracy in study 2. Children with mathematical learning
   disabilities (MLD) differed from peers without mathematical learning
   disabilities on postdiction accuracy and autonomous motivation. However,
   they did not differ significantly on controlled motivation, suggesting
   the importance of differentiating between controlled and autonomous
   motivation when analyzing motivation in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Various instruments for assessing metacognitive skills and strategy use
   exist. Off-line self-reports are questionnaires and interviews
   administered either before or after task performance, while on-line
   measures are gathered during task performance through thinking aloud or
   observation. Multi-method studies in reading have shown that off-line
   methods suffer from serious validity problems, whereas the validity of
   on-line methods is adequate. Little is known, however, about the
   validity of methods for assessing metacognition in mathematics. Five
   instruments were administered to 30 secondary-school students: two
   prospective questionnaires (MSLQ and ILS) before a mathematics task, two
   on-line methods (observation and thinking aloud) concurrent to the
   mathematics task, and a task-specific retrospective questionnaire after
   the mathematics task. Mathematics performance was assessed by a posttest
   and GPA. Results confirm that prospective questionnaires have poor
   convergent and predictive validity in mathematics. Although the
   retrospective questionnaire does slightly better than prospective
   questionnaires, the validity of both on-line methods stands out. It is
   concluded that on-line instruments should be preferred over off-line
   instruments for the assessment of metacognitive skillfulness in
   mathematics.},

Abstract = {While aggregate reasoning is a core aspect of statistical reasoning, its
   development is a key challenge in statistics education. In this study we
   examine how students' aggregate reasoning with samples and sampling
   (ARWSS) can emerge in the context of statistical modeling activities of
   real phenomena. We present a case study on the emergent ARWSS of two
   pairs of sixth graders (age 11-12) involved in statistical data analysis
   and informal inference utilizing TinkerPlots. The students' growing
   understandings of various statistical concepts is described and five
   perceptions the students expressed are identified. We discuss the
   contribution of modeling to these progressions followed by conclusions
   and limitations of these results. While idiosyncratic, the insights
   contribute to the understanding of students' aggregate reasoning with
   data and models, with regards to samples and sampling.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze mathematics lessons using the Classroom
   Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), a standardized observation protocol
   that suggests that high-quality lessons are distinguished by the tenor
   and frequency of classroom interactions. Because the CLASS focuses on
   interactions, rather than the specifics of content teaching, it can be
   used across content areas from language arts to mathematics. While many
   previous studies have used CLASS as a measure of instructional quality,
   to date, no work has examined the affordances and constraints of using
   the content-agnostic CLASS to examine instructional quality in
   mathematics lessons. Our close qualitative analysis of three lessons
   highlights the importance of including practices that cut across content
   areas in measurement of instructional quality in mathematics classrooms.
   In addition, this paper is the first to highlight aspects of instruction
   in mathematics classrooms that are obscured by the CLASS. Discussion
   highlights how a relational lens foregrounds particular instructional
   aspects and marginalizes others.},

Abstract = {The Mathematics Scan (M-Scan), a content-specific observational measure,
   was utilized to examine the extent to which standards-based mathematics
   teaching practices were present in three focal lessons. While previous
   studies have provided evidence of validity of the inferences drawn from
   M-Scan data, no prior work has investigated the affordances and
   limitations of the M-Scan in capturing standards-based mathematics
   teaching. We organize the affordances and limitations into three
   categories: the operationalization of the M-Scan, the organization of
   the M-Scan, and the M-Scan within the larger ecology of instruction. Our
   analysis indicates the M-Scan differentiates among lessons in their use
   of standards-based mathematics teaching practices by operationalizing
   the M-Scan dimensions at the lesson level, sometimes at the expense of
   capturing the peaks and valleys within a single lesson. Simultaneously,
   the analysis revealed how the application of the rubrics may be impacted
   by lesson transcripts. We discuss the theoretical organization of the
   M-Scan and its implications for researchers and practitioners applying
   the rubrics. Finally, we point to the affordances and limitations of the
   M-Scan within the larger ecology of instruction by considering
   curricular issues and two dimensions of instruction not highlighted by
   the M-Scan.},

Abstract = {This work deals with the role of social practice in the construction of
   models related to advanced mathematical knowledge; specifically, with
   the way an individual uses the notion of variation in different
   phenomena while predictive thinking is the underlying principle in the
   mathematical process. The mathematical modelling of successive variation
   in mathematics and science is addressed through the interpretation of
   graphs in two cases of different nature: the diagnosis of a cardiologist
   on the health of a patient (a non-deterministic phenomenon) and the
   arguments of high school students facing the task of filling containers
   (a deterministic phenomenon). An emerging theory in the field of
   mathematics education-the socio-epistemological theory-explains the
   problem of construction of mathematical knowledge. The constructs of
   this theory are elaborated with an empirical basis; and the legitimacy
   of all forms of knowledge is assumed, be this knowledge popular,
   technical or scientific, since all of them constitute human wisdom. (In
   contrast, other contemporary approaches examine only one of the forms of
   knowledge).},

Abstract = {In the present study, we ask whether and how online assessment can
   inform teaching about students' understanding of advanced concepts. Our
   main goal is to illustrate how we study design of tasks that support
   reliable online formative assessment by automatically analyzing the
   objects and relations that characterize the students' submissions. We
   aim to develop design principles for e-tasks that have the potential to
   support the creation of rich and varied response spaces that reflect
   convincingly the students' perceptions. We focus on studying the design
   principles of such an interactive rich task, and the representations and
   tools that support automatic real-time analysis of submitted answers,
   primarily in the form of free-hand sketches. Using a design research
   methodology, we describe a two-cycle study focusing on one e-task
   concerning tangency to the graph of a function. We characterize the
   mathematical attributes of examples constructed by students in an
   interactive environment. Checking the correctness of answers is only one
   of the functions of the STEP platform that we use. That platform can
   identify submissions that contain partial information (e.g., missing or
   misplaced tangency points), can categorize these answers, and allow the
   teacher to analyze them further. The reported analysis demonstrates how
   the design of the tasks and the characterization of mathematical
   attributes can help to expand our understanding of different ways of
   conceptualizing.},

Title = {Level, strength, and facet-specific self-efficacy in mathematics test

Abstract = {Students' self-efficacy expectations (SEE) in mathematics are associated
   with their engagement and learning experiences. Going beyond previous
   operationalisations of SEE we propose a new instrument that takes into
   account not only facet-specificity (expectations related to particular
   competences or skills) and strength (confidence of the expectations),
   but also level (perceived task difficulty) of these expectations as
   proposed by Bandura (Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, W. H.
   Freeman \& Co, New York, 1997; Self-efficacy beliefs of adolescents,
   Information Age Publishing, Greenwich, 2006). In particular, we included
   level-specific items referring to perceived difficulty on a subsequent
   national test in mathematics. In total 756 Norwegian grade 5, 8, and 9
   students completed the ``Self-Efficacy Gradations of Difficulty
   Questionnaire.{''} We fitted plausible multitrait-multimethod models
   using structural equation models. The best fitting model included three
   factors representing levels of perceived difficulty, and a-priori
   specified correlated uniquenesses representing four facets. The facets
   related to problem solving or students' self-regulation skills during
   the test in order to accomplish the following: (1) complete a certain
   number of problems, (2) solve tasks of a certain challenge, (3)
   concentrate, and (4) not give up for a certain amount of time. The
   results indicated that three correlated constructs representing levels
   of SEE are associated with scores on national tests in mathematics, and
   that the strongest association is between national test scores and
   medium level SEE. Taking level (difficulty) into account broadens our
   understanding of the self-efficacy construct, and allows investigation

Abstract = {This survey describes the structure of the field of research on
   curriculum resources in mathematics education in the period from 2018
   till 2023. Based on the procedures of a systematic review relevant
   literature was identified using Web of Science as a database. The
   included literature was analyzed and categorized according to the type
   of curriculum resource and the area of study. Seven areas of studies
   were identified: studies on the role of curriculum resources, content
   analysis, user studies, studies on the effects of curriculum resources,
   studies on curriculum resource design, curriculum resources as data, and
   reviews. The areas were further subdivided into different subcategories
   based on the research questions of the included papers. The findings
   show that research on mathematics textbooks is still predominant in the
   field. The most popular areas of research are content analysis, user
   studies, studies on design, and studies on effects. Emerging areas are
   research on students' use of curriculum resources and the employment of
   user data from digital curriculum resources as data basis in mathematics
   education research.},

Title = {Learning analytics in mathematics education: the case of feedback use in
   a digital classification task on reflective symmetry},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 3},
Abstract = {Learning Analytics is concerned with the use of data collected in
   educational settings to support learning processes. We take a Learning
   Analytics approach to study the use of immediate feedback in digital
   classification tasks in mathematics. Feedback serves as an opportunity
   for learning, however its mere existence does not guarantee its use and
   effectiveness, as what matters is how learners interact with it.
   Therefore, our research questions are focused on that interaction. The
   data consisted of 266 object movements for classifying polygons, and 524
   shape movements for classifying traffic signs, under the topic of
   symmetry. Participants included 29 elementary school students (9-12
   years old) from Israel and Germany. Analyzing students' success,
   feedback use, and the associations between them, we demonstrate how not
   acting upon feedback is negatively associated with success, and how this
   undesired behavior slightly reduces along the learning process.},

Abstract = {This article is aimed at educators concerned with curricular initiatives
   that foster STE(A)M projects in secondary education to promote
   mathematics competencies. Research has recently reported that these
   projects superficially address mathematics content, hampering the
   development of competencies the consensus deems necessary to prepare
   citizens for daily life. This study shows that learning goals may be
   achieved when teachers receive personalised training and sustained
   assistance in their project experiences. We examine how two Spanish
   teachers, with advisors' support, progress in exploiting mathematics
   competencies within the implementation of a single project each over a
   period of 3 years. Their evolution was not the result of minor
   recommendations but of continuous interactions with the advisors. These
   interactions intended to maintain a balance between teacher confidence
   and project enhancements, which required commitment and constancy. Four
   of the five competencies considered in the Spanish curriculum emerged
   powerfully after sustained refinement. The frequently mobilised
   competencies were intra-mathematics, representations, as well as
   collaborative work and positive identity, followed by modelling. The
   last of which was difficult to address, but when it was, the other three
   emerged more naturally. Computational thinking was poorly represented
   mainly because of the advisors' background and its recent incorporation
   into the reference curriculum. The teachers' progress was influenced by
   the advisor's academic background, pedagogical expertise, ability to
   transfer research outcomes into teaching, and experience supporting
   others.},

Abstract = {Numbers and languages are present around the world. While mathematics is
   deemed as universal, communities around the world have developed
   mathematical practices that align with their specific context and needs.
   Rooted in an Indigenous epistemological framework, this manuscript
   presents a dialogue among four co-researchers and teachers retelling
   their experiences teaching and learning Mesoamerican numbers in both
   monolingual (Spanish) and bilingual (Ixil and Spanish) contexts. With a
   strong desire to learn about and reconnect with the forces of Indigenous
   mathematical thought and language that move within the teaching and
   learning of these numbers, the authors collectively reflected on their
   ``tellings{''} of prior work. It is worthy of note that these
   reflections on teaching and learning processes of naming Mesoamerican
   numbers, their symbols, and numerical values help realize that these
   concepts are more fully animated when presented in contexts that are
   onto-epistemologically relevant.},

Abstract = {Explaining is a vital spontaneous process for human beings, as through
   explanations we make sense of the surrounding phenomena. While the role
   and structure of explanations have been explored in each science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) area, little is still
   known regarding what counts as a good explanation for a STEM problem.
   This study seeks to address this void by examining the nature of 82
   explanations of a STEM challenge produced by 9th grade students (years
   14-16) who participated in a learning sequence designed with an
   integrated STEM education perspective (I-STEM). We aim to find out which
   types of explanations are produced by 9th grade students when engaged in
   an I-STEM learning sequence, as a strategy to establish/identify the
   core features of a good I-STEM explanation. As a subsidiary aim, we
   intend to propose an analytical framework that enables the
   characterization and understanding of the students' explanations to an
   integrated STEM problem, based on the combination of a theoretical view
   on I-STEM explanations and the qualitative analysis of explanations
   produced by students. Results show that a majority of the students
   produced STEM explanations, either descriptive or relational, that
   failed to demonstrate knowledge or procedures from the four STEM areas.
   About a quarter of the solutions entailed I-STEM explanations, thus
   recognizing the role of knowledge or procedures of each area, concurring
   to obtain the solution, from the creation of the artefact to the
   understanding of the underlying law. We further propose a
   conceptualization of a good I-STEM explanation as involving the
   mobilization of conceptual knowledge and processes from all STEM areas
   in an explicit and intentional way to present the solution devised to
   the STEM challenge.},

Abstract = {This work studies mathematics word problems' use in a classroom of
   recent immigrants, or newcomers, to a United States public elementary
   school. I study how word problems foster the recontextualization of
   mathematical concepts in a lived reality experienced by newcomer
   students in their new cultural and educational setting. In this study's
   setting language plays a significant role in the process of
   meaning-making. I describe how language use in word problems remains
   intertwined with mathematics instruction. This opens a space for
   questioning word problems' purpose and role in multilingual classrooms,
   and I highlight how the creative process of co-constructing problems'
   meaning in this context can expand notions of genre applied to word
   problems. Throughout I adopt a theorization of translanguaging as a
   language practice and apply it in problem discussion. This helps probe
   how language use impacts students' ways of understanding and utilizing
   mathematical concepts.},

   technology in education, particularly prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
   and teachers' insufficient experience with online or hybrid learning and
   teaching approaches resulted in several countries being unprepared for
   education during the pandemic. The flipped classroom (FC) is an
   innovative pedagogy with the potential to engage students in mathematics
   education using hybrid education combined with online and face-to-face
   learning, which is especially important during a pandemic. However,
   despite the high expectations surrounding this innovative approach, to
   date, no systematic literature review has discussed the opportunities
   and pitfalls of FCs in mathematics education regarding pandemic-related
   issues. In the present systematic review, we aim to bridge this gap and
   highlight the importance of flipping mathematics instruction during the
   pandemic and beyond. The results, which are based on textual analysis of
   97 eligible articles, demonstrate that FC is a promising pedagogy that
   has numerous benefits for mathematics teaching and learning, although it
   is not a panacea for pandemic-related issues, as it also has several
   significant pitfalls. Overall, if the mechanism of mathematics education
   is to be crisis-ready, we should learn from experiences during the
   pandemic. In this regard, the current review contributes to research in
   mathematics education with the aim of gaining insight into successful
   implementations of FC pedagogy, not only during the pandemic but also
   beyond the crisis era of a pandemic.},

Abstract = {The International Mathematical Olympiad, now 62 years old, has catalyzed
   the formation of a remarkable international community that meets for 2
   weeks each year to celebrate mathematical problem solving. It has
   influenced and expanded the greater global mathematical culture, and the
   value of problem-solving in numerous countries. It is time for the
   mathematics competition community to reach out and pose questions for
   serious inquiry. What is the extent of this influence? What are its
   effects? Reciprocally, what effects have different mathematical
   traditions had on the IMO? Some significant studies have been done to
   answer such questions, but several remain unanswered, and most remain
   unposed. We survey the work that has been done, then some anecdotal
   evidence, including case studies of the participation of individual
   countries in the IMO. We then suggest some topics needing a deeper
   inquiry. The intention of this article is to invite the research
   community to work with the IMO community in a serious investigation of
   the half-century of experience afforded us by the IMO.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present a theoretical discussion on how problems issued
   from discrete mathematics can develop the attitudes, skills, and
   knowledge required for scientific mathematical activity in the
   classroom. We do so via the research situation for the classroom model
   by performing mathematical and didactical analyses of a problem issued
   from discrete geometry, and we present the results of a preliminary
   experiment conducted with Chilean students between the ages of 11 and
   13. Our chosen problem asked students to tile a fixed square with a
   finite number of smaller squares. From the theoretical analysis and the
   preliminary experimentation, we conclude that this problem, and problems
   issued from discrete mathematics in general, can induce genuine
   mathematical activity in lower-secondary school students. In particular,
   we conclude that this problem is effective in developing the knowledge,
   skills and attitudes advocated in the Chilean mathematics curriculum.},

Abstract = {In this paper we describe how a teacher makes decisions during
   interaction with students in order to guide their focus towards the
   lesson's objectives that the teacher has in mind. In particular, in the
   paper we examine how a mathematics teacher's knowledge connects with the
   teacher's noticing skill and interactive action. We present the case of
   a competent Japanese teacher, Mr. T, during a series of nine lessons on
   comparing fractions in a fifth-grade classroom. We first look at how Mr.
   T structured the lessons and interactions to help the students shift
   their focus from the procedural aspects to the quantitative aspects,
   when generating their explanations concerning how to compare fractions.
   Then, we analyze how Mr. T interpreted the students' responses and made
   decisions about his interactive actions in the two lessons. The results
   show that Mr. T structured the entire lessons by repeatedly eliciting
   students' ideas and focusing on the object of examination. Detailed
   analysis of three vignettes shows Mr. T's constant reference to the
   lesson objectives when attending to and interpreting the students'
   thinking both in verbal and written form. Furthermore, he strove to
   adjust his initial decisions according to the students' reactions. These
   processes of noticing the students' mathematical thinking were made
   possible by his extensive content knowledge and pedagogical content
   knowledge; in particular, his knowledge of figural representation had a
   significant influence on his decision-making.},

Abstract = {The World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions (WFNMC) was
   founded in 1984 as a professional organization that provides the
   possibility of international collaboration among mathematicians and
   mathematics educators working in the area of mathematics contests. Over
   the last decades the field, which has come to be called ``competition
   mathematics for school students{''}, has developed new methods for two
   important activities in mathematics education, namely, problem posing
   and problem solving. Because of this development, competition
   mathematics has shaped itself into a separate branch of mathematics
   education with its particular features, trends and needs. It not only
   contains the seeds of many fields of contemporary mathematics, but has
   also stimulated rich contributions to important research areas of
   mathematics education, in the intersection of the interests of both
   professional communities. Mathematics competitions serve also to
   identify mathematical talent worldwide and to promote the attraction of
   young people of higher ability to professional careers in mathematics.
   In many cases, problems posed in mathematical contests inspire
   mathematical research and new methods of teaching mathematician. In this
   paper I briefly describe the history of WFNMC. I focus on the main
   activities of the Federation, including conferences, awards,
   publications, and research areas of the members. As the only
   international professional organization in this field, the WFNMC
   supports activities that have their own particular significance, which
   are discussed in the paper.},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to show whether the systems of mathematics
   teacher education in two countries whose historical development may seem
   quite similar (the Czech Republic and Hungary were parts of the Habsburg
   Monarchy, and they were part of the Eastern European communist block)
   are also very similar, or whether each country follows its own, unique
   path. In this paper we build on the general need for more international
   comparative studies in the area of teacher education. We present a
   historical review of development of mathematics teacher education in
   both countries and analyse and compare current teacher education
   programs, their structure and organization, the demands on mathematics
   teachers and their qualifications for teaching at various levels. In the
   paper we pinpoint a number of aspects resulting in differences in the
   two systems, including historical development and traditions,
   (de)-centralization, globalization and international cooperation, etc.
   The comparison based on these aspects shows that the systems in both
   countries are very different. The analysis described in this paper could
   become the starting point for further research using the data from
   international surveys (e.g. PISA). Such research would enable us to make
   conjectures about the effects of various ways of organizing teacher
   education.},

Abstract = {The educational literature often includes debate over the nature and
   nurture of mathematical giftedness. The varied schools of thought
   reflect discrepancies between views, which are to a large extent
   functions of philosophical, political, and economic considerations. To
   address this debate, in the context of the current ZDM Special Issue, I
   attempt to analyze research and practices linked to mathematical
   giftedness in the Soviet Union in 1960-1980. I also look at the
   continuation of these Soviet-era practices, and to their influence on
   practices internationally. Particular attention is paid to the
   literature devoted to reaching a deeper understanding of the phenomenon
   of mathematical giftedness and of ways of nurturing this giftedness. The
   analysis starts with the discussion of domain-specific and
   domain-general characteristics of mathematical giftedness that have to
   be taken into account in educational environments for the mathematically
   gifted. It continues with a review of practices in special mathematical
   schools and classes in the Soviet Union, and a comparison to similar
   settings around the world in the twenty-first century. There is also an
   overview of enrichment mathematical activities, with a focus on
   mathematical circles, mathematical competitions and Olympiads,
   accompanied by a description of specificities of the mathematical
   content employed for the promotion of mathematical giftedness. Finally,
   the paper focuses on the question of what characterizes an excellent
   teacher of mathematically gifted students and on new educational
   technologies that are changing the education of these students
   worldwide. Following this analysis, I suggest some open questions for
   future research on the education of mathematically gifted students.},

Abstract = {Curriculum reform brings new approaches to classroom practice. As
   changes to the curriculum are implemented, teachers need to receive
   additional support from textbooks and other materials. In the study
   presented in this paper, we explored the use of resources during the
   process of educational reform in Croatia. The focus was on the use of a
   mathematics textbook set as the main resource, but the use of other
   material and non-material resources was also examined. The study also
   dealt with the social factors that influenced the use of these
   resources. It was designed as a case study of one mathematics teacher
   and her students, examined at three time points, before the reform, in
   the preparation period, and subsequent to the implementation of the
   reform. The results showed that the textbook set is a stable resource
   over the time periods, although it did undergo some changes towards
   digitalization. The teacher's professional development was shown to be
   an important non-material resource during the period of change. The
   research also revealed that the participants' decisions concerning the
   use of resources depended on some social issues, such as norms concerned
   with being a teacher or a student. The study showed that longitudinal
   monitoring of the use of resources in the period of curricular change
   may contribute to a better understanding of the processes of
   instructional transformation and development.},

Abstract = {After four decades of research and development on language in
   mathematics classrooms, there is consensus that enhancing language is
   crucial for promoting students' mathematics learning. After briefly
   sketching the theoretical contexts for work on this topic, in this paper
   we present six design principles for instruction that enhances language
   for mathematics learning. We then review the research that provides an
   empirical foundation for these principles, (a) concerning the design of
   learning environments to enhance language for mathematics learning and
   (b) on teaching practices (including teacher moves and classroom norms)
   involved in the enactment of those designed learning environments.
   Without claiming completeness, this review of the state of development
   and research shows that some aspects of design and instruction that
   enhance language for mathematics learning have been well researched,
   whereas research gaps for other aspects persist.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to narrate a significant part of the experience
   of a professor over several semesters teaching fundamental ideas of the
   Theory of Calculus. The narrative explains how his didactic and
   mathematical mentality evolved as he witnessed students' conceptual
   difficulties, as they were confronted with situations that generated
   tensions between their intuitions and the formal rigor of the theory of
   calculus. The evolving atmospheres in the classroom, the efforts to
   teach, and the deep obstacles to learning, indicate the existence of an
   epistemic fissure as one leaves the dynamic and geometric way of
   thinking and tries to adopt a mode of thinking developed from
   arithmetical rigor and the presence of infinity.},

Abstract = {This paper builds on a range of traditions in educational research and
   design to argue, with empirical evidence, that constructing powerful
   instructional materials and approaches that work at scale requires a
   grounding in theory and a commitment to engineering practice, including
   rapid prototyping and multiple development cycles. Specifically, we
   claim that improving practice within a reasonable timescale requires
   replicable materials that integrate: (1) grounding in robust aspects of
   theory from prior research, (2) design tactics that combine these core
   ideas with a design team's creativity, along with (3) flexibility in the
   draft materials that affords adaptation across contexts, (4) rapid
   prototyping, followed by iterative refinement cycles in increasingly
   realistic circumstances, with (5) feedback from each round of trials
   that is rich and detailed enough to inform revision, and (6) continued
   refinement on the basis of post-implementation feedback `from the
   field'. Examples of successful implementation are analysed and related
   to the various roles that research-based theory and programmatic
   research-based methods of development can and should play in the complex
   process of turning insights from research into improvements in practice.
   In contrast, we shall argue that materials which are written and
   published without the development processes (4) to (6)-still the great
   majority-lack research validity for use at scale.},

Abstract = {Classroom research into mathematics and language has studied issues of
   context specificity such as cultures of explanation or the impact of
   language policies on practice. More recently, researchers in the domain
   have started to study issues of content specificity aimed at performing
   language-responsive mathematics teaching for the learning of precise
   mathematical content. Progress in the conceptualization of language as
   resource for mathematics teaching and learning makes it necessary to
   strengthen the discussion of the contexts of culture and interaction
   along with the linguistic demands given by the specificity of the
   mathematical content at play. In this paper, I introduce a sociocultural
   framing for a mathematical-linguistic view of grammar as resource with
   the focus on explicitness in communication. I then report developmental
   work with two teachers on their teaching of algebraic concepts, and
   address the question of how to learn to communicate explicit meanings
   for these concepts in classroom mathematical talk. The structuring
   principle adopted for this work was to critically distinguish and choose
   or produce instances of teacher talk that overtly communicated
   conceptual meaning within the algebra of equations. I conclude with
   preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the work with the teachers.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies shape the processes of teaching and learning in the
   classroom. They create spaces for action, while at the same time they
   pose restrictions and can generate unexpected situations, both for
   teachers and students. In this paper, we show examples in which teachers
   respond to contingencies emerging from the use of interactive programs
   in the classrooms. By describing different ways in which teachers react
   to those contingencies, we show how the technology plays an important
   role, at times by creating unexpected situations, and at others in
   support of teachers' explanations. In both cases it can promote
   modifications in students' actions and shape teachers' actions and
   responses in relation to a particular mathematical situation or problem.
   Understanding how teachers react when they are faced with an unexpected
   situation is important in order to gain knowledge about those particular
   responses that result in effective behaviors that are related to
   mathematics learning, and also in terms of the construction of rich
   learning environments that promote those kinds of behaviors. Results
   show that the kind of interaction that technology has the potential for
   promoting plays an important role in making students and teachers more
   aware of students' doubts and misunderstandings, but that this potential
   needs to be accompanied by effective teachers' strategies through which
   they use contingencies as opportunities to promote both their own and
   their students' learning. This study contributes to deepening knowledge
   about teachers' effective strategies in primary school classrooms as
   well as providing examples to promote reflection regarding teachers'
   training programs.},

Abstract = {Solving systems of linear equations is of central importance in linear
   algebra and many related applications, yet there is limited literature
   examining the symbolizing processes students use as they work to solve
   systems of linear equations. In this paper, we examine this issue by
   analyzing final exam data from 68 students in an introductory
   undergraduate linear algebra course at a large public research
   university in the United States. Based on our analysis, we expanded our
   framework (Larson \& Zandieh, 2013) for interpretations of matrix
   equations to include augmented matrices and symbolic forms commonly used
   in solving linear systems. We document considerable variation in
   students' symbolization processes, which broadly occurred along two
   primary trajectories: systems trajectories and row reduction
   trajectories. Row reduction trajectories included at least five symbolic
   shifts, two of which students executed with a great deal of success and
   uniformity. Students' symbolizing processes varied more in relation to
   the other three shifts, and these variations were often linked to trends
   of variable renaming, variable creation, or imagined parameter
   reasoning. Students were more flexible in their solution strategies when
   solving systems involving lines than for systems involving planes.},

Abstract = {The academic field of Disability Studies (DS) offers theoretical tools
   to understand how social practices intersect with embodiment, long a
   critical issue in DS because disability is a category of human
   difference that is always already embodied. I review two theories that
   seek to resolve this dichotomy between the body and social worlds:
   complex embodiment (Siebers, Disability theory, University of Michigan
   Press, Ann Arbor, 2008) and the political/relational model (Kafer,
   Feminist, Queer, Crip, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 2013). I
   use these theories to analyze ethnographic data and narratives of a
   Latina named Desi around disability and mathematics. Desi's narratives
   explored experiences relating to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
   Disorder, Learning Disabilities, and mathematics anxiety. Desi's
   narratives described disabilities as socio-political constructs,
   involving relations of power and exclusion, as well as acknowledging the
   physiological, embodied experience of some differences in relation to
   mathematics. Through this analysis, I argue for the inclusion of emotion
   in embodiment, and the use of narrative analysis paired with ethnography
   as a tool to understand embodied experience.},

Abstract = {Publicly-available datasets, though useful for education, are often
   constructed for purposes that are quite different from students' own. To
   investigate and model phenomena, then, students must learn how to
   repurpose the data. This paper reports on an emerging line of research
   that builds on work in data modeling, exploratory data analysis, and
   storytelling to examine and support students' data repurposing. We ask:
   What opportunities emerge for students to reason about the relationship
   between data, context, and uncertainty when they repurpose public data
   to explore questions about their local communities? And, How can these
   opportunities be supported in classroom instruction and activity design?
   In two exploratory studies, students were asked to pose questions about
   their communities, use publicly-available data to investigate those
   questions, and create visual displays and written stories about their
   findings. Across both enactments, opportunities for reasoning emerged
   especially when students worked to reconcile (1) their own knowledge and
   experiences of the context from which data were collected with details
   of the data provided; and (2) their different emerging stories about the
   data with one another. We review how these opportunities unfolded within
   each enactment at the level of group and classroom, with attention to
   facilitator support.},

Abstract = {As a component of the ongoing development of the mathematics curriculum
   in China, we compare the country's high school mathematics textbooks
   with those of several other countries. We base our analysis on the
   assumption that textbooks, as primary printed teaching resources, are
   key tools for interpreting educational policy. In this paper, we compare
   what content is selected and how that content is presented in series of
   high school textbooks from China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, the
   United Kingdom, and the United States according to four core domains:
   algebra, geometry, statistics and probability, and calculus. We then
   discuss the implications of the analysis for the reform of the high
   school mathematics curriculum in China, particularly as it applies to
   the development of textbooks within that process of reform. The
   comparative results provide us with the opportunity to recognise the
   distinguishing features of the content and presentation of the Chinese
   mathematics curriculum and lead to some suggestions for future
   curriculum development.},

Abstract = {The ability to offer constructive feedback to students concerning their
   errors is an indispensable requirement for mathematics teachers, for the
   purpose of providing cognitively challenging learning opportunities.
   However, if they are to react adequately, teachers need to identify
   student errors immediately. The fast perception of student errors can
   therefore be described as an indispensable part of mathematics teachers'
   professional competence. Data on this facet of teacher competence were
   gathered as part of a national follow-up-study of the IEA's
   international TEDS-M (Teacher Education and Development Study in
   Mathematics) that used a time-limited test to measure teachers'
   perception of student errors. This paper aims to provide evidence for
   the validity of the test interpretation of fast student-error perception
   as an indicator of professional competence by drawing on contrast groups
   already used in other studies. Overall, the study could support the
   validity of the test interpretation because the chosen contrast groups
   were found to perform either better than the tested teachers-as is the
   case for the contrast group of mathematicians-or more poorly, as is the
   case for the group of students. Furthermore, the present study shows
   that the competence facet of fast student error perception is closer to
   the domain of teachers' mathematical content knowledge than it is to the
   domain of teachers' mathematics pedagogical content knowledge.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted during the first semester of 2016, from March
   21st to June 30th, with 104 students, in eight educational centers or
   polos, in the states of Minas Gerais and So Paulo. Previously, these
   mathematics teacher education students had no opportunity to study in
   higher education in Brazil. They were enrolled in a Mathematical
   Modelling course, as part of the Universidade Aberta do Brasil (UAB),
   which is the Brazilian open university, at the Universidade Federal de
   Ouro Preto (UFOP). All stages of this study were performed in accordance
   with case study methodological procedures, which covered data collection
   and analysis. The interpretation of the results was accomplished through
   the development of categories, which emerged from collected qualitative
   data at the completion of the fieldwork. These procedures helped the
   researchers to answer the research question: How can technological
   resources available in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) help
   students to interact and collaboratively develop mathematical modelling
   projects that assist them in solving problems they face in daily life?
   One important claim for mathematical modelling in a VLE is to favor the
   development of students in their interaction and collaboration in
   solving problems they face daily, by elaborating modelling projects
   through the use of technological resources available in this
   environment. By developing these projects, students learned to
   problematize, contextualize, and investigate problems. As well, they
   prepared questions that aimed to seek, collect, select, organize, and
   handle the information that allowed them to reflect critically about the
   role of mathematics in their own context. The results from this study
   show that the development of modelling projects in a VLE helped students
   to interact and collaboratively inquire and investigate their chosen
   theme in accordance with their own interests and reality.},

Abstract = {Context personalization is an instructional design principle where tasks
   are presented to students in the context of their interest areas like
   sports, music, or video games. Personalization allows for understanding
   of domain principles to be grounded in concrete and familiar
   experiences. By making connections to prior knowledge, personalization
   may reduce extraneous cognitive load, freeing up resources for the
   acquisition of new ideas. However, issues with adding seductive details
   that may distract learners, as well as mismatch between in-school and
   out-of-school mathematics, must be critically considered when designing
   for personalized learning. We review the research on personalization in
   mathematics, interpreting conflicting results by highlighting key
   cognitive considerations. Personalization can be implemented at
   radically different levels of depth, grain size, and ownership. We give
   an extended example of a promising intervention for personalized
   learning, drawing from research on problem-posing in algebra. We argue
   that interventions designed to draw upon students' experiences with
   quantities have potential to enhance learning. However, when the
   complex, situated experiences of students are mathematized, there is a
   tension between preserving the authenticity of their experience, and
   accomplishing desired mathematical goals.},

Title = {Learning more about derivative: leveraging online resources for varied
   realizations},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 28},
Abstract = {Recent literature underlines the increasing use of online platforms in
   learning undergraduate mathematics, where students refer to these as
   supplementary resources to develop their mathematical understanding.
   Through an intrinsic case study, we focus on a highly viewed YouTube
   learning resource for learning derivative. The selected case is from
   3Blue1Brown, a YouTube channel whose founder has received an award from
   the American Mathematical Society. The video has garnered more than 3.3
   million views in the past couple of years. Reflecting on the relevant
   literature, a realization tree for derivative is developed and then used
   as an analytical tool to analyze this resource to explore what
   realizations have been used in it to facilitate students' understanding
   of derivative. The findings indicate that the analyzed YouTube resource
   discusses various realizations of derivative, including all its five
   main realizations, and effectively utilizes new digital technology for
   discussing these realizations. Such an exceptional resource for learning
   mathematics leads us to suggest that mathematics lecturers raise their
   awareness about such online free resources and incorporate them into
   their teaching packages when appropriate to facilitate student learning.},

Title = {Teacher noticing in mathematics education: a review of recent
   developments},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 21},
Abstract = {The teacher noticing construct is widely recognized in teacher
   competence and education research, particularly in the field of
   mathematics education. This paper surveys recent research on mathematics
   teacher noticing published between July 2019 and 2022, following an
   earlier literature review on teacher noticing across different
   disciplines. The study presented here analyzed 118 English-language
   articles published in peer-reviewed journals, focusing on
   conceptualizations, research methods, and relationships with other
   constructs, including teacher knowledge and beliefs. The findings
   suggest that the cognitive-psychological perspective on noticing, which
   emphasizes a set of cognitive processes, remains the predominant
   conceptualization. Recent research on noticing is characterized by a
   high proportion of studies based on small samples and qualitative
   research methods. While several studies have demonstrated the
   interrelatedness of noticing and professional knowledge, the
   relationship between noticing and beliefs and between noticing and
   instructional quality has rarely been addressed. Based on these
   findings, we highlight noteworthy contributions and critical
   shortcomings, and suggest directions for future research.},

Title = {Facing and challenging language ideologies towards a more inclusive
   understanding of language in mathematics education research-the case of
   sign languages},

Abstract = {Research on language in mathematics education is largely dominated by a
   `normalcy' of spoken languages. This modal hegemony does not only affect
   a whole group of learners in failing to provide access that is
   epistemologically equitable-those using sign language as their preferred
   mode for mathematical discourse-it also obscures our view on the roles
   language can play in mathematical thinking and learning. As a field, we
   can only win from seeking to understand Deaf learners of mathematics
   beyond a disability, as learners of mathematics with a specific
   linguistic background that influences mathematical thinking and learning
   in peculiar ways. In this contribution, I suggest a shift in mindset
   towards a more inclusive view on language in mathematics education
   research and practice. I propose basic principles to inform a
   perspective for reconsidering the role of language in mathematics
   thinking and learning, inspired by work of philosopher Francois Jullien.
   This perspective counters a perspective that merely integrates sign
   language into existing research and instead searches for dialogue
   between linguistic modalities in learning mathematics, looking beyond
   language as spoken or written. This approach will be illustrated by the
   case of the modal affordance of iconicity foregrounded in signed
   mathematical discourse, its role in Deaf students' mathematics thinking
   and learning, and how this can inform existing research and practice
   dealing with language in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Advocacy of STEM curricular approaches is based on a concern to engage
   students in authentic disciplinary and interdisciplinary practices in
   the STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) disciplines,
   and the need to promote participation in STEM pathways. The STEM Academy
   professional learning program was developed to support teachers to
   engage and motivate students by creating real-world, challenging
   problems. The initiative involved interdisciplinary teams of secondary
   STEM teachers attending workshops and working with university experts to
   design, implement and evaluate STEM curricular experiences. This paper
   focuses on case studies undertaken in two of the twelve schools involved
   in the initiative, using interview data from teachers and students, to
   explore the nature of their programs and their experiences. We
   investigate key features of these two schools' approaches, using a
   conceptual framework for integrated STEM, and explore the challenges and
   benefits of different features of integrated STEM that promote different
   dimensions of engagement in learning mathematics. We explore how the
   framework characteristics can be reframed into four dimensions that
   promote mathematics engagement in integrated STEM education - design
   thinking in authentic contexts, content integration, STEM practices and
   21st Century skills, and exposure to professional practice.},

Abstract = {Intending to counteract Klein's second discontinuity in teacher
   education, we explored and applied the innovation of ``interface
   ePortfolio{''} in the context of a geometry course for preservice
   teachers (PSTs). The tool offers the possibility of implementing the
   design principle of profession orientation. In the article, we
   theoretically clarify what we understand by this principle and locate
   our innovative concept against this theoretical background. We
   empirically investigate the extent to which counteraction against the
   second discontinuity is successful by analyzing reflection texts created
   in the interface ePortfolio, focusing on PSTs' perspectives. Our
   qualitative content analysis shows that most of them perceive the
   innovation as helpful in the intended sense and indicates that the
   course concept, in general, and the interface ePortfolio, in particular,
   have helped establish relevant links between the course content and
   their later work as teachers.},

Abstract = {Proofs as epistemic tools are central to mathematical practice, as they
   establish and provide explanations for the validity of mathematical
   statements. Considering the challenge that proof construction poses to
   learners of all ages, prior research has investigated its cognitive
   determinants, but the impact of affective-motivational experiences on
   proof construction has been insufficiently investigated. Emotions
   related to knowledge acquisition (i.e., epistemic emotions) are assumed
   to play a key role in epistemic processes. In this study we investigated
   how the performance of 80 mathematics undergraduate students in a
   geometric proof construction task relates to the epistemic emotions
   experienced during proof construction. Controlling for geometry
   knowledge, we included control and value appraisals as antecedents in
   our investigation of epistemic emotions, and attention and motivation as
   mediators of their effects on proof construction performance. The
   results indicate that positive as well as negative emotions are
   influenced by students' appraisals, also indicating an interaction of
   both appraisal dimensions. Primarily enjoyment and curiosity mediate the
   effects of these appraisals on attention and motivation. These two
   markers of the proof construction process, in turn, mediate the effects
   of enjoyment and boredom on proof construction performance. In this
   study we investigated systematically the role of epistemic emotions in
   geometric proof construction and we offer insights that complement the
   existing research on the cognitive determinants of proof performance.
   Moreover, this study extended research on epistemic emotions into the
   area of proof construction, an epistemic process central to mathematics.},

Abstract = {Research literature on the role of mathematics teachers during the
   COVID-19 crisis shows that teacher preparation for emergency situations
   is required. In reporting on this exploratory study, we present and
   analyse lesson plans created by seven future teachers for mathematics
   classes during the pandemic. Data were collected between April and
   October 2021 from 16 four-hour class sessions in a Mathematics Degree
   Program at a public university in Medellin, Colombia. The notion of
   Humans-with-Media and the Learning by Expanding theory were used as
   frameworks to understand what roles prospective mathematics teacher
   (PMTs) assign to technologies for teaching in pandemic conditions. The
   PMTs' uses of technology for teaching mathematics during a pandemic were
   categorized. The results show that technology was used to reorganize and
   reproduce mathematics teaching practices. This report addresses the
   impact of technology on the activity system, and we conclude with a
   discussion of opportunities and limitations of students' conceptions
   about teaching and technology during a pandemic.},

Abstract = {Given the significance of functional thinking as one of the main routes
   to foster early algebraic thinking, in this paper we describe how a
   current elementary mathematics textbook's unit titled ``Pattern and
   Correspondence{''} was developed in the Korean context. The following
   four key instructional elements for fostering functional thinking were
   extracted from the literature review: (a) correspondence relationships
   in real-life contexts; (b) various pattern tasks; (c) exploration for a
   correspondence relationship; and (d) symbol variables to represent a
   correspondence relationship. These elements were employed to analyze the
   strengths and weaknesses of the unit covering pattern and correspondence
   in the previous mathematics textbook. Based on this analysis, a new
   draft for the pattern and correspondence unit was designed and
   implemented in an elementary school to test its appropriateness and
   ability to enhance students' functional thinking. Students' responses
   using the new draft were analyzed in terms of the four elements.
   Performance between the students with the new draft and their
   counterparts with the previous textbook was compared. The students with
   the new draft were more successful than their counterparts in exploring
   and representing the relationship between two quantities. The final
   version of the unit was developed and has been applied to all schools.
   The whole process of developing the unit can be an example of how to
   foster functional thinking through changes to curricular resources.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we provide an overall perspective on the teaching and
   learning of discrete mathematics. Our aim is to highlight what research
   has been conducted in this area and to connect it to existing research
   ideas for future work. We begin by characterizing discrete mathematics
   and its role in the school curriculum, highlighting themes, topics, and
   mathematical practices that distinguish discrete mathematics. We then
   present potential benefits of focusing on discrete mathematics topics
   for mathematics education; in particular, we discuss the accessibility
   of topics in discrete mathematics, the connection to mathematical
   processes and affect, and the relevance of discrete mathematics in our
   current society. We also emphasize discrete mathematics from an
   international perspective, highlighting studies from the US, Italy,
   France, Chile, and Germany, which are across all school levels-primary,
   middle, and secondary school, and with some implications for
   post-secondary education. We particularly discuss discrete topics
   including number theory, combinatorics, iteration and recursion, graph
   theory, and discrete games and puzzles; we describe and situate these
   topics within literature. We also suggest the additional topics of game
   theory and the mathematics of fairness that we hope to see addressed in
   future studies.},

Abstract = {It is commonly known that the letter M in the two acronyms HPM and STEM
   stands for mathematics, and it is natural to regard mathematics as
   playing a significant role in science education. However, it seems that
   appropriate attention is not usually accorded to the role of M in the
   area of STEM where mathematics tends to be marginalized. In fact,
   throughout history one witnesses STEM at work so that the discussion of
   HPM and STEM in parallel will be beneficial to both. In both the
   historical and pedagogical aspects, it may be worthwhile to note that
   history of mathematics affords some means to mirror several different
   mathematical worlds in the context of HPM in a pluralistic way in order
   to offer a fuller view of the subject. In this paper I examine this
   issue through sampling many examples gleaned from the history of
   mathematics, particularly the role of M in the world of science and
   technology.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was firstly to investigate the mathematical
   metacognitive characteristics of high-efficiency students by comparing
   high-efficiency and low-efficiency students. Secondly, the aim was to
   explore the pathways of mathematical metacognition of efficient
   mathematics learners in mathematics achievement. In this study,
   second-year Chinese middle school students were divided into a
   high-efficiency group (n = 297) and a low-efficiency group (n = 203)
   according to their learning efficiency in mathematics. The results
   indicated that the mathematical metacognitive knowledge and mathematical
   metacognitive monitoring of the students with high efficiency in
   mathematics learning were better than those of the other group. Their
   mathematical metacognitive characteristics were mainly reflected in the
   five dimensions of regulation, inspection, knowledge about individuals,
   knowledge about tasks, and knowledge about strategies. Furthermore, path
   analysis revealed that both mathematical metacognitive monitoring and
   mathematical metacognitive experience directly affected the mathematics
   achievement of students in the highly effective group. Mathematical
   metacognitive knowledge had an indirect effect on mathematics
   achievement. The findings imply that teachers should focus on the
   guidance of mathematical metacognition in mathematics instruction.},

Abstract = {Discrete mathematics and mathematical modelling, along with the
   educational discourse surrounding these, have many connections. However,
   ways that the educational discourse on discrete mathematics can benefit
   from the inclusion of examples of mathematical modelling and the
   accompanying discussion are currently under-researched. In this paper,
   we elaborate on the educational potential of examples of mathematical
   modelling based on the usage of methods from discrete mathematics, with
   a focus on secondary education. We first describe vertex-edge graphs as
   possible topics of discrete mathematics that are accessible at school
   level within modelling lessons. Secondly, in the context of a case
   study, we describe modelling activities with students at the end of
   lower-secondary education, using a classical problem of discrete
   mathematics originating from the Konigsberg bridge problem. The
   students' solution processes for this optimisation problem based on
   graph theory are described. Their approaches are examined referring to
   the phases of the modelling cycle, using the method of qualitative
   content analysis. We studied in particular the extent to which students
   use concepts related to vertex-edge graphs in specific sub-phases of the
   modelling process. The analysis allows the required sub-competences of
   modelling to be identified and the connection of these competences with
   discrete mathematics to be worked out. On the basis of this analysis,
   educational opportunities of teaching discrete mathematics and
   mathematical modelling are assessed. Overall, we point out the
   possibilities and opportunities for using examples from the field of
   discrete mathematics to acquire modelling competences and to foster the
   linkage of mathematical modelling and discrete mathematics at school
   level.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report on the cross-cultural comparative analysis that
   was undertaken as part of the Social Unit of Learning project
   investigating student collaborative problem solving in China and
   Australia. The video-based research examined the `negotiative foci' of
   dyadic student interaction during collaborative problem solving within
   the mathematics classroom setting. In the analysis we take negotiative
   focus as the central construct and compare the student interactions in
   terms of their focus on either facts and procedures, didactical norms,
   or social/interpersonal considerations. We report on the analysis based
   on an open-ended pair task (Household task) that was completed by year 7
   students (mostly 12- to 13-year olds) in China and Australia. In the
   study we analysed the video and written responses of 20 student pairs
   from three year 7 classes in China (40 students in total) and 25 student
   pairs from two year 7 classes in Australia (50 students in total). The
   findings from this comparative study provide empirical evidence
   regarding how the participating students in each country interpreted and
   negotiated meaning as they tackled the open-ended task collaboratively.},

Abstract = {In this survey paper we aim to provide an overview of research on
   mathematics textbooks and, more broadly, curriculum resources as
   instruments for change related to mathematical content, instructional
   goals and practices, and student learning of mathematics. In particular,
   we elaborate on the following themes: (1) The role of curriculum
   resources as instruments for change from a theoretical perspective; (2)
   The design of curriculum resources to mediate the implementation of
   reform ideas and innovative practice; (3) Teachers' influence on the
   implementation of change through curriculum resources; (4) Students'
   influence on the implementation of change through curriculum resources;
   and (5) Evidence of curriculum resources yielding changes in
   student-related factors or variables. We claim that, whilst textbooks
   and curriculum resources are influential, they alone cannot change
   teachers' teaching nor students' learning practices in times of
   curricular change. Moreover, more knowledge is needed about features of
   curriculum resources that support the implementation of change. We
   contend that curriculum innovations are likely to be successful, if
   teachers and students are supported to co- and re-design the relevant
   curriculum trajectories and materials in line with the reform efforts
   and their own individual needs.},

Abstract = {The argument of this theoretical paper is that the existence and
   availability of suitable digital curriculum resources, accelerated by
   the recent pandemic, have required a revision of the pedagogical
   landscape in terms of ways in which students can be empowered to
   (co-)design their own curriculum trajectories. For this purpose, I
   argue, students need to be supported in considering many connections, to
   arrive at coherent trajectories. Based on complexity thinking and
   curriculum design with digital resources, I propose the concept of
   connectivity as a crucial principle for creating coherent curriculum
   trajectories. If students are to become the co-designers of their own
   curriculum, they need a frame that raises their awareness about the many
   connections to be made and that supports their capability for actually
   realizing them. Drawing strongly on my own work and related work by
   others, I analyse and illustrate the connections made by students,
   teachers and curriculum designers in their design of mathematics tasks,
   lessons and learning trajectories with digital resources. Results show
   that connections can be made at several levels, namely, at a social
   level, at a material level, at programme level, and at a didactical
   level. Leaning on systems thinking, connections can be systematically
   considered, which is likely to help students to enhance the coherence of
   their designs. I contend that a student-designed `connected curriculum
   trajectory' is likely to become the focus of future research activities
   in innovative learning environments: this endeavor would connect aspects
   of curriculum, mathematical content, learning strategies of students,
   and the use of new technologies.},

Abstract = {The paper presents analyses of multivariable calculus learning-teaching
   phenomena through the lenses of DNR-based instruction, focusing on
   several foundational calculus concepts, including cross product,
   linearization, total derivative, Chain Rule, and implicit
   differentiation. The analyses delineate the nature of current
   multivariable calculus instruction and theorize the potential
   consequences of the two types of instruction to student learning. The
   following are among the consequences revealed: understanding the concept
   of function as a covariational processes, and the concept of derivative
   as a linear approximation; understanding the relation between
   composition of functions and their Jacobian matrices; understanding the
   idea underlying the concept of parametrization and the rationale
   underpinning the process of implicit differentiation; thinking in terms
   of structure, appending external inputs into a coherent mental
   representation, and making logical inferences.},

Abstract = {In this survey paper, we describe the state of the field of research on
   teaching mathematics with technology with an emphasis on the secondary
   school phase. We synthesize themes, questions, results and perspectives
   emphasized in the articles that appear in this issue alongside the
   relevant foundations of these ideas within the key journal articles,
   handbooks and conference papers. Our aim is to give an overview of the
   field that provides opportunities for readers to gain deeper insights
   into theoretical, methodological, practical and societal challenges that
   concern teaching mathematics with technology in its broadest sense.
   Although this collection of articles was developed prior to the global
   coronavirus pandemic, we have taken the opportunity to survey the
   contributing authors to provide some country perspectives on the impact
   the pandemic has had on mathematics teaching with technology in the
   period January-July 2020. We conclude the survey paper by identifying
   some areas for future research in this increasingly relevant topic.},

Abstract = {Records of online collaborative mathematical activity provide us with a
   novel, rich, searchable, accessible and sizeable source of data for
   empirical investigations into mathematical practice. In this paper we
   discuss how the resources of crowdsourced mathematics can be used to
   help formulate and answer questions about mathematical practice, and
   what their limitations might be. We describe quantitative approaches to
   studying crowdsourced mathematics, reviewing work from cognitive history
   (comparing individual and collaborative proofs); social psychology (on
   the prospects for a measure of collective intelligence); human-computer
   interaction (on the factors that led to the success of one such
   project); network analysis (on the differences between collaborations on
   open research problems and known-but-hard problems); and argumentation
   theory (on modelling the argument structures of online collaborations).
   We also give an overview of qualitative approaches, reviewing work from
   empirical philosophy (on explanation in crowdsourced mathematics);
   sociology of scientific knowledge (on conventions and conversations in
   online mathematics); and ethnography (on contrasting conceptions of
   collaboration). We suggest how these diverse methods can be applied to
   crowdsourced mathematics and when each might be appropriate.},

Abstract = {In this paper we introduce a theoretical framework concerned with
   fostering functional thinking in Grade 8 students by utilizing digital
   technologies. This framework is meant to be used to guide the systematic
   variation of tasks for implementation in the classroom while using
   digital technologies. Examples of problems and tasks illustrate this
   process. Additionally, results of an empirical investigation with Grade
   8 students, which focusses on the students' skills with digital
   technologies, how they utilize these tools when engaging with the
   developed tasks, and how they influence their functional thinking, are
   presented. The research aim is to investigate in which way tasks
   designed according to the theoretical framework could promote functional
   thinking while using digital technologies in the sense of the operative
   principle. The results show that the developed
   framework-Function-Operation-Matrix-is a sound basis for initiating
   students' actions in the sense of the operative principle, to foster the
   development of functional thinking in its three aspects, namely,
   assignment, co-variation and object, and that digital technologies can
   support this process in a meaningful way.},

Abstract = {In this study we investigated qualities of the mathematical discourse in
   four kindergarten classes in which kindergarten teachers and 5-year-old
   children engaged in mathematical learning activities. We analysed
   differences in the mathematical discourses in two experimental
   kindergarten classes and two control kindergarten classes, in a research
   and development project. The overarching research question guiding our
   study was as follows: what characterises the mathematical discourse
   unfolding in kindergarten classes? In our study we drew on the
   theoretical framework Mathematical Discourse in Instruction coined by
   Adler and Ronda, as we quantified the collected qualitative data. Our
   analyses identified significant characteristics of mathematical
   discourse with respect to the children's opportunities to contribute
   with ideas and arguments. The discourse in the kindergartens differed
   both with respect to the extent and nature of verbal utterances among
   the participants, as well as the mathematical engagement nurtured
   amongst the children. Moreover, the mathematical discourse within the
   experimental kindergarten classes, to a greater extent than that in the
   control kindergarten classes, initiated opportunities for the
   participating children's mathematical learning.},

   teachers' professional knowledge and their instructional quality in the
   domain of mathematics education. First, an overview is provided of the
   way in which mathematics professional knowledge has been conceptualized.
   Second, the relation between mathematics teachers' professional
   knowledge and instructional practice is outlined, with a special focus
   on the mediating role of teachers' professional beliefs and teachers'
   situation-specific knowledge and skills. Third, we describe the model of
   mathematics teachers' competence as an integrative model including
   knowledge, beliefs, situation-specific skills and observable classroom
   behavior. Fourth, we describe the current research on bridging teachers'
   professional knowledge and instructional quality, with special attention
   to recent issues with respect to the validation, development, and impact
   of professional competence. We end with some challenges for future
   research.},

Abstract = {In this study we investigated the structure of quantitative competence
   of kindergartners by testing a hypothesized four-factor model of
   quantitative competence consisting of the components counting,
   subitizing, additive reasoning and multiplicative reasoning. Data were
   collected from kindergartners in the Netherlands (n = 334) and in Cyprus
   (n = 304). A confirmatory factor analysis showed that the four-factor
   structure fitted the empirical data from the Netherlands. For the Cyprus
   data a one-factor structure was found to have a more adequate fit.
   Regarding the effect of country on performance, a comparison at item
   level showed that the kindergartners in the Netherlands outperformed
   those in Cyprus in the majority of quantitative competence items.
   Analyses of variance revealed for each country a significant effect of
   kindergarten year on performance, with children in K2 (second
   kindergarten year) outperforming those in K1 (first kindergarten year).
   A statistical implicative analysis at item level revealed that in both
   countries the relevant implicative chain, showing what successful
   solving of an item implies for correct solving of another item, reflects
   by and large the sequential steps mostly followed in teaching
   kindergartners early number. This sequence starts with counting and
   subitizing, then continues with additive reasoning and finally
   multiplicative reasoning. These implicative chains also clearly show
   that the development of early quantitative competence is not linear.
   There are many parallel processes and cross-connections between the
   components of quantitative competence.},

Abstract = {Observing the transition from industrial work to more and more
   digitalised work in the last decades, in this paper we discuss changes
   in employment and the relevance of numeracy in adult basic education and
   in working environments. In a knowledge society, the demand for highly
   qualified professionals is growing. It is questionable what effects this
   need will have on other occupational groups. Is there a higher risk of
   becoming more vulnerable as a result of a so-called `polarisation of the
   labour market'? Dealing with change in employment structures for
   industrialised countries, the authors examine the change in numeracy
   practices in the International Adult Literacy Survey compared with that
   in the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies.
   In a comparison of the two large-scale assessments, the authors are able
   to confirm a polarisation in the sense of more higher- and
   lower-qualified jobs and less medium-qualified jobs. Numeracy practices,
   however, have been decreasing across all occupational groups over the
   last 3 decades. Today there is a higher risk of becoming vulnerable if
   the occupations are part of a middle qualified job. More critical
   numeracy skills and a visibility of numeracy at work could reduce the
   risk of vulnerability.},

Abstract = {The construct of identity is increasingly recognized as a dominant and
   determining aspect in learning mathematics. While
   researcherscollectivelytheorize identity as situated and negotiated,
   they also draw attention to the unwieldy nature of the concept that
   makes it difficult to define and operationalize. The purpose of this
   paper is to contribute to the conversation on identity in mathematics
   education by providing a literature review through the lens of a
   four-part networked identity model configured by Ivani (1998) in the
   field of academic writing. Following a short introduction of the meaning
   of identity as a research construct, the paper discusses Ivani's four
   identity-related aspects that include autobiographical identity,
   discoursal identity, authorial identity, and socioculturally available
   identities. It then examines research in K-12 mathematics education that
   focuses on learners' identity through the perspective of Ivani's model
   to suggest an instrumental, yet tentative, multi-dimensional framework
   for exploring identity in mathematics education. The paper concludes
   with potential trajectories for future research.},

Abstract = {A vast body of research has shown that teacher identity matters, be it
   in mathematics or in any other subject. The means of investigating
   teacher identity greatly determine the knowledge we have; however, no
   review of the methodological approaches into this topic has yet been
   conducted. This paper provides an overview of the methodological
   approaches in the research on teacher identity in mathematics education,
   in order to initiate a discussion on developmental possibilities in
   terms of how future research on this topic could be carried out. We
   examine 52 studies, published between 2000 and 2017 in peer-reviewed
   scholarly journals, investigating the identities of student teachers
   and/or practitioners who were generalists and/or specialised mathematics
   teachers. We identified the following to be prevalent data sources in
   qualitative approaches: interviews, written reflections or narratives,
   and classroom observations. In terms of analytical approaches, the scene
   is rather monotonous. Finally, we provide suggestions for future
   methodological considerations, highlighting the need for researchers to
   label their methodological decisions in order to better situate and
   connect their work to other research on mathematics-related teacher
   identity.},

Abstract = {Differential and integral calculus textbooks are widely used as the main
   resource for teaching. They appear in a variety of forms and adopt
   various approaches to present the content. In this paper, we turn our
   attention to one chapter of a calculus textbook and our focus is on the
   introduction of the derivative concept. With the purpose of examining
   the presentation of the derivative concept in the textbook, we give a
   view of Peirce's semiotics, in particular of his classification of
   sign-vehicles. The analysis allows us to point out that the sign-vehicle
   in relation to the derivative concept may be iconic, indexical, or
   symbolic. These do not constitute mutually exclusive kinds of signs, but
   they are interrelated in such a way that we can identify iconicity in
   indexicality and indexicality in symbolicity. We conclude that the
   textbook has the potential to enable students to conceptualize the
   derivative. However, in some aspects, the book may constrain students'
   conceptualization and it could be improved to meet the students' needs
   to make meaning of the derivative concept.},

Abstract = {This article examines the work of 30 in-service teachers engaged with
   modelling activities during a course within an Ecuadorian master's
   degree program in mathematics teaching. These teachers experienced a
   sequence of activities designed to explore imaginative aspects of
   mathematical modelling and problem solving, inviting perspectives from
   life outside of school. They built rich connections between real-world
   phenomena and a range of ideas about functions and representations of
   them. An analysis of the teachers' work identifies a modelling
   resource-the representational imagination-describing its nature and the
   implications for models of classroom modelling aiming to support this
   resource.},

Abstract = {Comparison is a fundamental cognitive process that can support learning
   in a variety of domains, including mathematics. The current paper aims
   to summarize empirical findings that support recommendations on using
   comparison of multiple strategies in mathematics classrooms. We report
   the results of our classroom-based research on using comparison of
   multiple strategies to help students learn mathematics, which includes
   short-term experimental research and a year-long randomized controlled
   trial using a researcher-designed supplemental Algebra I curriculum.
   Findings indicated that comparing different solution methods for solving
   the same problem was particularly effective for supporting procedural
   flexibility across students and for supporting conceptual and procedural
   knowledge among students with some prior knowledge of one of the
   methods, but that teachers may need additional support in deciding what
   to compare and when to use comparison. Drawing from this research, we
   offer instructional recommendations for the effective use of comparison
   of multiple strategies for improving mathematics learning, including (a)
   regular and frequent comparison of alternative strategies, particularly
   after students have developed some fluency with one initial strategy;
   (b) judicious selection of strategies and problems to compare; (c)
   carefully-designed visual presentation of the multiple strategies; and
   (d) use of small group and whole class discussions around the comparison
   of multiple strategies, focusing particularly on the similarities,
   differences, affordances, and constraints of the different approaches.
   We conclude with suggestions for future work on comparing multiple
   strategies, including the continuing need for the development of, and
   rigorous evaluation of, curriculum materials and specific instructional
   techniques that effectively promote comparison.},

Abstract = {Promoting self-explanation (i.e., generating explanations for oneself in
   an attempt to make sense of new information) is a recommended study
   strategy and instructional practice. A meta-analysis of the literature
   on prompting self-explanation to improve mathematics learning confirmed
   that prompted self-explanation leads to a small to moderate improvement
   in procedural knowledge, conceptual knowledge and procedural transfer
   when assessed immediately after the intervention. However, evidence that
   self-explanation reliably promotes learning within a classroom context
   or retention of knowledge over a delay is much more limited. Moderator
   analyses indicated that the effect on immediate outcomes was stronger if
   scaffolding of high-quality explanation was provided but did not vary
   based on whether time on task was controlled across conditions. Based on
   the research literature, we propose instructional recommendations for
   mathematics educators: (a) scaffold high-quality explanations via
   training on self-explanation or structuring the self-explanation
   responses, (b) design explanation prompts so they do not sacrifice
   attention to other important content, (c) prompt learners to explain
   correct information, and (d) prompt learners to explain why common
   misconceptions are incorrect. We conclude with issues for future
   research, such as the need for additional research on effective use of
   self-explanation in classroom contexts and the merits of
   self-explanation relative to alternative instructional techniques.},

Abstract = {In the early 1980s, the theory of didactic situations put the analysis
   of mathematical activity at the core of the didactic analysis, thus
   initiating a new research programme in mathematics education: the
   epistemological programme. This paper describes and interprets some of
   the contributions of the anthropological theory of the didactic (ATD) to
   the development of this programme. These contributions come from the new
   institutional and ecological perspective provided by the ATD to approach
   the didactic problem and from the significance it assigns to
   macrodidactic phenomena characterised by didactic transposition. They
   are illustrated with research works involving different fields of school
   mathematics in which the ATD team led by Spanish researchers played a
   central role: research in school algebra and its relations with
   functional modelling, differential calculus, and real numbers. The paper
   concludes by briefly describing the contributions of the ATD to the
   dialogue between didactic theories, another domain that has notable
   Spanish contributions.},

Title = {Pre-service teachers' development of digital resource design capacity},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 26},
Abstract = {In the current digital age, (mathematics) teachers are provided with a
   profusion of digital resources. Consequently, research in mathematics
   education has focused on teachers' interactions with resources as the
   heart of their professional activity. The term Pedagogical Design
   Capacity (PDC) was introduced to designate teacher's ability to perceive
   affordances of resources and to make decisions about how to use them
   efficiently. PDC has been further conceptualized to define teacher
   design capacity (TDC) as including a goal or points of reference for the
   design, a set of design principles, and reflection-in-action. This
   definition is illustrated with case studies involving teachers' design
   of digital resources, yet it does not seem to consider the specificities
   of the latter. We therefore aim to further refine the concept of TDC by
   considering crucial components that designing technology-based tasks and
   their enactment in the classroom entail. We ask: What are the unique
   components of TDC specific to digital technology and resources? We
   elaborate a framework to suggest dimensions and components of
   mathematics teacher Digital Resource Design Capacity (DRDC) to emphasize
   the focus on design of digital resources. This framework is built on
   previous studies and on the concept of instrumental orchestration, and
   is refined taking into account findings from two case studies in France
   and Israel.},

Title = {The connections between citizenship education and mathematics education},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 7},
Abstract = {The connections between citizenship education and mathematics education
   have been the focus of theoretical development and attention by
   educators interested in issues of justice, equity, power, criticality,
   and citizen engagement with societal issues, across schools,
   universities, and adult education levels. In this survey article, we
   contribute to new knowledge in the field by identifying and describing
   three interconnected layers of influence on the praxis of teaching and
   learning: (1) perspectives from citizenship education and mathematics
   education (e.g., kinds of citizenship, critical thinking in mathematics
   education); (2) institutional factors (e.g., policy, curricula,
   implementation within education systems); and (3) emerging influences
   (e.g., changing skill demands, innovations from communities of
   practice). In exploring the connections between citizenship education
   and mathematics education, we go beyond extant theory development and
   point to influences such as global disruptions, societal changes,
   systemic structures at the national and local levels, messaging in the
   media, and the role of teachers and learners. The holistic analysis of
   these influences enables identification of tensions and dilemmas, and
   issues of identity, autonomy, adoption, and systemic change. Together
   these point to multiple implications for educators, policy makers, and
   researchers aiming to enable informed and engaged citizens.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the potential of university mathematics courses to
   advance teachers' knowledge regarding an important component of
   knowledge about the nature of mathematics as a scientific discipline,
   namely the mutual contribution between mathematics and various fields:
   mathematics contributes to solving problems in different fields, and
   different fields contribute to the development of mathematics by raising
   new mathematical questions and motivating the development of new
   concepts, methods and research areas. The study investigates (1) what
   teachers may learn about the nature of the mutual contribution in an
   academic program that includes university level mathematics courses that
   offer teachers ample opportunities to learn contemporary and historical
   mathematical modeling and applications, and (2) what mathematicians, who
   teach in this program, want to teach teachers about the nature of the
   mutual contribution. The main data sources included interviews with five
   mathematicians and 14 secondary school teachers. The results indicate
   that the mathematicians viewed the mutual contribution between
   mathematics and other fields as an important component of teachers'
   knowledge which they wished to advance, whereas the teachers reported
   only on considerably advancing their knowledge and appreciation
   regarding one direction: the contribution of mathematics to other
   fields. Interpretations of the results and future avenues to address
   this issue are discussed.},

Abstract = {Citizenship is a contested concept that can be interpreted from
   different - and also conflicting - perspectives. Inspired by inclusive
   mathematics education, we try to illustrate what it could mean to work
   toward inclusive citizenship. We illustrate the idea of inclusive
   mathematics education, showing how deaf and hearing students can learn
   together. We interpret inclusive mathematics education as `meetings
   amongst differences'. This interpretation inspires us to see meetings
   amongst differences in a broader perspective. Such meetings can be
   considered fundamental to the process of establishing inclusive
   citizenship. We elaborate on this idea by exemplifying how meetings
   across national, economic, cultural and existential differences can be
   established in mathematics education. We conclude that, to work toward
   inclusive citizenship, it is important to establish dialogues across
   distances; to make students interested in and able to see situations and
   problems from perspectives different from their own; to construct
   tolerance as an expression of shared concerns; and finally, to challenge
   any form of We-Other dichotomy.},

Abstract = {In the research described in this paper, we explored the way Palestinian
   teachers use the Arabic language to teach mathematics in Arabic. First,
   we address the issue from an historical overview of the context of
   study. The historical overview allows us to situate the current context
   of teaching mathematics in Arabic in Palestine. We rely on Halliday's
   concept of register to define what we call ``Mathematical Arabic For
   Teaching{''}. It allows us to focus our study, and to address the issue
   of combination between this register to be developed by the teachers and
   the Arabic textbook content. Our theoretical framework is based on a
   combination of the theories Documentational Approach to Didactics and
   Mathematical Discourse in Instruction, which allows us to discuss
   mathematical Arabic for teaching as a resource. We based our exploratory
   study on the case of three teachers, chosen according to well-defined
   criteria. We explored the issue through audio recordings of their
   lessons teaching tenth graders the signs of quadratic functions, and
   video recorded interviews on their reflections on those lessons. We
   identified three combinations between the teachers' Mathematical Arabic
   For Teaching and the use of the mathematics textbook, namely,
   complementarity, tension and equivalence. We conclude with some
   implications of these forms of combination.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we turn to the notion of networking theories with the aim
   of contrasting two theoretical mathematics education perspectives
   inspired by Vygotsky's work, namely, the Theory of Objectification and
   the Documentational Approach to Didactics. We are interested in
   comparing/contrasting these theories in accordance with the following
   three main questions: (a) the role that the theories ascribe to language
   and resources; (b) the conceptions that the theories bring forward
   concerning the teacher, and (c) the understandings they offer of the
   mathematics classroom. In the first part of the paper, some basic
   concepts of each perspective are presented. The second part includes
   some episodes from a lesson on the teaching and learning of algebra in a
   Grade 1 class (6-7-year-old students). The episodes serve as background
   to carry out, in the third part of the paper, a dialogue between
   proponents of the theoretical perspectives around the identified main
   questions. The dialogue shows some theoretical complementarities and
   differences and reveals, in particular, different conceptions of the
   teacher and the limits and possibilities that language affords in
   teaching-learning mathematics.},

Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The mathematical medium of data visualization and other data
   representations (DV) has served as a primary means of communicating
   about the COVID-19 crisis. DVs about the pandemic are highly visible
   across news journalism and include an increasingly innovative and
   diverse set of representational forms. These representational forms
   employ multimodal, interactive, and narrative elements, among others,
   that create new possibilities for data storytelling. Building on current
   efforts to expand the teaching and learning of data practices in K-12
   mathematics education, we argue that innovative DVs create new
   opportunities for teaching and learning mathematics, particularly during
   times of crisis. We illustrate our argument using three examples of
   innovative DVs from news journalism. We discuss how these DVs could
   serve as complementary resources alongside conventional graphs to
   support students as they use mathematics and mathematical
   representations to make sense of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Our commentary seeks to bring current trends in data representation to
   bear in mathematics education. Leveraging such trends offers artifacts
   useful for teaching and opens up space for elevating emotion and
   experience as important aspects of mathematics curricula.},

Abstract = {While classical studies have highlighted the many potential benefits of
   using original historical sources in the classroom, few studies have
   documented actual classroom practices outside of research contexts. In
   this case study, I aim to describe and explain how five French high
   school teachers autonomously designed and implemented classroom sessions
   starting from the same document, namely an excerpt from Euler's Elements
   of Algebra presenting an algorithm for square root approximation. From a
   methodological viewpoint, it enables me show how two general frameworks
   for the study of teachers' professional practices-the Documentational
   Approach to Didactics and the Didactic and Ergonomic Double Approach-can
   be tailored to fit the specific challenges of using historical sources.
   The empirical results provide fresh insights into the conditions for a
   mathematically rich use of historical sources in the classroom, and on
   the connections between this use and the integration of a historical
   perspective in the teaching of mathematics.},

Abstract = {This study forms part of a classroom teaching experiment on the
   development of a group of 25 9-10 years old students' algebraic
   thinking. More specifically, it explored their reasoning while solving
   word problems built around functional relationships to determine how
   they generalized through questions posed using natural language, drawn
   figures or the keyword `many'. Their written and oral answers to those
   questions were analyzed qualitatively to determine which approach most
   effectively supported the expression of their generalization. The
   results reveal the benefits of posing questions about the general case
   in different ways while teaching students to use conventional algebraic
   representations. According to these findings, representing indeterminate
   quantities with the keyword `many' induces generalization more
   successfully than representing them with letters. The use of letters
   prompts students to seek meaning for the letters, either conventionally,
   as an unknown or variable quantity, or otherwise, as a label or specific
   values assigned according to their own criteria. Identifying the most
   effective procedures may help teachers and curriculum designers
   formulate mathematical tasks that encourage students to express the
   generality they perceive in particular cases. Determining the
   communication demands of each approach is likewise highly useful.},

Abstract = {A key aspect of young children's development of algebraic reasoning is
   the process of visualising and identifying structures to both abstract
   and generalise. There has been a growing body of research focused on how
   students form generalisations, this article adds to the existing body of
   research by examining how young culturally diverse students identify
   mathematical structures in contextual growing patterns and the teaching
   and learning actions that assist them to generalise. Data were collected
   from one classroom of 29 Year Two (6 years old) students in a low
   socio-economic school in New Zealand. Results from the analysis of
   lessons related to two tasks showed that the contextual tasks led
   students to notice different mathematical structures. Specific
   pedagogical actions were used to facilitate students' engagement with
   the growing patterns. These included positioning students to engage with
   different representations (pictorial and numerical, tabular, and natural
   language) to represent thinking, the use of classroom discussions,
   noticing and responding to student thinking, and pressing students to
   find far terms. The findings highlight that both the contextual
   patterning tasks and teacher actions supported the young students to
   develop a range of sophisticated generalisations related to the
   underlying mathematical structure and functional relationships of the
   growing patterns.},

Title = {Coordinating invisible and visible sameness within equivalence
   transformations of numerical equalities by 10-to 12-year-olds in their

Abstract = {``They are the same{''} is a phrase that teachers often hear from their
   students in arithmetic and algebra. But what do students mean when they
   say this? The present paper researches the notion of sameness within
   algebraic thinking in the context of generating equivalent numerical
   equalities. A group of Grade 6 Mexican students (10- to 12-year-olds)
   was presented with tasks that required transforming the given numerical
   equalities in such a way as to show their truth-value. The students
   initially indicated this by calculating and demonstrating that the total
   was the same on both sides. When asked not to calculate, their
   approaches evolved into more structural transformations involving
   decomposition so as to arrive at an equality with the same expression on
   each side. Students used the language of sameness-both visible and
   invisible-to describe the truth-value of their transformed expressions
   and equalities. The visible sameness referred to the resulting identical
   form of each side of the equality and the invisible sameness to the
   top-down equivalences that they had generated by their decomposing
   transformations-both types of sameness being characterized by their
   hidden numerical values. These findings suggest implications for
   transitioning to the algebraic domain of equations with their similarly
   hidden values.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, there has been considerable research that explores
   the teaching and learning of combinatorics. Such work has highlighted
   the fact that understanding and justifying combinatorial formulas can be
   challenging for students, and there is a need to identify ways to
   support students' combinatorial reasoning. In this paper, we contribute
   to research that explores effective ways to foster students'
   combinatorial reasoning by highlighting the role that shifts in
   representational registers can play in supporting students'
   combinatorial reasoning and activity. In particular, we present a case
   in which two students, aged 12 and 14, reasoned about, and developed a
   formula for, binomial coefficients. This occurred in a teaching
   experiment designed to examine their generalizing activity. In these
   interviews, the students first solved problems about determining the
   volume of a cube and then shifted to a combinatorial interpretation of
   this task, leveraging binomial coefficients as a way to consider growth
   in higher dimensions. The students demonstrated sophisticated reasoning
   about combinatorial tasks and were ultimately able to generate and
   understand a formula for binomial coefficients. In framing this case, we
   focus on the students' use of different representations, highlighting
   the power of being able to transition between representational registers
   as a way of supporting students' combinatorial reasoning. In this way,
   our case demonstrates the value of representational registers
   specifically as a mechanism by which to potentially improve the teaching
   and learning of combinatorics.},

Abstract = {Mathematical competitions feature in most developed countries as a part
   of the secondary school experience, but to a lesser extent in developing
   countries. In this paper we investigate how widespread these
   competitions are in Africa, both historically as well as currently,
   focussing both on national Olympiads and on the participation of African
   countries in competitions beyond their borders, such as the
   continent-wide Pan African Mathematical Olympiad and the global
   International Mathematical Olympiad. Since we could not find a
   consolidated source of information on African competitions, we include
   many details and links, hoping that this paper will serve as a valuable
   starting point for future investigators. Next, we present some survey
   findings on the attitudes towards and experiences of mathematical
   competitions, both from the perspective of teachers in secondary schools
   as well as from secondary school students, and whether these experiences
   have served to improve or degrade their perceptions of mathematics in
   general. Among other results, we find that teachers view their students'
   participation in mathematics competitions as being important, with the
   biggest barrier to participation being that there are not enough
   competitions at appropriate levels available, and that students enjoy
   mathematics competitions and are more likely to pursue a STEM career
   because of them. Finally, we present some suggestions on how this
   research may be taken further, and on how the state of mathematical
   competition culture in Africa may be improved.},

Abstract = {In this special issue we introduce the state of the art of empirical
   studies on creativity in mathematics and mathematics education. To do so
   we conducted a retrospective analysis of empirical studies on
   mathematical creativity with special attention to the studies conducted
   during the last decade. In the paper we present a brief survey of
   research on mathematical creativity up to 2009 and then a detailed
   review of empirical studies performed during the past decade. We note an
   optimistic development of attention paid to mathematical creativity in
   schools. A systematic search conducted to examine research on creativity
   in mathematics education journals and research in the field of
   mathematics in creativity-related journals, yielded 49 papers that
   described empirical studies on creativity in mathematics education. The
   retrospective analysis examined the following: (a) the main goals of the
   studies; (b) conceptual frameworks used by the researchers; (c) research
   methodologies; and (d) tools and tasks. Of these, 18 studies examined
   the relationships between creativity in mathematics and other
   characteristics, 25 were on creativity related to instructional
   practices and mathematical tasks, and 6 studies investigated teachers'
   creativity-related conceptions and competencies. Of these studies, 29
   used quantitative methodologies, 10 of which integrated analysis for
   problem solving or problem posing strategies or outcomes. Ten additional
   studies employed qualitative methodology (mainly content analysis of
   lesson observations). We conclude the paper with a short review of
   papers in this special issue, and outline directions for future research
   on creativity in mathematics (education).},

Abstract = {This paper addresses implementation with respect to the professional
   development (PD) of teachers of mathematics and the
   educators/didacticians who work with them, through an inquiry-based
   developmental model. In contrast with a PD model in which educators
   show, guide or instruct teachers in classroom approaches and
   mathematical tasks, we present a developmental model in which teachers
   and educators collaborate to inquire into and develop their own teaching
   practice. The project, Learning Communities in Mathematics (LCM: e.g.,
   Goodchild, Fuglestad and Jaworski, 2013) exemplifies this developmental
   model. Here we focus on a project Teaching Better Mathematics (TBM)
   which extends LCM and implements its developmental model at larger
   scale. We trace the implementation process through analysis of data
   gathered during and after the extended project, including written
   reflections of key didacticians, minutes from leadership meetings and
   two versions of the project proposal. Particularly, we trace learning
   and development through an activity theory analysis of the issues,
   tensions and contradictions experienced by participation in TBM.},

Abstract = {Against the background of providing learning opportunities for
   meaningful mathematics for all students, the presented Design Research
   study had the goal of investigating how to support students facing
   language barriers while learning mathematics in phases of unmoderated
   group work. For this purpose, learning meaningful mathematics and
   demanding discourse practices are connected with quality interaction
   characteristics identified in research on productive group work. This
   theoretical consideration was implemented in a learning arrangement on
   similarity by means of four design principles for enhancing language in
   group work on meaningful mathematics. The empirical insights show to
   what extent the intended demanding discourse practices and quality
   interaction characteristics can be identified in different steps of
   knowledge construction, and to what extent they are supported by the
   design element `role cards'. Instead of calling for less unmoderated
   group work for students facing language barriers, the results of the
   study suggest that more research is needed to design scaffolds matching
   students' needs, aside from whole-class discussions.},

Abstract = {Research on mathematical problem solving has a long tradition: retracing
   its fascinating story sheds light on its intricacies and, therefore, on
   its needs. When we analyze this impressive literature, a critical issue
   emerges clearly, namely, the presence of words and expressions having
   many and sometimes opposite meanings. Significant examples are the terms
   `realistic' and `modeling' associated with word problems in school.
   Understanding how these terms are used is important in research, because
   this issue relates to the design of several studies and to the
   interpretation of a large number of phenomena, such as the well-known
   phenomenon of students' suspension of sense making when they solve
   mathematical problems. In order to deepen our understanding of this
   phenomenon, we describe a large empirical and qualitative study focused
   on the effects of variations in the presentation (text, picture, format)
   of word problems on students' approaches to these problems. The results
   of our study show that the phenomenon of suspension of sense making is
   more precisely a phenomenon of activation of alternative kinds of sense
   making: the different kinds of active sense making appear to be strongly
   affected by the presentation of the word problem.},

Abstract = {Histories of mathematical practice account for mathematical knowledge
   and action by interpreting presently-available evidence as traces of the
   events, contexts, and relations that make up the past. Interpretations
   depend on the assumptions one makes about how mathematical knowledge
   works, insofar as it is knowledge and insofar as it is mathematical.
   Though the specific rules and their meanings can differ from context to
   context, mathematics is a kind of ruly knowledge, expected to follow
   orderly patterns and principles wherever it is found. The contexts and
   activities of mathematical practice-how that knowledge is made, shared,
   applied, and understood-are necessarily less ruly, and different
   practices leave or occlude different kinds of evidence for historical
   interpretation. The apparent ruliness of mathematics can be both a
   resource and an obstacle for understanding its unruly pasts. Historians'
   interpretive assumptions and goals have been shaped by centuries of
   interaction between mathematics research, history, and education. As a
   guide for mathematics educators and education researchers to historical
   perspectives on mathematical practice, this article briefly introduces
   four major interpretive traditions that inform the present discipline of
   mathematics history. It then illustrates some interpretive approaches
   and challenges through the history of blackboards in mathematical
   practice before explaining the two broad kinds of historical
   interpretation applied to mathematical practices. Reconstruction
   involves understanding the conditions and contexts of practices in a
   single historical moment. Genealogy, by contrast, connects elements of
   the past across time through transmission, interpretation, adaptation,
   and other kinds of preservation and change.},

Title = {An investigation of the relationship between academic numeracy of
   university students in South Africa and their mathematical and language

Abstract = {In South Africa many school-leavers are underprepared for higher
   education, especially in academic literacies, including numeracy. It is
   important for higher education to identify the students most vulnerable
   to failure in coping with the numeracy demands of the curriculum, so
   that resources available for interventions can be most fairly used. To
   this end, we seek to answer the question: `What is the relationship
   between students' academic numeracy and their mathematical and language
   competence.' We investigate the relationship between students' academic
   numeracy scores (on a test reflecting the expectations of higher
   education) and their writing of four school-leaving examinations that
   reflect most directly mathematical competence and language ability. In a
   sample of 7464 students, only 13\% had numeracy test scores that were
   classified as proficient, almost all of whom had studied Mathematics and
   English Home Language. Almost 90\% of those who took Mathematical
   Literacy and English First Additional Language achieved scores in the
   lowest category. Comparing the test score distributions of groups of
   students defined in terms of the mathematics and language school subject
   combinations, reveals that mathematics competence and language ability
   are equally related to students' academic numeracy. The results indicate
   the need for curriculum reforms in schools and in higher education.
   Ideally, development of students' academic numeracy should be infused in
   the teaching of the disciplinary discourses. The effectiveness of
   interventions intended to improve academic numeracy will be enhanced if
   they focus not only on quantitative competence but also on language
   development.},

Title = {Cardinality principle understanding: the role of focusing on the

Abstract = {The cardinality principle (CP) is a conceptual basis of counting
   collections meaningfully and provides a foundation for understanding
   other key aspects of numeracy, such as the successor principle or
   counting-on to determine sums. Unfortunately, little research has
   focused on how best to teach the CP. One suggestion is that modeling the
   CP should be done with small collections children can subitize-that is,
   immediately recognize the total without counting. The present study was
   designed to investigate the following key, not fully resolved,
   questions: Is subitizing level associated with CP knowledge and is a
   particular level of subitizing critical for achieving the CP? Does
   fostering children's subitizing ability improve CP knowledge? Which
   approach to modeling the CP with subitizable collections is most
   efficacious in promoting the CP and its transfer? Eighty 2- to
   5-year-old participants first received instruction designed to promote
   the ability to subitize collections from 1 to 5. Subitizing instruction
   alone resulted in 31 participants learning the CP. The remaining 49
   participants were randomly assigned to one of three CP interventions:
   count-first, label-first, and count-only. All interventions involved
   collections participants could subitize. Results revealed that the
   participants who could subitize at least three achieved partial success
   on the CP task. Those who could subitize four and were in the
   count-first intervention achieved general success on the CP task. The
   findings underscore the need for early childhood educators and parents
   to build on subitizing ability to teach the CP.},

Abstract = {An Australian longitudinal study of 319 Kindergartners developed,
   implemented and evaluated an intervention, the Pattern and Structure
   Mathematics Awareness Program (PASMAP). It comprised of repetitions and
   growing patterns, structured counting and grouping, grids and shapes,
   partitioning, additive and multiplicative structures, measurement and
   data, and transformations. Each component was implemented, evaluated and
   refined as a cyclic process in collaboration with co-operating teachers,
   replacing and extending the regular mathematics program. An innovative
   pedagogical approach was effective in engaging students in modelling and
   representing, visualising and generalising, and sustaining their
   learning. On an interview-based measure of mathematics achievement pre-
   and post-intervention, there were significant differences found between
   the intervention and comparison groups at the end of the intervention
   year (p < 0.026) and highly significant differences found at the
   follow-up assessment (p < 0.002) ten months later. A descriptive
   analysis showed students' progress through five levels of structural
   development where most students advanced through one or more levels as
   they progressed through the program. The upper third of students
   demonstrated emergent generalisations at the structural and advanced
   structural level which supported early algebraic thinking. Less-able
   students also showed impressive growth-half of these students moved from
   pre-structural to at least emergent level over the duration of the
   program. Students' growth in structural development is exemplified at
   five points during the intervention through fine-grained analyses of
   mathematical representations and explanations. The study demonstrates
   that Kindergartners are capable of developing mathematical patterns and
   structural relationships well beyond curriculum expectations.},

Abstract = {The workplace practices of engineers have changed due to the ubiquity of
   digital technology. So-called techno-mathematical literacies (TmL), seen
   as a domain specification of 21st-century skills, are essential for
   future engineers. How these TmL can be fostered in their education,
   however, is still unclear. To address this issue, we conducted a design
   study in which we developed a course in applied mathematics for higher
   technical professional education with TmL as central learning goals.
   This paper describes the design and implementation of the course in a
   first design cycle with 59 chemistry students. We focus on the teaching
   strategies that the lecturer used to stimulate the development of
   students' TmL. In classroom discussions, in the so-called feedback hours
   on which students' collaborative work on TmL was centered, context-based
   cases were discussed. Results include didactical, process, and
   inquiry-based learning strategies used by the lecturer.},

Abstract = {Maintaining shared understanding in classroom interaction is challenging
   for both teachers and students. In this paper, we consider the role of
   teachers' gestures in promoting shared understanding. Our specific aim
   was to document ways in which teachers use their own gestures to support
   students' contributions to the classroom discourse. We present three
   illustrative cases that represent the range of variation in teachers'
   use of speech (i.e., repeating the students' speech vs. not speaking at
   all) and variation in the spatial positioning of the teacher, the
   student, and the referents of the student's speech. We argue that
   teachers use gestures, both to ensure that they share common ground with
   the individual student who is speaking and to foster common ground among
   the class as a whole.},

Abstract = {A central issue in the mathematics curriculum is that we want students
   to make connections. This issue has been analysed in a series of
   curricula and instruction design and analysis studies. Moving towards
   mathematics connectionsand away from treating mathematics as a body of
   isolated concepts and proceduresis an important goal of mathematics
   education. Although many studies identify whole number bias in learning
   fractions, few studies have examined how this bias may be overcome. In
   this paper, I aim to clarify how problem variation in Chinese textbooks
   helps to make concept connections between fractions and whole numbers.
   To the best of my knowledge, this study systematically addresses the
   central issue of using the unity of four fraction operations and whole
   number arithmetic to overcome long-standing whole number bias for the
   first time. The lack of such methods represents a significant gap in
   curriculum practice. This study's framework for understanding variation
   practice to make connections, with an emphasis on the invariant
   concepts, also is helpful for the analysis of textbook or instructional
   design, which represents another significant gap in curriculum
   development theory.},

Abstract = {Randomness and distribution are important concepts underpinning the
   ability to think and reason probabilistically. Traditional approaches to
   teaching the Poisson distribution focus on mathematical definitions and
   formulae which obscure the randomness intrinsic in this process.
   Advances in technology have made it possible for students learning about
   probability to model the Poisson process. In this paper we explore the
   reasoning of six introductory probability students as they interacted
   with a prototype software designed to visibilize randomness, and to make
   transparent the link between the Poisson and exponential distributions.
   We focus on a task involving both real data and simulated data. Our
   findings highlight the fact that the tool and tasks seem to help
   students' understanding of the link between the Poisson and exponential
   distributions, and to gain a deeper appreciation of distribution and
   randomness.},

Abstract = {Considering the general problem of integrating mathematical modelling
   into current educational systems, this paper focuses on the ecological
   dimension of this problem-the institutional constraints that hinder the
   development of mathematical modelling as a normalised teaching
   activity-and the inevitable step of the professional development of
   teachers. Within the framework of the Anthropological Theory of the
   Didactic, this step is approached using the study and research paths for
   teacher education (SRP-TE), an inquiry-based process combining practical
   and theoretical questioning of school mathematical activities. We
   present a research study focusing on the design and analysis of an
   online and distance-learning course for in-service mathematics teachers
   based on the SRP-TE methodology. This course starts from the initial
   question of how to analyse, adapt and integrate a learning process
   related to mathematical modelling and how to sustain its long-term
   development. Our analysis is based on a case study consisting in four
   successive editions of a course for Latin American in-service
   mathematics teachers held at the Centre for Applied Research in Advanced
   Science and Technology in Mexico. The starting point is a modelling
   activity about forecasting the number of Facebook users, which includes
   functional modelling and regression. The results show how the course
   represents a valuable instrument to help teachers progress in the
   critical issue of identifying institutional constraints-most of them
   beyond the scope of action of teachers and students and not approached
   by previous research-hindering the integration of mathematical modelling
   in current secondary schools.},

Abstract = {Based on a teaching intervention with modelling activities involving
   experimental work in 9th grade classes, the goal of this study is to
   find out how students estimate the credibility a modelling task setting
   when it integrates a hands-on experimental approach. The theoretical
   background is based on the concept of authenticity and its long
   tradition in mathematical modelling and inquiry-based learning and
   advances a path of discussion around the concept of credibility. This is
   done in close connection to the relevance of experiments and hands-on
   activities in mathematical modelling in line with a science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics approach. The students were assigned the
   task of creating custom colour paint, responding to an order from a
   customer in a paint manufacturing company. The empirical data were
   collected from the observation of two classes and a questionnaire after
   completion of the task. The results indicate that students viewed the
   event as credible, as well as the goal of the task. They also considered
   the experimental work to be necessary and found the mathematical model
   obtained to be feasible. Moreover the students showed awareness of a
   distinction between their experiments and models and those developed by
   professionals. In short, the students ascribed credibility to the task
   setting and were able to acknowledge an approximation to reality in both
   the prototype created and the model built.},

Abstract = {Using Amabile's componential theory of creativity as a framework, this
   paper analyzes how Chinese mathematics teachers achieve creative
   teaching through acquiring in-depth domain-specific knowledge in
   mathematics, developing creativity-related skills, as well as
   stimulating student interest in learning mathematics, through
   well-crafted, activity-enriched lessons. It argues that creative
   mathematics teaching in the Chinese context is reference-based. There is
   a standard on what good teaching should look like and there is a greater
   emphasis on appropriateness in addition to novelty. Chinese mathematics
   classrooms are also mostly teacher-led, and Chinese teachers often spend
   a great deal of time to harness their creative teaching methods through
   various levels of professional development. The mechanism of exemplary
   mathematics lesson contest fosters collaborations among teachers on
   course preparation to achieve more effective mathematics teaching. Both
   features are consistent with the Chinese view of creativity.
   Implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the impact of the course ``Teaching and Learning of
   Mathematics (Grades 7 and 8){''} for the preparation of pre-service
   secondary mathematics teachers. It examines how pre-service teachers
   perceived mathematical problem solving and communicating mathematical
   knowledge before and after the course. The main objective of the course
   is to equip them with a working knowledge of basic teaching principles,
   an understanding of the theories of learning that inform instruction,
   and a thorough knowledge of the curriculum. The participants of the
   study are professor X, who teaches the course, and her five pre-service
   teachers (PTs). The PTs wrote a journal entry after every topic explored
   during the tutorials, detailing their learning during the course of
   study. For their journals, specific prompts were provided for them to
   reflect on their learning and experiences. At the end of the course the
   PTs were also interviewed. The interview sought PTs perceptions about
   their communication of mathematical knowledge during the microteaching
   sessions. The data collected were subjected to qualitative analysis. The
   findings of the study show that the course deepened PT's knowledge of
   mathematical problem solving and also shaped their ideas about how to
   communicate mathematical knowledge in ways that address the why and how

Abstract = {While a wide range of approaches and tools have been used to study
   children's creativity in school contexts, less emphasis has been placed
   on revealing students' creativity at university level. The present paper
   is focused on defining a tool that provides information about
   mathematical creativity of prospective mathematics teachers in problem-
   posing situations. To characterize individual differences, a method to
   determine the geometry-problem-posing cognitive style of a student was
   developed. This method consists of analyzing the student's products
   (i.e. the posed problems) based on three criteria. The first of these is
   concerned with the validity of the student's proposals, and two bi-polar
   criteria detect the student's personal manner in the heuristics of
   addressing the task: Geometric Nature (GN) of the posed problems
   (characterized by two opposite features: qualitative versus metric), and
   Conceptual Dispersion (CD) of the posed problems (characterized by two
   opposite features: structured versus entropic). Our data converge on the
   fact that cognitive flexibility-a basic indicator of
   creativity-inversely correlates with a style that has dominance in
   metric GN and structured CD, showing that the detected cognitive style
   may be a good predictor of students' mathematical creativity.},

Title = {Interdependency, alternative forms of mathematical agency and joy as
   challenges to ableist narratives about the learning and teaching of
   mathematics},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 4},
Abstract = {Catering for the mathematical needs of disabled learners equitably and
   productively requires the anti-ableist preparation and professional
   development of teachers. In CAPTeaM (Challenging Ableist Perspectives on
   the Teaching of Mathematics), we design tasks that emulate
   inclusion-related challenges from the mathematics classroom, and we
   engage teachers with these tasks in workshop settings. In this paper, we
   focus on evidence from one type of task in which participants engage in
   small groups with solving a mathematical problem while at least one of
   them is temporarily and artificially deprived of access to a sensory
   field or familiar channel of communication. In this paper, we focus on
   evidence of emerging resignification - discursive and affective shifts
   in the participating teachers' sense-making about what makes the
   construction of mathematical meaning possible and valuably different -
   as they work on the tasks. By linking Vygotsky's vision about the
   educational changes required to empower and include disabled learners
   with more contemporary ideas from embodied cognition and disability
   studies, our analyses show how engagement with the tasks affects
   participants' realisation and appreciation of interdependencies between
   learners, teacher, resources, and emotions, highlights alternative forms
   of mathematical agency and gives opportunities to turn initial sense of
   impasse and despair into joy.},

Title = {Students' mathematics self-efficacy: a scoping review},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 17},
Abstract = {Students' mathematics self-efficacy (MSE) is strongly associated with
   learning behaviours and performance, and students' future career
   choices. In our scoping review, we screened what substantive foci
   (conceptualization, directionality and role of MSE, change in MSE, and
   situational specificity of MSE) have been posed and which methodological
   approaches (participants, analytical methods, data sources, and
   congruence of measures) have been used in recent (2018-2022) studies of
   MSE. Studies of MSE were clearly in the mathematics domain with 21 of 49
   included studies exploring specific mathematics areas. The key focus was
   on strength of MSE. International databases (i.e., PISA) have enabled
   broad generalization, while in-depth qualitative studies enable minute
   situation-specificity. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies using
   hierarchically nested designs (i.e., students in classrooms) enable us
   to draw conclusions at both individual, classroom, and school levels.
   The current state-of-the-art indicates methodological advancement is
   rapid and we are likely to see further methodological-substantive
   synergies in the field of MSE in future studies. We see the potential

Abstract = {Understanding the structure, antecedents, and outcomes of students'
   emotions has become a topic of major interest in research on mathematics
   education. Much of this work is based on the Achievement Emotions
   Questionnaire-Mathematics (AEQ-M), a self-report instrument assessing
   students' mathematics-related emotions. The AEQ-M measures seven
   emotions (enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness,
   boredom) across class, learning, and test contexts (internal structure).
   Based on control-value theory, it is assumed that these emotions are
   evoked by control and value appraisals, and that they influence
   students' motivation, learning strategies, and performance (external
   relations). Despite the popularity and frequent use of the AEQ-M, the
   research leading to its development has never been published, creating
   uncertainty about the validity of the proposed internal structure and
   external relations. We close this gap in Study 1 (N = 781 students,
   Grades 5-10, mean age 14.1 years, 53.5\% female) by demonstrating that
   emotions are organized across contexts and linked to their proposed
   antecedents and outcomes. Study 2 (N = 699 students, Grade 7 and 9, mean
   age 14.0 years, 56.9\% female) addresses another deficit in research on
   the AEQ-M, the lack of evidence regarding the assumption that emotions
   represent sets of interrelated affective, cognitive, motivational, and
   physiological/expressive components. We close this gap by evaluating
   extended AEQ-M scales, systematically assessing these components for
   five core mathematics emotions (enjoyment, anger, anxiety, hopelessness,
   boredom). Our work provides solid grounds for future research using the
   AEQ-M to assess emotions and their components in the domain of
   mathematics.},

Abstract = {In this paper, drawing on the philosophy of dialectical materialism, we
   present an elaboration of two concepts that tend to remain backstage in
   debates in the field of history in mathematics education, namely, the
   concept of mathematics learning and the concept of classroom mathematics
   knowledge. The elaboration of these two concepts makes room to return to
   the longstanding question of the role of history in mathematics
   education. We argue that the history of mathematics in education is not
   a choice but a need-a central part of the process of understanding our
   human nature as essentially historical and cultural. We illustrate these
   ideas through the analysis of the encounter of a group of prospective
   teachers with a 14th century problem about motion. In this encounter the
   students engaged critically in conversations with voices of the past,
   while restoring the aesthetic, ethical, and historical dimensions of
   knowing and learning.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the role and
   scope of historical knowledge in work on using history of mathematics in
   education. This work can come from three types of actors, namely,
   teachers, teacher trainers, and educational researchers. The texts
   written by these actors show that their objectives and practices can be
   different, as is the historical knowledge they deploy. We can read
   writings of teachers who seek to `give meaning' to school knowledge, by
   integrating original texts into their teaching progression. We also can
   read writings of educational researchers who prepare `history capsules'
   for teachers, which can be introduced into teaching from time to time.
   To carry out this research, I focus on analyzing the complex
   relationships between the following three poles: objectives, pedagogical
   practices, and historical knowledge. To this end, I use the notion of
   ideal types introduced and developed by the sociologist Max Weber.
   Section 1 is devoted to the construction of ideal types corresponding to
   my aim. Based on these ideal types, in Sect. 2, I elaborate on the role
   and scope of historical knowledge in concrete situations where the
   history of mathematics is used; specifically, on the one hand during the
   reading of original texts in an educational context, and on the other
   hand, in the particular context of teachers education. Some further
   comments are made in the third and last section.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the nature of student-generated representations
   that support students' early algebraic reasoning in the realm of
   generalized arithmetic. We analyzed representations created by students
   for the following qualities: representations that distinguish the
   behavior of one operation from another, that support an explanation of a
   specific case of a generalization, and that support justification of a
   generalization. One key finding is that representations in the form of
   pictures, diagrams, arrangements of manipulatives, or story contexts
   that embody the meaning of the operation(s) allow students to
   distinguish between operations. Such representations can be used by
   young students to illustrate relationships conveyed in specific
   instances of a general claim. Further, extending these representations
   to class of numbers is a mechanism for proving a general claim.},

Abstract = {Teacher noticing has become increasingly acknowledged as a fundamental
   aspect of teacher professional competence. Teacher education scholars
   have examined how the development of noticing might be supported both in
   initial teacher education and in professional development. In
   mathematics teacher education, several studies have explored the use of
   video as a supporting tool for teacher noticing. It remains unclear how
   this body of work builds on the various theoretical perspectives of
   noticing prevalent in the literature, thus broadening our understanding
   of noticing. Furthermore, the field has not examined systematically the
   extent to which research has leveraged the affordances of digital video
   technologies, and whether scholars have employed different research
   methods to answer questions that are critical to teacher educators. This
   survey paper reviews studies published in the last two decades on
   programs centered on mathematics teacher noticing that used video as a
   supporting tool for teacher learning. Thirty-five peer-reviewed papers
   written in English were identified and coded along three dimensions: (1)
   theoretical perspectives; (2) use of video technologies; and (3)
   research questions and methods. This review summarizes important
   findings and highlights several directions for future research. Most
   studies involved pre-service teachers, and only a few centered on
   in-service teachers. Developers of the large majority of programs took a
   cognitive psychological perspective and focused on the
   attending/perceiving and interpreting/reasoning facets of noticing. Few
   studies used video-based software and few studies used grouping, and
   even fewer used randomized grouping. Evidence of program effects on
   responding and decision making, and on instructional practice, is
   limited and should be extended in the future.},

Abstract = {The inclusion of alternative and multimodal methods for online
   interaction and knowledge construction in mathematics teacher education
   is still an incipient field. In this paper, we present a multiple case
   study of three blended courses in an elementary mathematics teacher
   education program at Western University. In these blended courses, the
   online component included the construction of collaborative mind maps.
   Through constructivist grounded theory methods, we analyzed teacher
   candidates' mind maps as (a) final products, and (b) interaction
   processes. The resulting theory describes how pre-service mathematics
   teachers interact and construct knowledge while they engage in online
   collaborative mind mapping. The study provides insights into the ways
   that collaborative and multimodal technologies affect mathematics
   teacher education, and in turn, suggests how its implementation may be
   improved.},

Title = {Word problems in mathematics education: a survey},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Word problems are among the most difficult kinds of problems that
   mathematics learners encounter. Perhaps as a result, they have been the
   object of a tremendous amount research over the past 50 years. This
   opening article gives an overview of the research literature on word
   problem solving, by pointing to a number of major topics, questions, and
   debates that have dominated the field. After a short introduction, we
   begin with research that has conceived word problems primarily as
   problems of comprehension, and we describe the various ways in which
   this complex comprehension process has been conceived theoretically as
   well as the empirical evidence supporting different theoretical models.
   Next we review research that has focused on strategies for actually
   solving the word problem. Strengths and weaknesses of informal and
   formal solution strategies-at various levels of learners' mathematical
   development (i.e., arithmetic, algebra)-are discussed. Fourth, we
   address research that thinks of word problems as exercises in complex
   problem solving, requiring the use of cognitive strategies (heuristics)
   as well as metacognitive (or self-regulatory) strategies. The fifth
   section concerns the role of graphical representations in word problem
   solving. The complex and sometimes surprising results of research on
   representations-both self-made and externally provided ones-are
   summarized and discussed. As in many other domains of mathematics
   learning, word problem solving performance has been shown to be
   significantly associated with a number of general cognitive resources
   such as working memory capacity and inhibitory skills. Research focusing
   on the role of these general cognitive resources is reviewed afterwards.
   The seventh section discusses research that analyzes the complex
   relationship between (traditional) word problems and (genuine)
   mathematical modeling tasks. Generally, this research points to the gap
   between the artificial word problems learners encounter in their
   mathematics lessons, on the one hand, and the authentic mathematical
   modeling situations with which they are confronted in real life, on the
   other hand. Finally, we review research on the impact of three important
   elements of the teaching/learning environment on the development of
   learners' word problem solving competence: textbooks, software, and
   teachers. It is shown how each of these three environmental elements may
   support or hinder the development of learners' word problem solving
   competence. With this general overview of international research on the
   various perspectives on this complex and fascinating kind of
   mathematical problem, we set the scene for the empirical contributions
   on word problems that appear in this special issue.},

Abstract = {In this article I describe an approach to task design and implementation
   that addresses the broad capabilities common to 21st Century Skills and
   the STEM education agenda. Principles of task design and implementation
   were co-constructed by ten teachers and a single researcher during a
   longitudinal study that took place over 3 years. A vignette that draws
   on observation data from a Year 1 class and a post-lesson teacher
   interview is used to illustrate the possibilities that exist for
   mathematics to support critical reasoning and enquiry in primary
   science. The article concludes with a reflection on the role of teachers
   in designing and implementing tasks aimed at promoting effective STEM
   teaching and learning.},

Title = {Metacognitive instructional behaviours of preschool teachers in

Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {An effective learning environment can be provided when teachers adopt
   metacognition-based teaching as a part of their course instructions. A
   well-developed metacognitive teaching approach can effectively develop
   students' problem-solving strategies. In addition to that contribution,
   it can provide opportunities for students to notice their own strengths
   and weaknesses together. Therefore, awareness of metacognitive processes
   should be passed on to students. The purpose of this study is to reveal
   what metacognitive strategies are adopted by preschool teachers while
   implementing mathematical activities, to examine their behaviours
   regarding these strategies, and to investigate how they structure the
   instruction. The research was constructed as a case study. The data were
   collected from 15 participating preschool teachers. A semi-structured
   observation form was used to collect the data. The data collection tool
   consisted of five dimensions and 24 sub-dimensions concerning aspects of
   metacognition. Mathematical activities of the participants were tracked
   by a researcher, and instructional behaviours of the participants were
   documented in accordance with items in the form. A descriptive analysis
   was carried out to examine the major characteristics of the dataset. The
   results indicated that preschool teachers demonstrate some
   metacognition-based behaviours. However, they do not adequately perform
   metacognitive skills. This evokes the idea that the teachers do not have
   adequate knowledge of metacognition. Hence, it is suggested that
   in-service training or some courses on metacognition-based teaching
   should be provided for teachers to increase their awareness.},

Abstract = {This paper illustrates how the academic literacy in mathematics
   framework (Moschkovich, J Math Behav 40:43-62, 2015) can be used to
   uncover the multiple layers of work bilingual learners accomplish during
   mathematical discussions. Using this framework allows researchers to
   examine students' joint mathematical activity in terms of mathematical
   proficiency, mathematical practices, and mathematical discourse. The use
   of the framework is illustrated through analysis of two mathematical
   discussions among middle school students. We conclude with reflections
   on the utility of the framework and consider possible pedagogical
   implications of this work.},

Title = {Does schooling actually perpetuate educational inequality in mathematics
   performance? A validity question on the measures of opportunity to learn
   in PISA},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {International assessments of mathematics have shown persistent and
   widely intensified socioeconomic inequalities in achievement worldwide
   over the last decades. Such achievement gaps may partly be due to the
   differences in students' personal and family characteristics. They may
   also be attributed to the schooling itself if school systems provide
   differentiated opportunity to learn (OTL) for children from privileged
   versus disadvantaged backgrounds. Previous research on the mechanism of
   the joint relationship among socioeconomic status (SES), academic
   achievement, and OTL produced inconclusive results. The main aim of the
   present study is to test whether schooling actually perpetuates social
   inequality in achievement, by reanalyzing PISA data. Specifically, we
   scrutinize the construct validity of the OTL measure in PISA that has
   been used in previous research. Our analyses reveal two latent
   dimensions of the OTL indicators in PISA, namely an unbiased OTL
   dimension and a self-concept dimension. The relationship between social
   background and mathematics achievement was only weakly mediated by OTL,
   when effect of students' self-concept was controlled for. Our results
   suggest that the previous research finding that schooling perpetuates
   social gaps in mathematics performance suffers from a construct validity
   problem.},

Title = {Conceptualizations of professional knowledge for teachers of mathematics},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {601-612},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Different conceptualizations exist about the components of the knowledge
   teachers need to teach mathematics with professional consciousness, and
   a researcher needs to describe and assess that knowledge. The fact,
   however, is that different conceptualizations respond to different
   needs, and thus, the variety is even a chance to develop the field
   further, the field of mathematics-related knowledge for teachers and for
   teaching. This paper sketches basic ideas of selected theoretical
   approaches, their goals, their fields of application, and their methods.
   First, three quite influential projects are introduced: The ``Michigan
   Project{''} (US), ``COACTIV{''} (Germany), and ``TEDS-M{''}
   (international). Then three conceptualizations with particular
   approaches are presented: ``Mathematics-for-Teaching{''} (Canada),
   Rowland's ``Knowledge Quartet{''} (UK), and Lindmeier's ``Structure
   Model{''} (Germany). The paper closes with some remarks concerning
   horizons: The first remark points to the restriction of all models of
   evaluating teachers' professional knowledge, namely, the everlasting gap
   between the knowledge per se and the need for acting in the classroom.
   The second remark reads the recently discussed idea of theory-building
   as a somewhat neglected aspect of professional knowledge. Thirdly, I
   discuss briefly how far the seminal CK/PCK distinction could really be
   an appropriate way into perceiving teachers' professional knowledge.
   Finally, I close with a few words on the need not to forget the policy
   issues of our work. The basic overall idea of the paper is to
   create-within the limited space-a sufficiently broad spectrum of the
   issue itself, and what was done in recent years to find a basis for
   research into teachers' knowledge as a salient issue for the effective
   teaching of mathematics.},

Abstract = {Considering that learning belongs primarily to the student, student
   self-regulation capacity is essential to ensure mathematics learning.
   Poor self-regulation limits students' mathematical performance and their
   ability to participate fully in classroom discourse. By enhancing
   self-regulation it is possible to improve students' equitable
   participation in mathematics. In this paper, we present a study aimed at
   understanding the development of the self-regulation capacity of middle
   school students in mathematics, throughout an observed teaching
   intervention, in which is developed regular work to promote
   internalisation of the assessment criteria, whole-class mathematics
   discussions regulated by social norms and the assessment criteria, and
   written self-assessments tasks. Following qualitative research
   methodology, data collection sources were classroom observation,
   interviews, questionnaires, and collection of documents. Data analysis
   had a strong interpretive foundation, making use of a system of
   categories defined during the process, based on the theoretical
   framework. Throughout the teaching intervention, students walked towards
   the internalisation of the assessment criteria, improved their
   performance in collective discussions, and developed their
   self-regulation capacity, following an individualized and non-linear
   pathway. Although equity concerns were partially addressed, the
   development of self-regulation capacity was not consistent in all
   students. This suggests that more could have be done to provide quality
   mathematics education for each and every student.},

Title = {Assessing individual lessons using a generic teacher observation

Abstract = {Teacher effectiveness, which impacts student attainment even when
   controlling for student characteristics, is of key importance as a
   factor in educational effectiveness and improvement. Improving the
   quality of teaching is thus the primary means by which we can enhance
   student learning outcomes. Thus there has long been great interest in
   the development of classroom observation measures in the field of
   educational effectiveness research (EER). The International System for
   Teacher Observation and Feedback (ISTOF) is a unique instrument in the
   field, as it was developed by a team from 20 countries using an
   iterative Delphi process to ensure cross-cultural relevance and
   validity. While previous studies have looked at psychometric properties
   of the instrument, they have not interrogated the extent to which ISTOF
   is useful for evaluating individual lessons and providing feedback to
   teachers. In this study, we observed three grade 4 mathematics lessons
   taken from the NCTE video library at Harvard University for this
   purpose. Findings show that ISTOF can provide a highly differentiated
   and fine-grained picture of individual lessons, but that the strengths
   of the generic approach in terms of breadth are to an extent
   counterbalanced by limitations such as the lack of attention to content
   richness.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of the offer of available educational resources raises
   the issue of their appropriation by teachers. Although the term
   appropriation is widely used in mathematics education research, there is
   no clear conceptualization allowing researchers to understand the
   processes involved. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by
   proposing a model for studying appropriation of curricular resources by
   teachers. This model was elaborated drawing on conceptualizations of
   appropriation in social and management sciences and on the instrumental
   approach. It was then put to the test in an empirical study involving
   one kindergarten teacher who was offered a digital game for teaching and
   learning enumeration, in order to build and enact a teaching sequence
   using the game. The model is used as a framework for analysing the
   interactions between the teacher and the resource during the teaching
   sequence preparation and its enactment. Such analysis enables the
   highlighting of the teacher's transformations of the resource, aiming at
   adapting it to his needs and to the context of his classroom
   (instrumentalization), his choices of instrumental orchestration, as
   well as the evolution of his professional knowledge and practice
   (instrumentation).},

Abstract = {Formative assessment has been identified as a promising intervention to
   support students' learning. How to successfully implement this means of
   assessment, however, is still an open issue. This study contributes to
   the implementation of formative assessment by analyzing the impact of a
   training measure on teachers' formative feedback practice, with a
   special focus on mediating and moderating variables. Research questions
   are as follows: (1) Is there an indirect training effect on teachers'
   instructional feedback practice via (a) teachers' declarative feedback
   knowledge and (b) the ability to generate feedback in a test situation?
   (2) Is this indirect effect moderated by teachers' self-efficacy? A
   total of 67 secondary education mathematics teachers participated in the
   study, taking part in professional development either on formative
   assessment and feedback (PD-FA) or on mathematical modelling and problem
   solving (PD-PM). Training was provided in two sessions (T1 and T2; each
   lasting 3 days) with 10 weeks in between T1 and T2. Teachers'
   self-efficacy regarding feedback was measured before T1 with a
   questionnaire. Declarative feedback knowledge and the ability to apply
   this knowledge were tested after T2. Teachers' instructional feedback
   practice was assessed with a student questionnaire (before T1 and 4-6
   weeks after T2). Path analyses show that (1) there is no indirect
   training effect (PD-FA vs. PD-PM) on the development of teachers'
   feedback practices in mathematics instruction; but an indirect effect on
   the ability to generate feedback in a test situation via teachers'
   declarative feedback knowledge. Teachers participating in PD-FA show a
   higher level of declarative feedback knowledge than teachers in the
   PD-PM condition. Declarative feedback knowledge in turn is positively
   related to the ability to generate feedback in a test situation. (2)
   This indirect effect is moderated by teachers' self-efficacy. Teachers
   with a high level of self-efficacy are better able to use their
   knowledge to generate feedback in a test situation than teachers with a
   low level of self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {A number of myths about mathematically gifted students, mathematics
   itself, and programs designed to serve these students tend to inhibit
   educators, parents and students themselves from developing students'
   mathematical creativity, expertise and enjoyment. This paper discusses
   some of the myths that can discourage students' mathematical
   development, restrict their understanding of mathematics, and/or are
   well-intentioned solutions with unintended consequences and includes
   research results from a few mathematics programs and other studies
   designed to counteract these myths and maximize students' mathematical

Abstract = {In this article, we present a narrative review of mathematics education
   research on language and on communication over 2019-2022, but also look
   ahead by addressing challenges posed by the lack of distinction between
   language and communication. The persistence and significance of the
   problem of the distinction between language and communication are thus
   outlined in a historical moment of celebration of growth of research in
   the domain. Informed by the analysis of a selection of research journal
   articles and by our trajectories, we discuss influential topics in the
   recent discourse: multilingual mathematics classrooms; mathematics
   teacher education on language in mathematics teaching; multimodal
   mathematical communication; interaction and mathematics learning;
   mathematical language and discourse. We connect this with new emerging
   or old revisited concepts: instructional designing, gesturing,
   argumenting and languaging. We finish by further reflecting on
   multimodal mathematical communication and gesturing, and on the
   potential of expanding the notion of mathematics register towards a
   notion of mathematics communication register.},

Abstract = {In 1908, Felix Klein suggested that to mend the discontinuity that
   prospective secondary teachers face, university instruction must account
   for teachers' needs. More than a century later, problems of
   discontinuity remain. Our project addresses the dilemma of discontinuity
   in university mathematics courses through simulating core teaching
   practices in mathematically intensive ways. In other words, we interpret
   teachers' needs to include integrating content and pedagogy. We argue
   that doing so has the potential to impact teachers' competence. To make
   this argument, we report findings from the Mathematics of Doing,
   Understanding, Learning, and Educating for Secondary Schools
   (MODULE(S2)) project. The results are based on data from 324 prospective
   secondary mathematics teachers (PSMTs) enrolled in courses using
   curricular materials developed by the project in four content areas
   (algebra, geometry, modeling, and statistics). We operationalized
   competence in terms of PSMTs' content knowledge for teaching and their
   motivation for enacting core teaching practices. We examined pre- and
   post-term data addressing these constructs. We found mean increases in
   PSMTs' outcomes in content knowledge for teaching and aspects of
   motivation.},

Title = {Supporting adults to become numerate citizens: a study of adult numeracy

Abstract = {This paper revisits and reanalyses data from a study carried out in the
   further education and training sector in the Republic of Ireland to
   investigate (1) how adults access and participate in numeracy courses
   and (2) how adult numeracy provision might support active citizenship.
   We analysed 45 interviews with adult education providers, adult numeracy
   tutors, and adult learners to identify themes that connect adult
   numeracy with a human rights conception of citizenship as access to and
   participation in economic, social, and community life. This analysis
   found that the most common barriers to accessing adult numeracy courses
   arose from dispositional factors relating to fear, anxiety and lack of
   confidence with mathematics, largely due to negative experiences in
   formal schooling. To overcome these barriers, adults' participation in
   numeracy courses was encouraged by integrating numeracy learning
   activities into real world contexts in a non-threatening learning
   environment. The interview analysis also illustrated ways in which adult
   numeracy education supported active citizenship in the economic, social,
   and community spheres, by (i) enhancing financial literacy and preparing
   adults for employment; (ii) fostering individual empowerment, family
   learning and social inclusion; and (iii) enabling civic engagement.
   Policies for promoting adult education typically aim to develop active
   citizenship, but without specifying how this is to be achieved. Our
   study is valuable because it illuminates potential connections between
   citizenship and numeracy as a dimension of adult education that is
   separate from literacy. The findings lead to recommendations for
   translating national and international policy frameworks into
   research-informed adult education programs.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the evolution of prospective secondary teachers'
   knowledge (meanings for dy/dt) and beliefs (about teaching and learning
   mathematics) in a semester-long inquiry-oriented differential equations
   class. Students entered the course with limited, primarily procedural,
   meanings ford y/dt . Throughout the semester, they engaged in
   collaborative mathematical inquiry using a research-based curriculum. As
   viewed through the emergent perspective, students' meanings for dy/dt
   and their beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics co-evolved
   with community norms and practices through the classroom discourse.
   Students' end-of-term portfolios and portfolio presentations were
   analyzed for evidence of meanings for dy/dt and beliefs about students'
   roles, instructors' roles, and the general nature of learning
   mathematics. In these, students expressed rich, multifaceted meanings
   for dy/dt and beliefs about learning as an active process of
   meaning-making. While many prospective teachers do not see the relevance
   of advanced mathematics coursework to their career, these students
   reflected on their experiences in the course and volunteered ways in
   which their emerging knowledge and beliefs would influence their future
   practice. We emphasize that the classroom norms supported students in
   pursuing connections themselves, and conjecture that similar norms would
   support the development of reflective practitioners in other contexts.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of mathematics in physics makes people take for
   granted the intimate connection between both disciplines. However,
   history shows that this is not always the case, because mathematics has
   played a minor role, not only in Aristotelian physics in ancient Greece,
   but also in Confucian and neo-Confucian science in ancient China. The
   objective of this study is to discuss the role of mathematics in physics
   and propose a structuralistic view as an epistemological stance to
   interpret this role. This paper opens with a brief historical overview
   on the relationship between mathematics and physics, followed by a
   report on Taiwanese college students' work on and responses to an
   activity simulating Galileo's inclined plane experiment, in order to
   investigate in what way they analyzed the data and to what extent this
   activity enriched the affective, knowledge-oriented, and historical
   aspects of their thinking. Additionally, an investigation of a
   mathematician's and a physicist's beliefs was conducted to search for an
   epistemological stance that reveals the relationship between mathematics
   and physics. The study suggests that a structuralist view may be
   appropriate for promoting students' learning and their epistemological
   interpretations of mathematics and physics.},

Abstract = {This manuscript contributes to research on how algebraic thinking about
   operations and properties can develop, and relevant forms of curricular
   activity. The key question asked is: how can students' early algebraic
   activity be fostered through focusing on relations involving operations
   and properties? We adopt Radford's three aspects of algebraic thinking
   (indeterminacy, denotation and analyticity), which focus on considering,
   symbolising and operating on unknown objects. We investigate the work of
   a class of 11-12 year old students in re-analysing data collected over
   20 years ago as part of a project exploring algebraic activity. Our
   findings point to the proposal that a focus on conjecturing about
   relationships can be a powerful route into early algebra. On the basis
   of our analysis we propose an extension to Radford's third aspect of
   algebraic thinking (analyticity) to include structuring a mathematical
   space, e.g., through a set of conjectures.},

Abstract = {In this paper we consider implications of the current world-wide
   inclusion of computational thinking in relation to children's
   development of algebraic thinking. Little is known about how newly
   developed visual programming environments such as Scratch could enhance
   early algebra learning. The study is based on examples of programming
   activities used by mathematics teachers in Sweden, teaching students
   aged 10-12 years during the first two years of implementing programming
   in the mathematics curriculum. Informed by Chevallard's praxeology in
   terms of praxis and logos, we describe, unpack, discuss and expand these
   activities. Core issues related to algebra found in the three activities
   are as follows: making implicit variables explicit; using a counter
   variable; and identifying parameters as a specific type of variable. Our
   findings show that, in addition to already identified uses of variables
   in early algebra, programming activities in the early years bring in new
   aspects and new ways of treating variables that could, potentially,
   enhance students' understanding of variables and generalization,
   provided that programming praxis is embedded in an appropriate algebra
   logos.},

Abstract = {With this article, we aim to spur a conversation on research
   implementation in the context of collaborations of mathematics teachers
   and educational researchers, with a special interest in projects
   situated in university mathematics education. Implementation has been
   often discussed in relation to the education of school teachers, and we
   suggest that the conceptual, theoretical, and analytical apparatus that
   has been developed in this research area can be re-purposed to study
   implementation. Specifically, we propose that in collaborative projects,
   implementation can be construed as an interactive change-oriented
   process, in which teachers and researchers develop their praxeologies
   through interaction and joint work on boundary objects. We illustrate
   the usefulness of this proposal with a teacher-mathematician and a
   mathematics education researcher who joined forces to introduce
   scriptwriting activities into an undergraduate mathematics course.
   Drawing on the theoretical analysis and illustration, we make
   suggestions for future implementation studies in the context of
   teacher-researcher collaborations.},

Title = {Growth of professional noticing of mathematics teachers: a comparative
   study of Chinese teachers noticing with different teaching experiences},

Abstract = {The last decade has witnessed increasing interest in the study of
   teacher noticing in mathematics education research; however, little is
   known about the growth of teacher noticing and how it is influenced by
   teaching practice. Departing from the expert-novice-paradigm, in this
   paper we address this research gap by a cross-sectional study that
   investigates how Chinese mathematics teachers' noticing is affected by
   their developmental stage, measured by the length of their teaching
   experience. The study included 152 pre-service teachers at the end of
   their initial teacher education, 162 early career teachers with one to
   five years' teaching experience, and 123 experienced mathematics
   teachers with more than 15 years' teaching experience, who participated
   in a video-based assessment of their noticing competency conceptualized
   by the sub-facets of perception, interpretation, and decision-making.
   Our findings indicate a nearly linear growth in teacher noticing among
   Chinese mathematics teachers, with significant differences identified
   between pre-service and experienced teachers and only small differences
   between pre-service and early career teachers. Analyses using the method
   of Differential Item Functioning (DIF) further suggest that pre-service
   and early career teachers demonstrated strengths in aspects more related
   to reform-oriented or Westernized approaches to mathematics teaching,
   such as working with open-ended tasks, identifying characteristics of
   cooperative learning, and mathematical modeling tasks. By contrast,
   experienced teachers demonstrated strengths in perceiving students'
   thinking, evaluating teachers' behavior, and analyzing students'
   mathematical thinking. Our findings further highlight that the three
   sub-facets of teacher noticing develop differently within the three
   participating groups of teachers. These findings suggest that teaching
   experience acts as one influential factor in the development of teacher
   noticing in the Chinese context.},

Abstract = {This article undertakes a reframing of the concept of teacher knowledge.
   It argues that in order to help teachers create more powerful learning
   environments, a much more general framing is required-one that
   incorporates a teacher's perceptions, inclinations and orientations as
   well as their understandings and related proficiencies. A main point of
   departure is the Teaching for Robust Understanding (TRU) framework,
   which focuses on essential dimensions of classroom practice. Questions
   of teacher knowledge are reframed as: ``How can we reconceptualize
   teacher knowledge (perhaps better, teacher proficiency) so that it
   encompasses the broad range of perceptions, orientations, understandings
   and proficiencies that support teachers in crafting learning
   environments from which students emerge as knowledgeable, flexible, and
   resourceful thinkers and problem solvers? How can it be organized so
   that it can be worked on productively? This paper explores these issues.
   It employs the TRU framework as the initial mechanism for reframing,
   while drawing on Schoenfeld's (How we think. Routledge, New York, 2010)
   work on teachers' decision making and Schoenfeld and Kilpatrick's
   (International handbook of mathematics teacher education, volume 2:
   tools and processes in mathematics teacher education. Sense Publishers,
   Rotterdam, pp 321-354, 2008) work on teacher proficiency to suggest what
   should be included in an expanded framing of teacher knowledge.},

Abstract = {In this study we investigated the development of 245 kindergarteners'
   mathematics problem solving (MPS) at two time points within 7 months
   using a cognitive diagnostic test, which measured three cognitive
   components (mathematical knowledge and skills, semantic understanding,
   and quantitative reasoning) with eleven cognitive attributes. The
   effects of five influencing factors {[}language ability, mathematics
   application ability, calculation ability, approaches to learning (ATL)
   and socio-economic status (SES)] on the children's MPS ability at the
   two time points were examined. The results indicated that the 245
   children's mastery of mathematical knowledge and skills was much better
   than their mastery of semantic understanding and quantitative reasoning.
   Furthermore, they achieved significant progress in set comparison and
   addition and subtraction within the range of natural numbers to ten (two
   of the three cognitive attributes of mathematical knowledge and skills),
   additive composition reasoning and one-to-many correspondence reasoning
   (two of the three cognitive attributes of quantitative reasoning). Only
   their mathematics application ability significantly predicted their
   mastery of the three cognitive components of MPS ability at the two-time
   points. Their language and calculation abilities predicted only their
   mastery of mathematical knowledge and skills at the two time points.
   Their ATL predicted their mastery of the three cognitive components of
   MPS only at the first time point, and their SES predicted only their
   mastery of semantic understanding 7 months later.},

Abstract = {Students in the elementary grades often experience difficulty setting up
   and solving word problems. Using an equation to represent the structure
   of the problem serves as an effective tool for solving word problems,
   but students may require specific pre-algebraic reasoning instruction
   about the equal sign as a relational symbol to set up and solve such
   equations successfully. We identified students with mathematics
   difficulty (n = 138) from a sample of 916 third-grade students. We
   randomly assigned students to a word-problem intervention with a
   pre-algebraic reasoning component, a word-problem intervention without
   pre-algebraic reasoning, or the business-as-usual. Students in the 2
   active intervention conditions participated in 45 individual sessions
   and learned about 3 additive word-problem schemas. Students who received
   word-problem intervention with a pre-algebraic reasoning component
   demonstrated improved nonstandard equation solving, equal sign
   understanding, and word-problem solving compared to students in the
   other two conditions.},

Abstract = {In this article we outline the role evidence and argument plays in the
   construction of a framing theory for Proof Based Teaching of basic
   operations on natural numbers and integers, which uses tiles to
   physically represent numbers. We adopt Mariotti's characterization of a
   mathematical theorem as a triple of statement, proof and theory, and
   elaborate a theory in which the statement ``The product of two negative
   integers is a positive integer{''} can be proved. This theory is
   described in terms of a `toolbox' of accepted statements, and acceptable
   forms of argumentation and expression. We discuss what counts as
   mathematical evidence in this theory and how that evidence is used in
   mathematical arguments that support the theory.},

Title = {The role of reflexivity in the emergence and expression of teachers'

Abstract = {The advent of a democratically-elected government in South Africa in
   1994 disrupted the erstwhile synchrony between the schooling system,
   teacher education system, curriculum and pedagogy. Yet many South
   African teachers continue to express their teacher identities much like
   they did prior to 1994. The explanations posited for why this is the
   case tend to focus on systemic arguments. Notwithstanding their
   importance, these arguments render teachers as products of the social
   system. In this paper, it is argued that reflexivity is central to the
   emergence and expression of teachers' identities. Reflexivity refers to
   the mental capacity to consider oneself in relation to one's social
   contexts and visa versa. The modes of reflexivity of a grade 3 teacher
   are examined to demonstrate how she mediates the social structures that
   condition the emergence and expression of her primary mathematics
   teacher identity. Drawing on a social realist analysis of narrative data
   and classroom observations, the paper traces her identity historically
   into the present. The paper suggests that over the years her concerns in
   the world, and modes of reflexivity, have changed. These are key to
   understanding the decisions she makes in the classroom and how she deals
   with the social structures that condition the manner in which she
   expresses her role as teacher, that is, her primary mathematics teacher
   identity. The shift in her primary mathematics teacher identity has led
   to her reproducing the old roles of the teacher as exemplified in the
   pre-1994 curriculum. While the paper is located in the South African
   context, the implications for teacher education have international
   significance.},

Abstract = {This article examines collaborative mathematical tasks that entail
   sympathetic coordinated movements. We discuss the affective bonds that
   form when students participate in such tasks. Using Maxine
   Sheets-Johnstone's term ``affectivity{''} to characterize the responsive
   nature of bodies, we analyse data from a teaching experiment where
   students collaboratively explore the dynamic aspects of mathematical
   figures. We work with the ancient Greek concept of `sympathy' to study
   the complex ways that multi-body assemblages actively coordinate their
   movements in the midst of a mathematical task. We include here diverse
   kinds of often imperceptible body movement (gesture, face, eye, foot,
   etc), and discuss how mathematical concepts are assembled through such
   movements. Our analysis bridges three scales: (1) the
   micro-phenomenological scale of the pre-individual affect, (2) the
   individual scale of human movement, and (3) the transindividual scale of
   collective endeavours.},

Abstract = {Children have limited exposure to statistical concepts and processes,
   yet researchers have highlighted multiple benefits of experiences in
   which they design and/or engage informally with statistical modelling. A
   study was conducted with a classroom in which students developed and
   utilised data-based models to respond to the inquiry question, Which
   origami animal jumps the furthest? The students used hat plots and box
   plots in Tinkerplots to make sense of variability in comparing
   distributions of their data and to support them to write justified
   conclusions of their findings. The study relied on classroom video and
   student artefacts to analyse aspects of the students' modelling
   experiences which exposed them to powerful statistical ideas, such as
   key repeatable structures and dispositions in statistics. Three
   principlespurpose, process and predictionare highlighted as ways in
   which the problem context, statistical structures and inquiry
   dispositions and cycle extended students' opportunities to reason in
   sophisticated ways appropriate for their age. The research question
   under investigation was, How can an emphasis on purpose, process and
   prediction be implemented to support children's statistical modelling?
   The principles illustrated in the study may provide a simple framework
   for teachers and researchers to develop statistical modelling practices
   and norms at the school level.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a research-based mathematics curriculum program
   development project in Sweden, whose educational context is currently
   characterized by multiple reform initiatives. Current reforms include a
   repositioning of the teacher as central for students' learning, but also
   a trend toward initiatives and teacher resources that are more directive
   than has been the case in the past 30 years. Collecting data from
   multiple sources, such as teacher log books, lesson observations and
   feedback meetings, we build on input from 11 elementary school teachers
   trying out our materials, including student texts and a teachers' guide,
   during four trial rounds. We analyze how international research about
   curriculum programs and teachers' use of these programs are interpreted
   and operationalized within the Swedish context. In particular, the two
   research questions guiding the study are: (1) ``How do Swedish teachers
   interact with and reason about the reform-based classroom practices
   promoted by the curriculum program?{''} and (2) ``How do Swedish
   teachers interact with and reason about their use of a teachers'
   guide?{''} From our experiences in the Swedish educational context, we
   suggest the following contextual aspects to take into account when
   designing a curriculum program whose design is grounded in international
   research literature: characteristics of current classroom practices,
   teachers' role in classrooms, the level of explicit/implicit support
   teachers are used to receiving, and teachers' experiences using a
   teachers' guide.},

Abstract = {The notion of mathematical modelling has multiple interpretations in
   research literature and has been included in curriculum documents in
   various ways. This study presents a thematic analysis of nine
   professional modellers' conceptions of the notion of mathematical
   modelling, representing scholarly knowledge. The result is organised
   according to four main aspects of modelling, that is description,
   understanding, abstraction and negotiation, representing key features of
   mathematical models and how people are affected by, or engage in,
   modelling work. The paper concludes with a discussion of some potential
   benefits for mathematics education that might be drawn from the study
   from the perspective of the `gap' between mathematical modelling in
   educational and non-educational contexts, in terms of curriculum design
   and teaching practice.},

Abstract = {The use of digital tools in mathematics lessons has recently gained in
   significance, especially because of ongoing technical developments.
   Particularly in the context of mathematical modelling, digital tools
   have become more and more important. They have been deployed for many
   years and are currently being intensively discussed from a didactical
   point of view. This paper discusses to what extent modelling processes
   using digital tools can be described theoretically, and surveys
   significant empirical findings in this field. Based on a quantitative
   control study with 709 students, we especially investigated the
   competence of mathematising. We compared the competence development of a
   test-group that worked with digital tools, to a control-group that
   worked with paper and pencil on the same tasks during a four-lesson
   intervention on geometric modelling tasks. We find a comparable
   improvement of mathematising in both groups. This competence development
   was also investigated in relation to the influence of attitudes towards
   the software used and program-related self-efficacy. We find
   program-related self-efficacy, but not attitudes towards the used
   software, to be a significant predictor of the gain in competency. These
   results are discussed with respect to different performance studies
   examining the use of dynamic geometry software.},

Abstract = {This study investigated how 38 secondary mathematics prospective
   teachers modified textbook tasks for convergent and divergent thinking
   while learning to teach mathematics during university coursework. The
   coursework focused prospective teachers' attention on their analyses of
   textbook tasks in terms of potential affordances and constraints for
   creativity education and implementation of textbook task modification
   and micro-teaching. Prospective teachers were asked to consider studies
   from general perspectives on creativity education, studies on enhancing
   creativity by increasing or maintaining levels of cognitive demands in
   tasks, and studies about encouraging creativity thinking by facing and
   dealing with ambiguity or pathologies and misconceptions when modifying
   textbook tasks and micro-teaching. Findings indicated that prospective
   teachers had different types of textbook task modification for
   creativity education that fell into four categories: no meaningful
   change, blind variability, orthodoxy, and creativity. In addition,
   prospective teachers actively linked theory and practice centered on
   textbook tasks and textbook task modification for creativity education
   and the citations to which they referred varied according to the task
   quadrant into which their textbook task modification was categorized.},

Abstract = {In Canada, as in other Western countries, solving word problems has
   comprised an important part of mathematics curricula. Traditionally,
   arithmetic thinking has largely been privileged as the main strategy for
   solving word problems at the elementary level, thus postponing the
   introduction of algebraic thinking to the secondary school. Drawing on
   the work of the Russian psychologist Davydov, we suggest that algebraic
   ways of thinking can be fostered as early as primary grades within the
   context of problem solving, thus enabling understanding of relational
   aspects of a problem's mathematical structure. In particular, we used
   Elkonin and Davydov's notion of learning activity to design a
   computer-based task that helps young students (ages 7-8) to analyse word
   problems and eventually engage in an algebraic way of thinking. The task
   also involves a whole-class discussion in which students probe their
   understanding of the problem and model its solution in a relational way,
   instead of instantly locking themselves into a numerical operation.
   Macro- and micro-levels of analyses were conducted using, inter alia,
   the lens of the didactical tetrahedron, which highlights the association
   between design of learning tasks and students' capacity building in
   analysing and expressing relationships between quantities through
   non-numerical symbols. While further research on the relational approach
   is still needed, this paper demonstrates its potential to contribute to
   progressively shifting young children's understanding from one that
   relies heavily on arithmetic processes toward one that builds on
   algebraic thinking.},

Abstract = {Positive and negative emotions are ubiquitous in everyday school life,
   and can foster or impair processes of learning and achievement. However,
   learning- and achievement-related emotions are not based solely on
   experiences from respective situations in the school context. Rather,
   experiences outside of school, e.g. learning at home, are also
   important. The present study focused on the importance of perceived
   parental support for children's enjoyment of learning in the subject of
   mathematics. We were interested in the following two characteristics of
   perceived parental support: perceived parental control, in the sense of
   intrusive parental support, and perceived parental structure, in the
   sense of clarity of parents' learning-related expectations. The central
   question concerned the predictive effects of intraindividual changes in
   perceived parental control and perceived parental structure with respect
   to intraindividual changes in enjoyment of learning. This issue was
   tested by means of a latent change model. Data were analyzed of 396
   children (six measurement time points from the sixth to the eighth
   school year). The results showed the expected indirect positive effects
   of intraindividual changes in perceived parental structure, and indirect
   negative effects of intraindividual changes in perceived parental
   control, with regard to intraindividual changes in enjoyment of
   learning. In both cases, intraindividual changes in control beliefs and
   value beliefs acted as mediating variables.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a part of a larger study, in which we asked ``How
   are learning and teaching of mathematics at high level linked to
   students' general giftedness?{''} We consider asking questions,
   especially studentgenerated questions, as indicators of quality of
   instructional interactions. In the part of the study presented in this
   paper, we explore instructional interactions in two high-school classes
   for mathematically promising students with specific focus on questions
   that students ask. The first class included generally gifted students
   (IQ >= 130) who were motivated to study mathematics at a high level
   (hereafter, a gifted class), and the second class included students
   characterized by high motivation regardless of their IQs (hereafter,
   motivation class). We analysed questions asked by the students during
   algebra and geometry lessons. Two types of questions are considered:
   elaboration and clarification. We found that students in a gifted class
   mostly asked elaboration questions, whereas students in a motivation
   class mostly asked clarification questions. We connect the revealed
   inclination to ask elaboration questions with intellectual curiosity
   that characterizes generally gifted students. Accordingly, we suggest
   that in classes of students who are motivated to study mathematics at
   high level, students who are generally gifted may create mathematical
   discourse of higher quality. We also argue that the identified
   differences in students' questions observed in classes of different
   types are not only student-dependent (i.e. depend on the students'
   levels of general giftedness) but can also be teacher-related and
   content-related.},

Abstract = {We study the experts' practices developed with the support of digital
   technologies (DT), when they take aware in-the-moment decisions during
   classroom discussions to promote the development of effective formative
   assessment (FA) processes. In this investigation, we complement a
   macro-analysis of paradigmatic examples of classroom activities, focused
   on the functionalities of DT and on the implemented FA strategies, with
   a micro-analysis, developed with reference to a theoretical construct
   useful for interpreting and analysing expert teachers' roles during
   classroom discussions (the Model of Aware and Effective Attitudes and
   Behaviours, MAEAB). More specifically, we explore how the expert uses DT
   to empower these roles with the aim of promoting FA processes. This
   study has two implications: (1) at the theoretical level, the study will
   introduce a model aimed at characterising the ways in which the expert
   can promote FA during classroom discussions when they are mediated by
   the use of DT; (2) at the pragmatic level, the use of this model to
   analyse paradigmatic examples from teaching experiments will introduce
   potential guidelines for teacher professional development aimed at
   promoting teachers' autonomous use of DT to carry out effective FA
   practices.},

Title = {A review of lesson study in mathematics education from 2015 to 2022:
   implementation and impact},

Abstract = {Lesson study (LS), a teacher-oriented, student-focused professional
   development (PD) approach that originated in Japan, has spread globally.
   However, existing literature on the implementation of LS and its
   effectiveness provides inconsistent results, suggesting a need to review
   current research on LS. With a focus on LS in mathematics education, we
   examined 75 recent LS studies using Lewis's (ZDM Mathematics Education
   48:571-580, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11858-016-0792-x) framework
   to understand how LS is implemented and the pathways by which LS can
   impact teaching practice and student learning. We found that new
   developments have taken place in LS implementation, although challenges
   persist throughout its process. Regarding the implementation of LS, even
   though the examined LS studies generally contained four phases (study,
   plan, teach, and reflect), we found many LS lacked a research question,
   and the study of teaching materials was sometimes invisible. Across
   phases, studies shared a consensus that it is most critical to focus on
   students' thinking and learning, yet reported challenges in maintaining
   this focus. In addition, the role of knowledgeable others (KOs) was
   recognized but inconsistently understood. Collaboration was also widely
   reported as a challenge. Finally, there were large variations in LS
   duration, with some LS implementing overly brief cycles. Regarding LS
   impact, the literature has more frequently reported changes in teachers'
   knowledge and beliefs and less frequently in curriculum, learning
   community/professional norms, teaching practice, and student learning
   outcomes. The above challenges reflect a need for culturally relevant
   systemic support for developing sustainable and large-scale LS. We
   suggest future directions for continued research and practice
   improvement.},

   symmetries through a tangible geometric model. This approach has
   historical roots in the work of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program and his
   Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint. We situate our study
   with respect to this history as well as current educational research in
   spatial visual reasoning, abstract algebra, and teacher knowledge. Our
   findings highlight opportunities that tangible geometric models can
   provide for fostering structural and interconnected understanding

Abstract = {In the Hungarian ``Guided Discovery{''} approach to teaching
   mathematics, teachers' planning work plays a crucial role. Teachers
   following the approach develop teaching trajectories based on ``series
   of problems{''}. This work includes the choice, creation,
   transformation, organization and networking of problems with regard to
   various teaching objectives. However, most of this planning work remains
   implicit; the structure and rationale of the teaching trajectories are
   often inaccessible for an external observer (including, for example,
   student teachers). An ongoing project based on teacher-researcher
   collaboration aims to reveal the hidden characteristics and principles
   of teachers' work with series of problems through the creation of
   innovative resources for teachers. In this paper, we present the design
   of this collaborative work, a process we designate ``reverse
   engineering{''}, and analyse the development process of resources,
   focusing particularly on the emergence of new vocabulary and
   representation tools serving as mediators in the communication between
   teachers and researchers.},

Abstract = {After about two years of emergency remote teaching during the pandemic,
   the teaching of mathematics is slowly returning to (what used to be
   called) normal. However, after the period of mostly teaching online,
   there is uncertainty about the extent to which we will return to the way
   we were teaching before. In this survey paper we attempt to give some
   background to the impact that emergency remote teaching may have had on
   teaching mathematics. We examine the possible social implications and
   then focus on the changing mathematics classroom, focusing on the actual
   mathematics curriculum, learning design and assessment, the role of
   collaborative activities and social media, educational videos, and the
   role of family and parents in future. There are indicators from the
   literature that educators may not return to the traditional way of
   teaching entirely, especially in secondary and higher education. We
   conclude with describing some possible new research areas that have
   developed through emergency remote teaching, including online education
   for younger learners, local learning ecosystems, the role of family and
   parents, instructional design, and the mathematics content of curricula.},

Abstract = {Numerous preservice primary school teachers begin their training with a
   negative attitude towards mathematics: this phenomenon can have
   important consequences for their training path and for their future
   teaching. How teachers' training programs could affect preservice
   teachers' attitudes is one of the main issues in research on future
   teachers in the field of mathematics education. However, longitudinal
   studies developed during specific teacher development programs are still
   rare in the research field of teacher development. In this frame, this
   paper reports on the results of a longitudinal 2-year study carried out
   within the initial training of 35 preservice primary school teachers.
   According to the three-dimensional model of attitude towards
   mathematics, we developed the analysis of future teachers' emotional
   disposition towards mathematics, vision of mathematics, and perceived
   competence in mathematics, at the beginning of the training path and
   after 2 years. We found two main results on two different levels. First,
   a positive change in future teachers' attitude towards mathematics,
   generalized over all the three dimensions, occurred during the training
   period, and this result opens the issue of the relationship between
   formative choices and change in attitude. Second, our data confirm the
   strong relationship between the three dimensions of attitudes: every
   change in one dimension affects the other two dimensions.},

   elements de Geometrie (1741), a book presenting geometrical knowledge
   organized around problems, with rich metadiscourse connecting problems
   and other elements of mathematical content. This analysis is inspired
   both by the ``Series of problems at the crossroad of cultures{''}
   interdisciplinary history of sciences project, in which texts from
   various cultures structured around problems were analysed, and by
   ongoing mathematics educational research on the Hungarian Guided
   Discovery approach, where ``series of problems{''} play a central role
   in the planning and implementation of teaching trajectories. I show how
   a dialog between the analysis of Clairaut's historical text and
   mathematics educational research contributes to the reflection on the
   construction and analysis of inquiry based teaching trajectories in
   mathematics education.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the zoom in and zoom out approach to
   mathematics teacher education (ZIZO), which is intentionally designed to
   foster commognitive conflicts through the exploration of historical
   sources and the engagement with collective discussions. ZIZO is
   structured in three interconnected moments: firstly, participants are
   invited to immerse in primary sources, as a means of shaking their
   comfort zones regarding legitimate mathematical procedures and criteria;
   secondly, they engage in plenary discussions on the historical
   contextualisation of mathematical ideas, supported by the study of
   secondary sources; finally, they return to the source to unveil specific
   aspects of historical practices. This approach is part of a broader
   proposal, which builds upon participants' collective experiences to
   stimulate the development of a problematising stance toward knowledge
   production and teaching of mathematics. We exemplify ZIZO by a case in
   which the study of books I and II of Euclid's Elements was used to
   problematise usual approaches to the teaching of Pythagoras' theorem and
   areas in Brazilian secondary school. Our findings suggest that the
   engagement with Euclidean practices led teachers to problematise their
   views on the teaching of areas as geometrical magnitudes and as
   measurements, as well as the pedagogical uses of manipulable materials.
   These results highlight ZIZO's potential for teacher education,
   especially regarding the problematisation of views on what mathematics
   is and how it is learned and taught.},

Abstract = {Interest is vital for students' learning in mathematics. Over the course
   of the Chinese mathematics curriculum reform in the past 30 years,
   cultivating students' positive emotions, attitudes, and values has
   gained growing attention. In the current study we examined the
   trajectory of Chinese mathematics textbook development by analyzing
   textbook content that stimulated students' mathematics learning interest
   through the curriculum reform in the past three decades. First, we
   selected textbooks that represent each phase of the curriculum reform
   (the Incubation Phase, the Reform Phase, and the Conditioning Phase).
   Then, taking eighth grade as an example, we used Hidi and Renninger's
   model to identify content that focus on stimulating students' learning
   interest. Finally, we explored the trajectory of textbook development in
   this aspect within the scope of curriculum reform. Results show that
   attention to strategies developing positive emotions and values towards
   mathematics has been emerging in recent times. Interest-stimulating
   strategies directed toward the triggering and maintaining of situational
   interest have been integrated more frequently into textbooks since the
   Reform Phase, while text content employing strategies that may lead to
   rote memorization is generally decreasing. Using Chinese curriculum
   reform as a context, this study demonstrates how mathematics textbooks
   have been revisioned and revised with a focus on stimulating students'
   learning interest. The reform of mathematics education has been
   successfully implemented in more than thirty provinces in China, despite
   significant differences in geographical, cultural, and economic
   development. It is hoped that this study can provide practical evidence
   of interest stimulation in mathematics for the international education

Abstract = {Due to rapid social and economic development in China over the last
   three decades, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have
   become increasingly available in Chinese classrooms and families.
   However, there is a lack of research regarding Chinese students' use of
   ICTs in mathematics learning. In this study, we examined how Chinese
   students access, use, and perceive ICTs in learning mathematics. To this
   end, a conceptual framework for ICTs and the role of ICTs in students'
   learning of mathematics was established. Using a mixed-methods approach,
   we collected data from 223 students in four randomly selected secondary
   schools in Shanghai through a questionnaire survey, followed by
   classroom observations and interviews with students and teachers. The
   results revealed that various ICTs are widely accessible in Shanghai
   classrooms and students overall have a positive view about the role of
   ICTs in their mathematics learning, especially in problem solving and in
   learning geometry. When learning mathematics at home, students used
   handheld technological devices more frequently than non-portable
   devices. Furthermore, there were significant differences between
   different students in terms of school performance levels, grade levels,
   and genders in their use of ICTs in learning mathematics. In particular,
   students from high-performing schools had more access to various ICTs
   but used them less frequently than their peers from ordinary schools.
   Suggestions and implications of the findings are discussed at the end of
   the paper.},

Abstract = {The study presented in this paper concerns the design and evaluation of
   curriculum material that supports mathematics teachers' understanding
   and enactment of reform curricula and innovative teaching practices. Our
   focus is on curriculum material supporting mathematics teachers'
   practices combining the use of digital technology and the development of
   student autonomy. We refer to the theoretical framework of the
   Documentational Approach to Didactics, which considers teachers'
   documentation work as a central lever for the evolution of teachers'
   practices. Our study took place in the context of curriculum reforms in
   France, which called on teachers to combine the use of digital
   technology with the development of student autonomy in their practices.
   We investigate in this paper the design of a meta-resource with the aim
   of supporting teachers' documentation work in this context. The
   documentation work ranged from choosing a lesson plan offered on a
   website to designing a completely new lesson. Using a design research
   approach, we conducted two design and evaluation cycles, involving
   different groups of researchers and teachers, and we analysed these
   design processes and their outcomes. The researchers used particular
   categories to distinguish between different forms of autonomy, and
   criteria concerning the articulation between student autonomy and
   digital technologies. The teachers provided elements concerning the
   features of a lesson plan facilitating its appropriation, and more
   generally related to their actual design work. Our results illustrate
   how a multidisciplinary team of researchers can collaborate with
   teachers to design `meta-resources' supporting teachers' documentation
   work in a context of education reform.},

Abstract = {Problem solving and problem posing have long been of interest to the
   mathematics education community. In this survey paper we first look at
   some of the seminal moments in the history of research on the important
   topics. We then use this history to position the state-of-the-art
   research being done in both problem solving and problem posing, before
   introducing the presented state-of-the-art developments in problem
   solving and problem posing. We then use this work as a backdrop against
   which to introduce the 16 empirical papers that make up this special
   issue. Together these 16 papers add nuance to what is already known
   about problem solving and problem posing; this nuance is the result of
   attending to very specific contexts and purposes in which these
   activities are embedded. We end the paper by discussing the future
   directions these fields can take.},

Abstract = {We argue that examples can do more than serve the purpose of
   illustrating the truth of an existential statement or disconfirming the
   truth of a universal statement. Our argument is relevant to the use of
   technology in classroom assessment. A central challenge of
   computer-assisted assessment is to develop ways of collecting rich and
   complex data that can nevertheless be analyzed automatically. We report
   here on a study concerning a dedicated design pattern of a special kind
   of task for assessing student's reasoning when establishing the validity
   of geometry statements that go beyond a single case, concerning the
   similarity of triangles. In each task students are given three relations
   that exist either in every triangle or in special types. Their task is
   to verify, by creating an example, claims that argue for logically
   compounded claims built out of the given relations. 50 students, aged
   15-16, were asked to verify or disprove claims. Their submissions were
   automatically characterized along categories based on the correctness of
   the claims they chose and the examples they used to support the claims.
   We focus on characterizing the properties of the conjunction/disjunction
   design for automatically assessing conceptions related to examples
   generated by the learner with interactive diagrams. Our analysis shows
   that our automated scoring environment, which supports interactive
   example-eliciting-tasks, and the design principles of conjunction and
   disjunction of geometric relations, enable one to assess students'
   exploration of the logic of universal claims, characterize successful
   and partial answers, and differentiate between students according to
   their work.},

Abstract = {A crucial step in improving the use of digital technology (DT) for
   learning mathematical concepts in the classroom appears to be increasing
   teacher involvement in task development. Hence, this research considered
   the effect of a professional development (PD) programme designed to
   assist teachers with DT task production for implementation in their
   classrooms. Four groups of three Sri Lankan teachers were observed and
   guided as they designed and implemented DT tasks. We examine the
   effectiveness of the PD programme in terms of the richness of the tasks
   produced by the groups before and after the PD. The results suggest the
   intervention led to richer, more student-centred tasks. The reasons
   behind this improvement are analysed, along with factors that might have
   influenced the DT task development. The findings have implications for
   the design of secondary school PD programmes and may help educators to
   facilitate the training of mathematics teachers in the use of DT.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the PIAAC data, in this paper I examine how motivational
   factors such as motivation to learn and grit are related to low-numerate
   adults' employment status and their actual participation in lifelong
   learning in Germany, the United States and South Korea. In particular,
   the study uses PIAAC self-reported data on the degree to which the
   respondent ``likes learning new things{''}, and ``likes to get to the
   bottom of difficult things{''} as proxies of motivational factors in
   adult learning. Findings show that across three countries both
   motivation to learn and grit have independent relationships with adults'
   employment status and actual participation in adult learning.
   Considering that low-skilled adults are the ones who need further
   learning the most, yet are repeatedly reported to have the lowest rate
   of participation in further learning, these findings highlight the
   motivational factors in adult learning. They also suggest that
   motivation to learn and grit may mitigate the disadvantages that
   `vulnerable' adults experience due to low numeracy skills. Implications
   for mathematics educators and adult education research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Learning is a complex phenomenon. Analyzing its development can provide
   knowledge about regularities and differences in students' progress,
   which is needed to better understand learning. The aim of this study is
   to examine the development of students' Linear Algebra Schema through an
   introductory one semester course. For that purpose, Action Process
   Object Schema (APOS) theory's notions of Schema and Schema development
   were used to analyze students' constructions at three different times
   throughout the course. Results show how students' Schema are
   progressively constructed. They illustrate differences and commonalities
   in different students' Schema development. Some concepts and factors
   were found to play an important role in promoting Schema development.},

Abstract = {Issues of global and local importance such as climate change and
   homelessness require critical perspectives across multiple disciplines
   including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Our
   paper brings critical mathematics education and social justice alongside
   STEM education to explore experiences of learning to teach. We focus
   specifically on learning to teach through creating mathematics problems
   in/for STEM and social justice. As a collaborative research group we are
   from five countries with varied cultural backgrounds, teaching
   experiences, and academic pathways. Dialogue as method is used to
   examine experiences of creating problems through which students can
   interpret and transform the world. Data collected included 46 h of
   audio-recorded dialogue meetings, 26 developed problems, and 7
   interviews with 12 students. Results indicate creating mathematics
   problems in/for STEM involved navigating between mathematics, social
   justice, and STEM across all education levels and is supported with
   critical dialogue across cultural perspectives, diverse experiences, and
   expertise. Challenges lived include questioning the content of
   mathematics and STEM, deepening our own expertise to draw upon local and
   global problem contexts, and interrogating who benefits from such
   problems. Our study highlights the need for continued collaborative
   dialogue that not only gathers educators across disciplines but also
   includes students as co-creators of mathematics problems that could
   change their relationship with the world.},

Abstract = {The paper presents some reflections and activities developed by
   researchers and teachers involved in teacher education programs on
   cultural transposition. The construct of cultural transposition is
   presented as a condition for decentralizing the didactic practice of a
   specific cultural context through contact with other didactic practices
   of different cultural contexts. We discuss the background theoretical
   issues of this approach and also give an analysis of two examples of
   cultural transposition experiences carried out in Italy. In particular,
   by means of qualitative analysis of some excerpts, discussions, and
   interviews, we show that the contact with different perspectives coming
   from China and Russia fostered educational practices and reflections on
   whole number arithmetic education.},

   core part of elementary mathematics. Awareness of pattern and underlying
   problem structure promote the learning of whole number arithmetic. A
   growing consensus has emerged on the necessity to provide students with
   the opportunity to engage in algebraic reasoning earlier in their
   education. In fact, the U.S. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
   curriculum standards and the nationwide mathematics reform call for
   algebra readiness in elementary mathematical learning. The purpose of
   this study was to evaluate the effect of Conceptual Model-based Problem
   Solving (Xin, Conceptual model-based problem solving: Teach students
   with learning difficulties to solve math problems. The Netherlands:
   Sense Publishers, 2012) intervention program, with the Singapore bar
   model method (Kaur, The model methodA tool for representing and
   visualising relationships, In: Conference proceedings of ICMI study 23:
   Primary mathematics study on whole numbers, pp 448-455, 2015) serving as
   the bridge towards symbolic mathematical model equations, on enhancing
   additive word problem-solving performance of elementary students who are
   struggling in mathematics. Findings from this study indicate the promise
   of this program. Through representing a range of additive word problem
   situations in one cohesive mathematical model equation, students are
   prepared for generalized problem-solving skills.},

Abstract = {Statistical thinking partially depends upon an iterative process by
   which essential features of a problem setting are identified and mapped
   onto an abstract model or archetype, and then translated back into the
   context of the original problem setting (Wild and Pfannkuch, Int Stat
   Rev 67(3):223-248, 1999). Assessment in introductory statistics often
   relies on tasks that present students with data in context and expects
   them to choose and describe an appropriate model. This study explores
   post-secondary student responses to an alternative task that prompts
   students to clearly identify a sample, population, statistic, and
   parameter using a context of their own invention. The data include
   free-text narrative responses of a random sample of 500 students from a
   sample of more than 1600 introductory statistics students. Results
   suggest that students' responses often portrayed sample and population
   accurately. Portrayals of statistic and parameter were less reliable and
   were associated with descriptions of a wide variety of other concepts.
   Responses frequently attributed a variable of some kind to the
   statistic, or a study design detail to the parameter. Implications for
   instruction and research are discussed, including a call for emphasis on
   a modeling paradigm in introductory statistics.},

Abstract = {In this article we describe and evaluate processes utilized to develop
   an online learning module on mathematical modelling for pre-service
   teachers. The module development process involved a range of
   professionals working within the STEM disciplines including mathematics
   and science educators, mathematicians, scientists, in-service and
   pre-service secondary mathematics teachers. Development of the module
   was underpinned by Bybee's five E's enquiry-based approach and Goos et
   al.'s twenty-first century numeracy model. Module evaluation data is
   examined in relation to the quality of pre-service teachers' learning
   experiences and interview data from the study is analysed through the
   lens of `boundary crossing'. While the evaluation of the module was
   generally positive, aspects that required improvement were also
   identified including more meaningful inclusion of pre-service teachers
   and other stakeholders in the development process.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a concise survey of advances in the
   study of the psychology of creativity, with an emphasis on literature
   that is typically not cited in mathematics education. In spite of claims
   that mathematical creativity is an ill-defined area of inquiry in
   mathematics education, the literature from psychology can serve as an
   illustration for steady progress on numerous fronts including well
   defined terminology, established links between constructs (e.g.,
   creativity and intelligence; creativity and motivation), integrated
   perspectives that resolve dichotomies (e.g., process vs product), and
   theories that are verifiable through empirical research. Psychology can
   provide us with prospects to pursue well defined lines of inquiry, and
   absolve us from the pressure of re-inventing well known findings. Three
   postulates and corollaries are provided with caveats to provoke readers
   and to stimulate future progress.},

Abstract = {The design research programme learning by imitative and creative
   reasoning (LICR) studies whether, how and why tasks and teaching that
   enhance creative reasoning lead to a more productive struggle and more
   efficient learning than the common but inefficient task designs based on
   imitating given solution procedures. The purpose of this paper is to
   synthesise the research outcomes determined to date by providing the
   following: a conceptual framework for key concepts and relationships
   among teaching, tasks, student activities and learning; a theoretical
   basis for analyses of causal effects between task/teaching design and
   learning outcomes; a design research methodology for transforming
   initial design ideas, through cycles of evaluation and revision, into
   firmer design principles; and an application of this theory and
   methodology to empirical studies carried out to date, in order to
   propose task-design principles related to imitative and creative
   reasoning.},

Title = {How to make `more' better? Principles for effective use of multiple
   representations to enhance students' learning about fractions},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {To make complex mathematics concepts accessible to students, teachers
   often rely on visual representations. Because no single representation
   can depict all aspects of a mathematics concept, instruction typically
   uses multiple representations. Much research shows that multiple
   representations can have immense benefits for students' learning.
   However, some re-search also cautions that multiple representations may
   fail to enhance students' learning if they are not used in the
   ``right{''} way. For example, unless students can (1) properly interpret
   each individual representation and (2) make connections among multiple
   representations and the information they intend to convey, the use of
   multiple representations may actually confuse students rather than aid
   their learning. In this article, we review research-based principles for
   how to use multiple representations effectively so that they enhance
   student learning. Using fractions as an illustrative domain, we discuss
   how the choice of visual representation may affect student learning
   based on the conceptual aspects of the to-be-learned content emphasized
   by the representation. Next, we describe ways to help students interpret
   individual representations and to make connections among them. We
   illustrate these arguments with our own empirical research on fractions
   learning. We conclude by laying out open questions that future research
   should address.},

Title = {Differential instructional qualities despite equal tasks: Relevance of
   school contexts for subdomains of cognitive demands},
Journal = {ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 4},
Abstract = {Cognitive demand is a crucial dimension of instructional quality. Its
   heterogenous operationalizations call for refined investigations, with
   respect to discursive richness (generic conceptualizations) and
   conceptual richness (subject-related conceptualizations). Considering
   not only teachers' intended cognitive activation (operationalized, e.g.,
   by tasks), but also the enacted activation and individual students'
   participation as realized in the interaction, raises the question of how
   far the interaction quality is associated with students' prerequisites,
   school context, and class composition. In this paper, we present a video
   study of leader-led small-group instruction (in 49 groups of 3-6 middle
   school students each) with the same fraction tasks, so that differences
   in interaction quality can be scrutinized in generic and subject-related
   conceptualizations. In spite of equal task quality, large differences
   occurred in interaction quality across heterogenous class compositions.
   The regression analyses revealed that the enacted activation and
   individual participation were significantly associated with the school
   context (of higher-tracked and lower-tracked schools), but much less
   with individual learning prerequisites. These findings reveal the need
   to capture students' collective and individual engagement in cognitive
   demands in the interaction and in generic and subject-related
   conceptualizations and to systematically investigate their association
   with class composition.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the recent body of research in algebra and
   algebraic thinking from 2018 to 2022. We reviewed 74 journal articles
   and identified four clusters of content areas: (a) literal symbols and
   symbolizing, (b) equivalence and the equal sign, (c) equations and
   systems, and (d) functions and graphing. We present the research on each
   of these content clusters, and we discuss insights on effective teaching
   practices and the social processes supporting algebraic reasoning. The
   research base shows that incorporating algebraic thinking into the
   elementary grades, emphasizing analytic and structural thinking
   processes, and emphasizing covariational reasoning supports students'
   meaningful learning of core algebraic ideas. We close with a discussion
   of the major theoretical contributions emerging from the past five
   years, offering suggestions for future research.},

Abstract = {This special issue introduces recent research on mathematics in
   interdisciplinary STEM education. STEM education is widely promoted by
   governments around the world as a way of boosting students' interest and
   achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and
   preparing STEM-qualified workers for twenty-first century careers.
   However, the role of mathematics in STEM education often appears to be
   marginal, and we do not understand well enough how mathematics
   contributes to STEM-based problem-solving or how STEM education
   experiences enhance students' learning of mathematics. In this survey
   paper, we present a narrative review of empirical and conceptual
   research literature, published between 2017 and 2022. These literature
   sources are organised by a framework comprising five thematic clusters:
   (1) interdisciplinary curriculum models and approaches; (2) student
   outcomes and experiences; (3) teacher preparation and professional
   development; (4) classroom implementation and task design; and (5)
   policy, structures, and leadership. We use the framework to provide an
   overview of the papers in this issue and to propose directions for
   future research. These include: investigating methods and rationales for
   connecting the constituent STEM disciplines so as to preserve the
   disciplinary integrity of mathematics; clarifying what is meant by
   student ``success{''} in interdisciplinary STEM programs, projects, and
   other educational approaches; moving beyond classroom practices that
   position mathematics as just a tool for solving problems in other
   disciplines; understanding what makes a STEM task mathematically rich;
   and asking how STEM education research can productively shape STEM
   education policy.},

Abstract = {The nature of the area of mathematical competitions as a design science
   is considered, historical roots of mathematical problem-solving
   competitions are traced, the complementary aspects of mathematics as
   theory building and as problem solving are touched upon in relation to
   the practice of competitions. Two historical figures, Euler and Erdos,
   emerge, and the appropriateness of many of Euler's mathematical ventures
   are seen as role models for competition mathematics as first put into
   practice in mathematical competitions towards the end of the nineteenth
   century. Distinctions and definitions are made, a venture into
   identifying competition syllabi and the principal types of reasoning
   employed in solving competition problems is explored, and a description
   of the many different types of competitions is considered. Interaction
   between the field of mathematics itself and problem-solving competitions
   is briefly explored, as are the possibilities that open when
   competitions and their access to huge amounts of data, both national and
   international, are taken into account in research belonging to
   mathematics education. Finally, the range of topics addressed in this
   special issue of ZDM is covered, along with some possible conclusions
   relating to the components of the overview.},

Abstract = {According to situated expectancy-value models, motivational variables
   play an important role in students' engagement in academic mathematics
   courses and achievement. However, for academic mathematical learning,
   only a few studies provide information regarding the fluctuation of task
   values on different occasions (situation-specificity, state) and the
   extent to which task values depend on individual characteristics
   (personal-specificity, trait). Thus, answering these questions provides
   information about the extent to which adequate situational
   characteristics, such as relevance interventions, can influence
   students' motivation to engage in the learning process. To contribute to
   this discussion of the situation- and personal-specificity of task
   values, I surveyed 181 undergraduate students attending an advanced
   mathematics course. These students reported on their task values and
   effort three times in four different lessons during a course in linear
   algebra. I focused on the following three questions: (1)
   situation-specificity: to what extent do task values fluctuate between
   situations (and between persons)? (2) predictions of task values: to
   what extent do personal characteristics and situational perceptions
   predict task values? (3) predictions of effort: to what extent do
   personal characteristics and situational perceptions predict effort?
   These questions were answered by applying linear mixed models. The
   analysis results indicate that task values fluctuate only slightly in
   different situations and are strongly predicted by individual
   characteristics, such as interest in university mathematics, and task
   values predict effort. The theoretical and practical implications of the
   results are discussed.},

Abstract = {TRansforming Instruction in Undergraduate Mathematics via Primary
   Historical Sources (TRIUMPHS) is a multi-year, multi-institution
   collaborative project funded by the US National Science Foundation aimed
   at developing and testing student projects based on primary historical
   sources related to the original or subsequent development of core topics
   in today's tertiary mathematics curriculum. In addition to developing a
   broad range of projects and supporting their site testing by instructors
   across the US and Canada, TRIUMPHS includes a major
   Evaluation-with-Research component that is studying the effects of their
   classroom use on students and instructors. Our goal in this article is
   to share an overview of our research efforts related to the student
   learning experience-and as importantly, the tale of how we arrived at
   them-with others engaged in the effort to transform instruction in the
   field of undergraduate mathematics education. We provide a summary of
   three research initiatives undertaken by TRIUMPHS: a metadiscursive
   rules investigation based on Sfard's theory of commognition, an
   exploratory study of the concepts of transgressive actions and boundary
   crossings (first put forth by Polish psychologist Jozef Kozielecki)
   within the context of student learning of mathematics, and an
   examination of the different views students hold regarding the nature of
   mathematics. Additionally, we offer methodological reflections on how we
   revised our research questions and analytic tools based on theoretical
   constructs from mathematics education and beyond as the project unfolded
   over the first 6 years.},

Abstract = {The growing interest in classroom discourse reflects a wide recognition
   within the mathematics education community of the critical role of
   social interactions in the joint construction of mathematics knowledge.
   An extensive body of empirical and theoretical work has been undertaken
   in the last two decades to characterise the types of classroom talk that
   are conducive to learning. Yet, a key challenge remains for mathematics
   teachers to orchestrate whole-class discussions so that student
   responses to instructional tasks can be utilised to advance the
   disciplinary understanding of the entire class. This is especially the
   case when the mathematics task in focus is both open and cognitively
   challenging. Drawing upon a complementary accounts methodology, we
   analysed the Learner's Perspective Study (LPS) classroom and interview
   data from two classrooms in the United States and Japan to explore
   teacher orchestration of student responses to rich mathematics tasks.
   Significantly influenced by a body of literature on classroom
   microculture in mathematics education, this paper employed two
   complementary conceptual tools, coherence and meta-discursive rules, to
   develop an analytical framework for the purpose of exploring epistemic
   coherence of classroom discourse across diverse settings. The findings
   demonstrated that both teachers' orchestration of whole-class discussion
   supported the macro-structuring of students' experience at the level of
   topic coherence and contextual, organisational and conceptual
   connectedness, whilst the meta-narratives allowed the teacher to connect
   their goals for mathematics teaching and learning with the ongoing
   classroom activities and interactions.},

Abstract = {Russian culture developed under the burden of a series of totalitarian
   governments, a circumstance that, oddly, supported mathematics
   education. The Soviet period in particular saw a flowering of
   mathematical culture, the seeds of which have, since the collapse of the
   Soviet Union, been carried to the rest of Europe and America. A trickle
   of ideas, materials-and emigres-has swollen to a powerful stream. Some
   of the heaviest influences have occurred in the field of
   extra-curricular education. We explore some of the ways that Russian and
   Soviet mathematical culture has fertilized this field. In particular, we
   look closely at the pivotal role of the professional mathematical
   communities, both in Russia and in America.},

Abstract = {Decades of research have established that solving geometry proof
   problems is a challenging endeavor for many students. Consequently,
   researchers have called for investigations that explore which aspects of
   proving in geometry are difficult and why this is the case. Here,
   results from a set of 20 interviews with students who were taught proof
   in school geometry are reported. Students who earned A or B
   course-grades in the proof unit(s) were asked to share their thinking
   aloud while solving two proof tasks using smartpens. Student thinking
   was analyzed for two subgroups-students who were successful with both
   proofs (n = 7) and who were unsuccessful with both proofs (n = 13).
   Large differences were observed in how often students in the two groups
   exhibited certain competencies and behaviors. The largest gaps occurred
   in the ways in which students attended to the proof assumptions,
   attended to warrants in their proofs, and demonstrated logical
   reasoning.},

Abstract = {A basic mental model (BMM-in German `Grundvorstellung') of a
   mathematical concept is a content-related interpretation that gives
   meaning to this concept. This paper defines normative and individual
   BMMs and concretizes them using the integral as an example. Four BMMs
   are developed about the concept of definite integral, sometimes used in
   specific teaching approaches: the BMMs of area, reconstruction, average,
   and accumulation. Based on theoretical work, in this paper we ask how
   these BMMs could be identified empirically. A test instrument was
   developed, piloted, validated and applied with 428 students in
   first-year mathematics courses. The test results show that the four
   normative BMMs of the integral can be detected and separated
   empirically. Moreover, the results allow a comparison of the existing
   individual BMMs and the requested normative BMMs. Consequences for
   future developments are discussed.},

Title = {Simple pictorial mathematics problems for children: locating sources of

Abstract = {Pictorial representations are often used to help children understand the
   situation described in a given number-sentence scheme. These static
   pictorial problems essentially attempt to depict a dynamic situation
   (e.g., one bird flies away while there are three birds still sitting on
   the fence). Previous research suggested that such pictorial decrease
   problems impose higher cognitive load on children than the corresponding
   increase problems, even though both are solved with addition. However,
   the source of this cognitive load is unclear. It could be the direction
   of the depicted change or the position of the unknown (start vs. end
   set). To address this question and disentangle the sources of the load,
   we presented the problems in two different formats: (1) the conventional
   static one-picture problems and, (2) an adapted three-picture
   problem-format, which depicted the dynamic change in sequential steps.
   We also examined whether the three-picture problem-format makes the
   decrease problems easier. Seventy-nine first-graders participated in
   this study. Results showed that, overall, problems with the position of
   the unknown at the end were easier to solve than the ones in which the
   unknown was at the start. Furthermore, three-picture decrease problems
   with the unknown in the last position were easier than the one-picture
   decrease problems, and therefore appear to be a meaningful way to make
   such problems easier for children to understand.},

Abstract = {In this article we propose the use of Bayesian networks as a potentially
   promising way to model usable knowledge. Using the Classroom Video
   Analysis (CVA and CVA-M) assessments as a lab model for studying
   teachers' usable knowledge, we first explored whether we can identify
   the knowledge (pieces) underlying teachers' written responses. In the
   CVA approach we ask teachers to respond to short video clips of
   authentic classroom instruction based on different prompts that are
   designed to simulate common teaching tasks. We then explored the
   affordances of Bayesian networks to functionally model usable knowledge
   as an interconnected dynamic knowledge system consisting of different
   knowledge pieces and connected pathways weighted by situation-specific
   relevance and applicability. We explore the implications of these models
   for studying the development and growth of usable knowledge and propose
   the use of Bayesian networks as a novel and potentially promising way to
   model usable knowledge and for understanding how knowledge is used in
   teaching.},

Abstract = {For the past decade, philosophers of mathematical practice have examined
   the nature and function of proofs in mathematical practice, most often
   in mathematical research practice. More recently they have examined how
   mathematicians assess and get to know a proof not just by reading it,
   but through active engagement with the proof. For example,
   mathematicians traverse gaps in the proof by filling in details. This
   paper examines the relevance of this literature to the teaching of
   mathematics. In particular, it examines how reader engagement can be
   taught as an aspect of proofs in the context of upper-secondary
   mathematics education, and the argument is illustrated by teaching
   material on Hero's formula, which was developed for and tested in Danish
   upper-secondary mathematics teaching.},

   children with specific learning disabilities},

Abstract = {Even in primary school, mathematics achievement depends upon the
   efficiency of cognitive, metacognitive and self-regulatory processes.
   Thus, for pupils to carry out a computation, such as a written
   calculation, metacognitive mechanisms play a crucial role, since
   children must employ self-regulation to assess the precision of their
   own thinking and performance. This assessment, in turn, can be helpful
   in the regulation of their own learning. In this regard, a body of
   literature suggests that the application of psychoeducational
   interventions that promote the development of mathematics-related
   metacognitive (e.g., control) processes, based on the analysis of the
   students' errors, can successfully influence mathematics performance.
   The main objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of
   a metacognitive and cognitive training program developed to enhance
   various arithmetic skills (e.g., syntax, mental and written
   calculation), self-regulatory and control functions in primary and
   secondary school students exhibiting atypical mathematical development.
   Sixty-eight Italian children, 36 male and 32 female (mean age at
   pretest=9.3 years, SD=1.02years), meeting the criteria for the diagnosis
   of dyscalculia or specific difficulties in mathematics, took part in the
   study. Of these, 34 children (i.e., experimental group) underwent the
   cognitive and self-regulatory intervention enhancing mathematics skills
   training for 16 weekly sessions. The remaining students were assigned to
   the control group. For a pre-test and post-test, a battery of
   standardized mathematical tests assessing different mathematics skills,
   such as written and mental operations, digit transcription and number
   ordering skills, was administered and provided a series of measures of
   calculation time and accuracy (i.e., number of errors). In the
   post-test, the experimental group exhibited better accuracy in written
   calculation and in digit transcription. Overall, the current outcomes
   demonstrate that psychoeducational interventions enriching metacognitive
   and mathematical achievements through error analysis may be an effective
   way to promote both the development of self-regulatory and control
   skills and mathematical achievement in children with atypical
   mathematical development.},
