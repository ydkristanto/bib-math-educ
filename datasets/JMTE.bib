Title = {Studying a mathematics teacher's documentational and identity
   trajectories over time},

Abstract = {We study the interactions over 22 years between one mathematics teacher
   and his resources for teaching, especially digital ones, with a dual
   focus on the teacher's documentational and identity trajectories and
   professional development. We combined a theoretical framework on
   teachers' work with resources-documentational approach to didactics
   (DAD)-with a framework based on social practice theory-patterns of
   participation (PoP). The DAD analysis provided rich descriptions of
   which digital resources the teacher interacted with and of the
   transformative evolution of these interactions over time. The PoP
   analysis offered explanations of how and why the teacher transformed his
   interactions with the resources through foregrounding affective and
   contextual factors as significant for the teacher's formation of
   identity. We conclude that the combination of the two frameworks
   provided deeper and complementary insights into the teacher's long-term
   professional development with digital resources, and that such
   networking is needed to develop balanced understandings of teachers'
   long-term interactions with digital resources.},

Abstract = {This article reports on a second national survey of higher education
   institutions in the USA to answer the question ``Who teaches mathematics
   content courses for prospective elementary teachers, and what are these
   instructors' academic and teaching backgrounds?{''} and addresses
   valuable information not collected with the first survey conducted in
   2010. We surveyed 1740 institutions and a faculty member from each of
   413 institutions (23.7\%) participated in the survey. The survey results
   demonstrate that the majority of these institutions are not meeting the
   recommendations of the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences (2012)
   and the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (2017) for
   prospective elementary teachers to take at least 12 semester-hour
   credits of mathematics content designed specifically for them. The data
   do indicate that there is movement toward more activity-based approaches
   for these courses as compared to the 2010 survey. Additionally, there is
   an increase in these courses having instructors with doctorates in
   mathematics education as well as an increase in instructors having
   grades 7-12 teaching experience. Most instructors for these courses do
   not have elementary teaching experience and have likely not had
   opportunities to think deeply about the important ideas in elementary
   mathematics. While most institutions still do not provide training
   and/or support for these instructors, formalized support and training
   appear to be increasing since the 2010 survey.},

Abstract = {In a previous study, we validated the fractions schemes and operations
   trajectory (Norton and Wilkins 2012; Steffe in J Math Behav 20(3):
   267-307, 2002; Steffe and Olive Children's fractional knowledge.
   Springer, New York, 2010; Wilkins and Norton 2011) with PreK-8
   prospective teachers and explored PreK-8 prospective teachers'
   understanding of fractions based on fraction schemes and operations
   (Lovin et al. 2016). In that study, we found that most of the
   prospective teachers had constructed the lower-level fraction schemes
   and operations, but less than half had constructed the more
   sophisticated ones. In the current study, we explored ways of evoking
   the more sophisticated fraction schemes and operations, in particular,
   by implementing simple instructional changes to a mathematics course for
   PreK-8 prospective teachers. One change focused on fraction language,
   specifically encouraging the use of iterative fraction language (e.g.,
   3/5 is three equal-size pieces, each of which is 1/5 of the whole).
   Another change focused on intentional number choice, specifically
   emphasizing improper fractions. After focused fraction instruction that
   included these instructional changes, we found significant increases in
   PreK-8 prospective teachers' interiorization of coordinating three
   levels of units as well as in PreK-8 prospective teachers' construction
   of the reversible partitive fraction scheme and the iterative fraction
   scheme. We conclude with implications for practice and research in
   mathematics courses intended for PreK-8 prospective teachers.},

Abstract = {Video is often used in professional development courses to sensitize
   mathematics teachers to students' thinking and issues of classroom
   interaction. This article presents an approach that incorporates
   students' perspectives on mathematics classroom interactions into
   video-based professional development in order to enhance teachers'
   reflection on diverse awareness of students concerning demands within
   mathematics classroom interactions. This approach is theoretically
   justified by the empirical research on equal participation in classroom
   interaction and practically elaborated by video material from Grade 5
   students. Empirical snapshots from design experiments with teachers
   demonstrate that teachers' sensitivity can be enhanced.},

Title = {Evolution of teachers' and researchers' praxeologies for designing
   inquiry mathematics tasks: the role of teachers' beliefs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 22},
Abstract = {This paper is focused on the collaborative work of two communities, one
   of teachers and one of researchers, during a teacher professional
   development program on the inquiry-based learning approach in
   mathematics, addressed to lower secondary school in-service mathematics
   teachers. We conceptualize the design of inquiry mathematics task as the
   boundary object on which the two communities work collaboratively. We
   aim to study the evolution of teachers' and researchers' meta-didactical
   praxeologies for designing inquiry mathematics tasks, with the
   Meta-Didactical Transposition framework, to understand if and how their
   collaboration favors their convergence toward shared components of final
   meta-didactical praxeologies. In the results, we show that this
   convergence is reached thanks to internalization processes of
   praxeological components for designing inquiry mathematics tasks, as a
   consequence of the learning mechanisms activated by the common work on
   the boundary object. In this paper, we address also the issue of
   understanding the complex relationship between teachers' beliefs on
   inquiry mathematics tasks and the meta-didactical praxeologies of
   teachers and researchers. As a result, we propose a model in which the
   evolution of teachers' beliefs is taken into account both as an agent
   and a consequence of the evolution of the meta-didactical praxeologies
   of the two communities involved in the teacher professional development
   program.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the relationship between teachers'
   post-instruction noticing (PIN) and the quality of their mathematics
   instruction. We analyzed the conversations of elementary teachers around
   five coached lessons and scored their level of post-instruction noticing
   and the mathematical quality of the instruction of the lesson. We
   compared teachers' PIN levels with their instructional quality, using
   scores from the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) rubric, for
   each coached lesson. There was both alignment and discrepancies between
   the level of PIN and MQI scores. Explorations of the cognitive and
   psychological constructs that seemed to influence teacher's noticing
   showed that mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT), efficacy,
   beliefs, emotions, and identity was influential on teachers' PIN
   although they seemed to influence teachers differently. In some cases,
   the constructs appeared to support attentiveness to students' thinking
   and in other cases they did not. We discuss implications for
   professional development and future research on teachers' noticing.},

Abstract = {This paper explored the following: (1) teachers' ways of attending to
   students' written responses in pattern generalization tasks and (2)
   differences in the ways of attending to students' responses associated
   with different factors. A questionnaire was developed to classify
   teachers' ways of attending to students' written responses. The
   questionnaire was given to a sample of 91 practicing mathematics
   teachers from different grade levels (grades 4-12). The structure of
   attention referring to ``holding wholes, discerning details, recognizing
   relationships, perceiving properties, and reasoning on the basis of
   agreed properties{''} was used as a theoretical model. A mixed
   quantitative-qualitative approach was adopted to analyze the data.
   Analysis of data showed that teachers' attention to students' written
   responses seems to focus on distinguishing details of students'
   responses in particular step(s) of the pattern without demonstrating
   awareness of relationships that could hold in different steps of the
   pattern. The analysis also showed that differences in the ways of
   attending to students' written responses were associated with different
   factors. In particular, pattern generalization type (near and far
   generalization tasks), student strategy use (e.g., functional and
   recursive strategies), student reasoning approach (numerical and figural
   reasoning approaches), and teaching experience in particular school
   cycle were associated with significant differences in teachers' forms of
   attention to students' responses in pattern generalization. In contrast,
   the number of years of teaching was not associated with significant
   differences in teachers' forms of attention to students' responses.},

Abstract = {Professional support in the form of a year-long video club based on
   teacher noticing of student thinking was provided to three rural
   teachers who comprised the entire mathematics department of one
   secondary school (grades six through twelve). The focus of the study was
   to understand how participation in a video club structure for rural
   secondary teachers supports the development of noticing and to
   understand how the content of what rural teachers notice influences
   their pedagogical design capacity. Assuming a situative perspective,
   findings suggest video club participation influenced the teachers'
   curricular vision, their pedagogical design capacity, and their view of
   collaboration, as well as increasing their ability to notice and utilize
   student thinking for instructional decisions.},

Abstract = {This descriptive case study examines six mathematics teacher educators'
   (MTEs) perspectives on their design of content courses for elementary
   preservice teachers. By focusing on MTE's design goals and
   considerations for their mathematics content courses, the means by which
   they achieved these course design goals, and the challenges they
   encountered as they carried out their design goals, this study adds to
   the image of mathematics content courses, and sheds light on the work of
   MTEs. Our findings indicate that MTEs design content courses that take a
   learner-centered approach to instruction and that in designing
   learner-centered content courses, MTEs face a variety of challenges.
   Implications for the professional development of MTEs are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article uses a self-study research methodology to explore teaching
   an online course for mathematics specialists. The course included weekly
   videoconferencing sessions and focused on supporting their development
   as mathematics coaches working with K-8 teachers to enhance mathematics
   teaching and learning. The central question for the self-study was about
   the design of the course and the characteristics of the learning
   environment that resulted from the design. The study included journal
   reflections and survey data. Three themes emerged in the analysis of the
   instructional decision making for the course: student autonomy and
   engagement, authenticity and practicality, and fostering community.},

Title = {Mental processes underlying a mathematics teacher's learning from
   student thinking},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Teachers' knowledge of students' mathematical thinking is a growing area
   of research in mathematics education. The literature has reported
   plentiful evidence of the interplays between teachers' mathematical
   knowledge and their knowledge of students' mathematical thinking. The
   present study builds on this body of work to explain how such interplays
   occur. Over a semester, I worked in partnership with a secondary school
   mathematics teacher on cycles of task design, interactions with a
   student, and in-depth reflection on the student's thinking about linear
   programming. Adopting and extending Piagetian constructs of assimilation
   and accommodation, I describe several key mental processes that
   illuminate the teacher's learning of mathematics and of the student's
   mathematical thinking. I conclude with a discussion of the study's
   empirical and theoretical contributions to understanding teachers'
   mathematical learning in relation to student thinking.},

Abstract = {One characteristic of high-quality mathematics teaching is supporting
   students in engaging in tasks of high cognitive demand. In this paper,
   we explore relationships between two elementary teachers' efforts to
   integrate computational thinking (CT) practices-abstraction, debugging,
   and decomposition-into their mathematics instruction and their
   development of high-level tasks. Teachers engaged in professional
   development sessions about CT. Using their mathematics curriculum
   materials as a starting point, teachers then planned mathematics lessons
   to incorporate attention to at least one CT practice. Researchers
   transcribed their conversations and qualitatively coded the transcripts
   using an established framework for assessing the cognitive demand of
   tasks posed to students. Analyses of the planning conversations
   suggested that encouraging these teachers to examine their mathematics
   curriculum materials through the lens of CT practices supported them in
   adapting tasks from their curriculum materials in ways that raised the
   cognitive demand. Implications for the use of CT in elementary
   mathematics teacher education are discussed.},

Abstract = {Social media is an increasingly prevalent informal learning site for
   mathematics teachers. These platforms offer an emotionally and
   philosophically supportive space for teachers who seek to address
   oppressive teaching practices within their school communities. In this
   paper, we examine interactions in a Facebook group with over 14,000
   members to understand how a social media platform can be used by
   teachers to develop professionally. In our analysis of interactions
   within the Facebook group, we found teachers often use this space to
   seek support in combating the negative effects of tracking while also
   seeking support to better implement mixed ability learning
   opportunities. Through comments, community members encourage
   rehumanizing mathematics classrooms by promoting practices of creative
   insubordination (Gutierrez in Teach Excell EquityMath 7(1):52-60, 2016).},

Abstract = {This study is an examination of 79 elementary prospective teachers'
   (PSTs') capacity for recognizing the core ideas involved in modeling
   fraction addition problems and their difficulties in solving and
   presenting the process of fraction addition using area, length, and set
   models. PSTs completed a written task in which they represented the
   process of solving a set of fraction addition problems of varying
   complexity in terms of the sizes of the addends, the sums, and the
   denominators using the three models. The PSTs' responses to the task
   were analyzed and clustered to identify the most salient and recurring
   patterns of erroneous approaches to modeling. While the PSTs recognized
   the core ideas involved in modeling fraction addition problems, their
   actual work samples demonstrated several areas for improvement. Some
   PSTs had invalid answers and representations that were indicative of
   their misunderstanding of key concepts. Some PSTs had correct answers,
   but their model did not support sense-making. Additionally, some PSTs'
   representations did not clearly incorporate the salient properties of
   the area, length, and set models. Our analysis generated implications
   for mathematics teacher educators regarding what PSTs need to learn,
   develop further, unlearn, and refine in order to effectively teach uses
   of representation in elementary classroom.},

Abstract = {Mathematics coaching is complex work, and coaches must be supported to
   become experts in mathematics, mathematics instruction, and mathematics
   coaching. Using video and interview data from 12 mathematics coaches and
   one district administrator in one public school district in the
   southeastern USA, this qualitative study explores how the performative
   aspect of one group of mathematics coaches' doing the math routine
   opened up conversations about mathematics, mathematics instruction, and
   mathematics coaching. Findings indicate that as the coaches engaged in
   doing the math together, opportunities to discuss mathematics and
   mathematics instruction were opened up, while conversations about
   mathematics coaching rarely surfaced. In interviews, participants
   discussed the benefits and drawbacks of participating in doing the math.
   Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyse a grade 8 (age 13-14) Japanese problem-solving
   lesson involving angles associated with parallel lines, taught by a
   highly regarded, expert Japanese mathematics teacher. The focus of our
   observation was on how the teacher used carefully planned board work to
   support a rich and extensive plenary discussion (neriage) in which he
   shifted the focus from individual mathematical solutions to generalised
   properties. By comparing the teacher's detailed prior planning of the
   board work (bansho) with that which he produced during the lesson, we
   distinguish between aspects of the lesson that he considered essential
   and those he treated as contingent. Our analysis reveals how the careful
   planning of the board work enabled the teacher to be free to explore
   with the students the multiple alternative solution methods that they
   had produced, while at the same time having a clear overall purpose
   relating to how angle properties can be used to find additional solution
   methods. We outline how these findings from within the strong tradition
   of the Japanese problem-solving lesson might inform research and
   teaching practice outside of Japan, where a deep heritage of bansho and
   neriage is not present. In particular, we highlight three prominent
   features of this teacher's practice: the detailed lesson planning in
   which particular solutions were prioritised for discussion; the
   considerable amount of time given over to student generation and
   comparison of alternative solutions; and the ways in which the teacher's
   use of the board was seen to support the richness of the mathematical
   discussions.},

Abstract = {We examine the relationship between how teachers talk about teaching and
   their actual teaching practices. Analyses of their talk were based on
   extensive transcripts and writings and focused on metaphors and images
   invoked when discussing knowledge, learning, and teaching. Three
   distinct and coherent webs of association were identified, which we
   describe as ``traditional,{''} ``reform,{''} and ``middling.{''} For
   both traditional and reform teachers, preferred webs of association
   proved to be highly consistent with classroom practices. For teachers
   who tended to draw on the ``middling{''} web, practices tended to vary
   dramatically, and habits of speaking appeared to be linked to
   frustrations with teaching. Implications for professional learning are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {We believe that professional mathematicians who teach undergraduate
   mathematics courses to prospective teachers play an important role in
   the education of secondary school mathematics teachers. Thus, we
   explored the views of research mathematicians on the mathematics that
   should be taught to prospective mathematics teachers, on how the courses
   they teach can serve teachers in their work with school students, and on
   the changes they would implement if their courses were designed
   specifically for prospective teachers. We constructed profiles of the
   four mathematicians based on their responses to a clinical interview. We
   employed the construct of mathematics teacher-educators' triad in the
   reflective analysis of our findings and extended the construct based on
   the results of this study. In conclusion, we commented on potential ways
   to draw stronger connections between university mathematics and the
   mathematics taught in schools.},

Abstract = {In this article, I introduce a framework-the What, Who, and How of
   mathematics- that emerged from studying my teaching of prospective
   teachers and their views of the social and political dimensions of
   mathematics teaching and learning. The What, Who, How framework asks us
   to consider What messages we send about mathematics and the world, Whose
   perspectives are represented in mathematics, and How mathematical
   concepts and our world are related. I situate each aspect of the
   framework in the literature on social justice and critical mathematics
   and provide examples of prospective teachers' views. The What, Who, How
   serves as a tool to understand prospective teachers' views, to navigate
   a broad range of literature on social justice mathematics, and a means
   of informing the practice of teachers and teacher educators.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Despite interest in how students' implicit theories-their growth and
   fixed mindsets about their own learning-affect students as learners,
   relatively little research on mindset has looked at teachers as
   learners. This study explores elementary teachers' implicit theories
   about the malleability of mathematics intelligence and teaching ability.
   It also examines how implicit theories of learning relate to teacher
   noticing, a construct that has been linked to teachers' classroom
   practice and their students' learning outcomes. Findings from the
   present investigation indicate that teachers generally reported growth
   mindsets concerning mathematics intelligence and teaching ability. For
   both mathematics intelligence and teaching ability, teachers' reporting
   of more growth-compared to more fixed-mindsets was associated with more
   expert noticing, as measured by comments they wrote about elementary
   mathematics video clips on the dimensions of mathematics and student
   thinking. These findings point to intriguing possibilities about whether
   fostering growth mindsets (of mathematics intelligence and of teaching
   ability) in professional development settings might be leveraged to
   promote expert teacher noticing.},

Title = {Hidden mechanisms of differentiation: teachers' beliefs about student
   diversity},

Abstract = {This article provides an empirically grounded analysis for two
   fundamentally different models of mathematics teachers' beliefs about
   student diversity in Russian secondary schools: exclusive and inclusive
   models. Although teachers' beliefs are considered a central factor for
   the differentiated approach, teachers' beliefs could be stereotyped and,
   consequently, the evaluation of a student's ability would be
   systematically shifted and decisions about the possibility of teaching a
   student would be incorrect. Semi-structured interviews with 30
   mathematics teachers allowed us to investigate what criteria teachers
   claim to employ while classifying students in the classroom and what
   expectations they have for each group of students. It was found that
   within the exclusive model, teachers have an image of a ``normal{''}
   student and use discrete categories for labelling students with
   reference to the ``normality{''}. Within the inclusive model, teachers
   tend not to match students with discrete categories; rather they prefer
   to compare a student only with herself or himself. Research findings are
   discussed in the context of a possible ``fixed effect{''} on a student's
   development. However, there is a need for further investigation of a
   connection between teachers' belief systems, teaching practices and
   student achievement.},

Abstract = {What mathematical knowledge is required for teaching has been researched
   by many, with Ball et al. (J Teach Educ 59(5):389-407, 2008) and their
   practice-based theory of mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT)
   primary among them. However, what is required in terms of mathematical
   knowledge for teacher educator training has been researched much less.
   The present study builds on an emerging framework on mathematical
   knowledge for teaching teachers (MKTT) by Zopf (Mathematical knowledge
   for teaching teachers: the mathematical work of and knowledge entailed
   by teacher education, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 2010) augmented
   with more recent developments in the field. The empirical basis for the
   study stems from an implementation of a short course on history in
   mathematics education at the Danish School of Education, and in
   particular on two case studies involving three teacher educator students
   participating in that course. Based on analyses of their developments in
   terms of MKTT, we point to the potential of using history in both
   teacher and teacher educator training, and in particular historical
   source material. As part of the analyses, we also consider the teacher
   educator students' development of disciplinary knowledge of mathematics,
   especially in relation to developing and making use of knowledge of the
   epistemology of mathematics and mathematical work. We assert that the
   cases we present here address Zopf's call for case studies from
   different teacher education contexts as well as investigations of novice
   teacher educators, and further contribute to the developing theory of
   MKTT.},

Abstract = {In an effort to expand our knowledge base pertaining to pre-K-8
   prospective teachers' understanding of fractions, the present study was
   designed to extend the work on fractions schemes and operations to this
   population. One purpose of our study was to validate the fractions
   schemes and operations hierarchy with the pre-K-8 prospective teacher
   population to determine whether this population follows the same
   trajectory as upper elementary and middle school students. A second
   purpose of our study was to identify which of the fractions schemes and
   operations our sample of prospective teachers demonstrated evidence of
   having constructed along with what this tells us about prospective
   teachers' understanding of fractions. We were able to validate the
   hierarchy for this population, meaning that each lower-level fraction
   scheme/operation appeared to be a prerequisite to the higher-level
   schemes/operations. We found that although most of the prospective
   teachers had constructed the lower-level schemes and operations, less
   than half had constructed the more sophisticated ones. An unexpected
   result related to the association between the coordination of three
   levels of units and the iterative fraction scheme is addressed.
   Prospective teachers' reliance on procedural knowledge related to
   fractions also presented a challenge to assessing, in particular, their
   ability to coordinate three levels of units. We conclude with
   implications for research and practice in mathematics courses intended
   for pre-K-8 prospective teachers.},

Abstract = {The VIDEO-LM project (Viewing, Investigating and Discussing Environments
   of Learning Mathematics) is aimed at enhancing mathematics teachers'
   reflection on their professional practice, through watching and
   discussing videotaped lessons of unknown teachers. The discussions are
   guided by the use of an analytic framework, comprised of six detailed
   ``viewing lenses.{''} In this article, we first provide a brief
   historical context of practicing teacher education, followed by the
   description of the framework we developed. We then present selected data
   from 17 implementation sites that illustrate the impact of VIDEO-LM
   courses on the professional growth of participants. Findings show that
   using the six-lens framework in video-based peer conversations supports
   the development of a reflective language, with which mathematics
   teachers engage in deep discussions about core issues of their
   profession.},

Title = {Teachers' noticing of proportional reasoning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 27},
Abstract = {The importance of understanding what and how mathematics teachers notice
   is well documented, but more research is needed on content-specific
   noticing. In particular, knowing how teachers notice proportional
   reasoning, a vital topic spanning all grades of mathematics, could
   inform measures that support students' proportional reasoning. We
   examined how teachers noticed when responding to two prompts (one
   student-focused and one teacher-student-interaction-focused) after
   watching a video of a middle grades proportional reasoning lesson. We
   analyzed the proportional reasoning reported from 13 elementary and 20
   secondary prospective teachers and used cooccurrences along with
   noticing practices to describe how teachers noticed proportional
   reasoning and what aspects of proportional reasoning they noticed.
   Results indicate: (a) the two prompts resulted in differences in what
   and how participants noticed proportional reasoning, (b) participants
   were primarily descriptive and not interpretative when describing the
   proportional reasoning they noticed, and (c) the elementary and
   secondary prospective teachers both noticed similar aspects of
   proportional reasoning but showed differences in how the proportional
   reasoning cooccurred with the noticing practices. These findings
   reiterate the importance of the prompts used with teachers, the
   potential of using video to advance teachers' noticing of proportional
   reasoning, and the methodological potential of using cooccurrences to
   examine teachers' content-specific noticing.},

Title = {Contradictions in the learning of Euclidean constructions with GeoGebra
   by pre-service mathematics teachers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 26},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to answer the question: How does the handling of the
   contradictions that emerge in activities of initial mathematics teacher
   education contribute to the learning of geometric knowledge when
   pre-service teachers and the teacher educator solve geometric
   construction problems with GeoGebra? A dialectical-materialist approach
   is used to analyze an episode in which pre-service teachers and the
   teacher educator discuss the solution to the task of drawing a line
   perpendicular to a segment given a point off that segment. The episode
   was video-recorded and transcribed in its totality. Evidence in this
   research comes directly from the transcription of the episode, and
   analysis was carried out in two stages. As a result, we identify three
   formative actions that show the manner in which the conceptual and
   emotional contradictions emerge and are handled and we offer an
   explanation of how the handling of these contradictions contributed to
   the learning of pre-service teachers. We conclude that the way of
   handling the conceptual contradiction favored the awareness of the
   mobilized knowledge and that the handling of this contradiction was not
   exempt from emotional tensions, the latter of which we interpret as the
   manifestation of a contradiction of the autonomy/dependence type.},

   academically rigorous questioning sequences during instruction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The use of questioning to elicit student thinking is one of the
   cornerstones of ambitious teaching; thus, supporting prospective
   teachers in this complex practice is a core objective of mathematics
   teacher education. In this paper, we examine the academic rigor of the
   sustained questioning sequences prospective teachers use during
   instruction to elicit student thinking and the possible factor lesson
   planning plays in enacted sequences involving academically rigorous
   questions. We analyzed the questions they asked during lessons in an
   early field experience and traced how prospective teachers prepared for
   those questions as represented in their lesson plans. From our analysis,
   we found prospective teachers used three types of sustained questioning
   sequences when eliciting student thinking in the enactment of the
   lesson. Further, we found evidence suggesting a connection between the
   questions asked during enactment of a lesson and the quality of
   questions prospective teachers incorporated into their lesson plan.
   These findings inform how mathematics teacher educators can support
   prospective teachers during lesson planning to prepare to elicit student
   thinking in productive ways.},

Abstract = {How can teachers refine their strategies for purposefully engaging
   students in mathematical discussions when students are working in groups
   and the teacher enters an ongoing group conversation? In three
   educational design research cycles, four teachers collaborated with a
   researcher for one year to analyse, design and evaluate strategies for
   engaging students in small-group mathematical discussions. The idea of
   noticing (Mason in Researching your own practice: the discipline of
   noticing, RoutledgeFalmer, London, 2002; Sherin et al. in Mathematics
   teacher noticing: seeing through teachers' eyes, Taylor \& Francis, New
   York, 2011) was used to organize the findings-by paying attention to
   aspects in the mathematical discussions and interpreting the
   interactions, teachers could together refine their own actions/responses
   to better support students' work. The Inquiry Co-operation Model of Alro
   and Skovsmose (Dialogue and learning in mathematics education:
   intention, reflection, critique, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht,
   2004) was used as a theoretical base for understanding qualities in
   mathematical discussions. Ehrenfeld and Horn's (Educ Stud Math
   103(7):251-272, 2020) model of initiation-entry-focus-exit and
   participation was for interpreting and organizing the findings on
   teachers' actions. The results show that teachers became more aware of
   the importance of explicit instructions and their own role as
   facilitators of mathematical questions to students, by directing
   specific mathematical questions to all students within the groups. In
   this article, by going back and forth between what happened in the
   teachers' professional development group and in the classrooms, it was
   possible to simultaneously follow the teachers' development processes
   and what changed in students' mathematical discussions.},

Title = {Teachers' orientations toward using student mathematical thinking as a

Abstract = {Using student mathematical thinking during instruction is valued by the
   mathematics education community, yet practices surrounding such use
   remain difficult for teachers to enact well, particularly in the moment
   during whole-class instruction. Teachers' orientations-their beliefs,
   values, and preferences-influence their actions, so one important aspect
   of understanding teachers' use of student thinking as a resource is
   understanding their related orientations. To that end, the purpose of
   this study is to characterize teachers' orientations toward using
   student mathematical thinking as a resource during whole-class
   instruction. We analyzed a collection of 173 thinking-as-a-resource
   orientations inferred from scenario-based interviews conducted with 13
   teachers. The potential of each orientation to support the development
   of the practice of productively using student mathematical thinking was
   classified by considering each orientation's relationship to three
   frameworks related to recognizing and leveraging high-potential
   instances of student mathematical thinking. After discussing
   orientations with different levels of potential, we consider the cases
   of two teachers to illustrate how a particular collection of
   thinking-as-a-resource orientations could support or hinder a teacher's
   development of the practice of building on student thinking. The work
   contributes to the field's understanding of why particular orientations
   might have more or less potential to support teachers' development of
   particular teaching practices. It could also be used as a model for
   analyzing different collections of orientations and could support
   mathematics teacher educators by allowing them to better tailor their
   work to meet teachers' specific needs.},

Abstract = {The ability to reason inferentially is increasingly important in today's
   society. It is hypothesized here that engaging primary school students
   in informal statistical reasoning (ISI), defined as making
   generalizations without the use of formal statistical tests, will help
   them acquire the foundations for inferential and statistical thinking.
   Teachers who engage students in ISI need to have good content knowledge
   of ISI (ISI-CK). However, little is known about the ISI-CK of primary
   education pre-service teachers. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to
   describe this knowledge by surveying 722 first-year pre-service teachers
   from seven teacher colleges across the Netherlands. The survey consisted
   of five tasks using open-ended questions and true/false statements. The
   descriptive analysis showed that most respondents understood that
   descriptive statistics that take the global shape of the distribution
   into account can be used as arguments within ISI. Although a majority
   agreed that random sampling is a valid sampling method, distributed
   sampling was the preferred strategy for selecting a sample. Moreover,
   when asked to make a generalization beyond the data, most pre-service
   teachers only described the data and did not appear to understand that a
   representative sample can be used to make inferences about a population.
   These findings suggest that it may be useful if statistics education for
   pre-service teachers places more emphasis on sampling and inference,
   thereby prompting pre-service teachers to engage in ISI.},

Abstract = {This study examined the development of prospective teachers' (PTs)
   understanding of productive struggle using video episodes which PTs
   analyzed through the lens of professional teacher noticing. Our
   qualitative study included 66 PTs in four sections of a semester-long
   mathematics content course for prospective elementary and middle school
   teachers that focused on numbers and operations. The goal was to give
   PTs opportunities to observe students struggling with the course content
   the PTs were studying and to enact their specialized content knowledge
   and pedagogical knowledge for teaching simultaneously. Findings suggest
   that the PTs develop the ability to attend to and interpret the
   mathematics underlying the student struggles through video analyses.
   They also begin to identify teaching strategies and practices that
   appear potentially useful for supporting productive struggle. The use of
   a productive struggle framework helped the PTs develop a language for
   discussing productive struggle. Findings also suggest that PTs who had
   very little knowledge of productive struggle became more aware of what
   it looks like in practice, discuss ways to support students' struggle
   and suggest its potential value in supporting students' understanding of
   mathematics. One implication for this study is to carefully weave
   opportunities to develop teaching practices such as support of
   productive struggle into the content course for teaching. The PTs may
   better bridge the stance between being a student and becoming a teacher
   in what productive struggle looks like in learning mathematics.},

Abstract = {This study examines the association between mathematical knowledge for
   teaching and instructional quality in a sample of first-year elementary
   school teachers. Ten teachers completed the mathematical knowledge for
   teaching (MKT) survey at the end of teacher preparation. Three
   mathematics lessons taught during their first year of teaching were
   videotaped and scored using the Mathematical Quality of Instruction.
   Findings replicate prior studies that were conducted with more
   experienced teachers. A strong, positive and statistically significant
   association was found between teacher knowledge and the mathematics is
   clear and not distorted dimension of instructional quality. In addition,
   associations of moderate strength were found between MKT and other
   dimensions of instructional quality centered on the mathematics taught
   in the lesson. Analyses also revealed individual differences among
   teachers and raised the question of what other factors might impact
   instructional quality. Three cases studies highlight the role of lesson
   design, mathematics tasks, and participation structures that support or
   inhibit instructional quality and the use of knowledge during teaching.
   Conclusions suggest that preparation and induction programs should
   include a focus on individual teachers' mathematical knowledge for
   teaching, the development of a student-centered vision of mathematics
   instruction, and tailored support during the first year of teaching.},

Title = {Relationships between elementary mathematics specialist certification,
   knowledge, beliefs, and classroom learning environments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 13},
Abstract = {We report on the differences in mathematics learning environments in
   classes taught by certified Elementary Math Specialists (EMSs) (n = 28)
   and their peers (n = 33) as determined by observations of instruction.
   We used path analysis to examine how variables such as mathematical
   knowledge for teaching, beliefs, and background characteristics were
   related to the learning environment. We used the Classroom Learning
   Environment Measure (CLEM) observation protocol, which attends to
   aspects of mathematics lessons such as opportunities for students to
   justify their reasoning and attend to mathematical concepts. Our
   analysis revealed that learning environments incorporating such elements
   were significantly more prevalent in classes taught by EMSs, and that
   there were two paths indicating mediation effects on the relationship
   between EMS status and learning environment. One path was related to
   teachers' beliefs about the primacy of computation in learning
   mathematics; the other path was related to teachers' mathematical
   knowledge for teaching and their beliefs about the extent to which
   mathematical knowledge is constructed by the learner. We share
   implications for EMS programs and recommendations for future research on
   the impact of EMSs in elementary schools.},

Title = {Assessing student teachers' procedural fluency and strategic competence
   in operating and mathematizing with natural and rational numbers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Procedural fluency and strategic competence in operating and
   mathematizing with natural and rational numbers are based on a flexible
   and meaningful use of mental models, strategies, and procedures. The
   study to be presented in this paper pursued the question as to which
   subdomains or tasks relating to procedural fluency and strategic
   competence at upper primary school level are particularly challenging
   for elementary school student teachers. The newly devised assessment
   instrument included mathematical problems from a wide variety of content
   domains such as numbers and operations with natural and rational
   numbers, place value, computational strategies, estimation, (inverse)
   proportion, combinatorics, mathematization, and word problems. A
   preceding theoretical task analysis ensured that the solution of the
   problems required adaptation of strategies and flexible reasoning about
   a procedure or a formula. In the assessment, each of the 15 tasks were
   presented to 280 first-semester student teachers. As the results of the
   analyses indicate, combinatorial problems and division problems with
   rational numbers proved to be particularly challenging for a large
   proportion of the participants. Supplemental qualitative analyses of
   solution pathways confirmed that the assessment tasks allowed for
   multiple solution pathways. The item difficulties could be explained by
   a lack of ability to link mental models, strategies, and procedures. The
   study makes a connection between theoretical and empirical research on
   educational standards and teacher education. It contributes to the
   international state of research about student teachers' content
   knowledge by providing specific insights concerning procedural fluency
   and strategic competence.},

Abstract = {We explore the responses of 26 prospective elementary-school teachers to
   the claim ``1/6.5 is not a fraction{''} asserted by a hypothetical
   classroom student. The data comprise scripted dialogues that depict how
   the participants envisioned a classroom discussion of this claim to
   evolve, as well as an accompanying commentary where they described their
   personal understanding of the notion of a fraction. The analysis is
   presented from the perspective of productive ambiguity, where different
   types of ambiguity highlight the prospective teachers' mathematical
   interpretations and pedagogical choices. In particular, we focus on the
   ambiguity inherent in the aforementioned unconventional representation
   and how the teachers reconciled it by invoking various models and
   interpretations of a fraction. We conclude with a description of how the
   perspective of productive ambiguity can enrich teacher education and
   classroom discourse.},

Title = {On the alignment of teachers' mathematical content knowledge assessments

Abstract = {Instruments designed to measure teachers' knowledge for teaching
   mathematics have been widely used to evaluate the impact of professional
   development and to investigate the role of teachers' knowledge in
   teaching and student learning. These instruments assess a mixture of
   content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. However, little
   attention has been given to the content alignment between such
   instruments and curricular standards, particularly in regard to how
   content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge items are
   distributed across mathematical topics. This article provides content
   maps for two widely used teacher assessment instruments in the USA
   relative to the widely adopted Common Core State Standards. This common
   reference enables comparisons of content alignment both between the
   instruments and between parallel forms within each instrument. The
   findings indicate that only a small number of items on both instruments
   are designed to capture teachers' pedagogical content knowledge and that
   the majority of these items are focused on curricular topics in the
   later grades rather than in the early grades. Furthermore, some forms
   designed for use as pre- and post-assessment of professional development
   or teacher education are not parallel in terms of curricular topics, so
   estimates of teachers' knowledge growth based on these forms may not
   mean what users assume. The implications of these findings for teacher
   educators and researchers who use teacher knowledge instruments are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Since 2016, Park School in Denmark has consistently used Japanese lesson
   study as an approach to the professional development of its mathematics
   teachers. The school has moved beyond the initial adaptation of lesson
   study, and no longer includes external support. In this article, I
   investigate how three groups of teachers participated in the maturing
   lesson-study phases, especially the reflection phase. I apply social
   practice theory, particularly the concepts of figured worlds and
   improvisation, to examine the groups' improvisation of artefacts and
   actions during lesson study, and the mature, valued outcomes. This study
   explains how and why the mature lesson-study efforts at Park School
   offer predominantly superficial learning opportunities to students and
   teachers alike. It concludes that in countries unaccustomed to lesson
   study, external support (or other external knowledge sources) is also
   important at the mature stages of its adaptation. This study proposes
   three activities that offer such support.},

Abstract = {This research investigates how a lesson study (LS) on designing and
   implementing challenging tasks impacts Vietnamese high school
   mathematics teacher knowledge and beliefs. Its contribution highlights
   cultural considerations when adopting LS to the forefront to
   contextualize the impacts. The results show that the teachers developed
   their specialized content knowledge by attending to students'
   mathematics and creating cognitive conflicts building on student
   responses. The teachers changed their curriculum knowledge from
   implementer to transformer, improved knowledge about content and
   students attending to difficulties and misconceptions, and enhanced
   their knowledge about content and teaching in ways they designed,
   sequenced, and evaluated approaches that fit student learning. Finally,
   they changed their beliefs about mathematics to a comprehensive view of
   knowledge, mathematical proficiency, and sophisticated beliefs of
   teaching and learning. Discussion about the essence of LS when adopting
   it to different cultures is included.},

Abstract = {Given the scarcity of studies explicitly exploring the often tacit
   assumption that teachers' content knowledge (CK) is pre-requisite of
   pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), in this study, we draw on Shulman's
   conceptualization of these notions to examine their relation by
   content-aligning the CK and PCK measures. Toward this end, we analyzed
   data from a paper-and-pencil survey gauging primary schoolteachers' CK
   and PCK on fractions. The data of 373 completed teacher surveys were
   analyzed using two different complementary approaches, with the one
   compensating for the limitations of the other: item response theory
   analysis and statistical implicative analysis. Both analyses suggested
   that CK could be considered pre-requisite of PCK: when the CK and PCK
   items were placed on the same item response theory scale in most of the
   CK-PCK pairs, the PCK items were more difficult than their aligned CK
   items; additionally, in most of the quasi-implication paths of the
   statistical implicative analysis, answering the CK items was found to be
   pre-requisite of answering their aligned PCK items. We discuss the study
   findings, considering their theoretical, methodological, and practical
   implications.},

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of the Primarily Math Elementary
   Mathematics Specialist program on K-3 teachers' mathematical content
   knowledge for teaching, attitudes toward learning mathematics, and
   beliefs about mathematics teaching and learning. Three cohorts of
   teachers participating in the program were compared to a similar group
   of non-participating teachers. Teacher outcomes were measured
   longitudinally across 5 years. Participating teachers showed changes in
   their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs in line with program goals
   immediately after completion of coursework. Moreover, these changes were
   sustained in subsequent years, following program completion. Relative to
   the comparison group, participants demonstrated greater gains in
   knowledge as well as greater improvements in attitudes and beliefs.
   Implications of these results for professional development design,
   implementation, and evaluation are discussed.},

Title = {Introducing a symbolic interactionist approach on teaching mathematics:
   the case of revoicing as an interactional strategy in the teaching of
   probability},

Abstract = {This study examines an interactional view on teaching mathematics,
   whereby meaning is co-produced with the students through a process of
   negotiation. Further, teaching is viewed from a symbolic interactionism
   perspective, allowing the analysis to focus on the teacher's role in the
   negotiation of meaning. Using methods inspired by grounded theory,
   patterns of teachers' interaction are categorized. The results show how
   teachers' actions, interpretations and intentions form interactional
   strategies that guide the negotiation of meaning in the classroom. The
   theoretical case of revoicing as a teacher action, together with
   interpretations of mathematical objects from probability theory, is used
   to exemplify conclusions from the proposed perspective. Data are
   generated from a lesson sequence with two teachers working with known
   and unknown constant sample spaces with their classes. In the lessons
   presented in this article, the focus is on negotiations of the meaning
   of chance. The analysis revealed how the teachers indicate their
   interpretations of mathematical objects and intentions to the students
   to different degrees and, by doing so, create opportunities for the
   students to ascribe meaning to these objects. The discussion contrasts
   the findings with possible interpretations from other perspectives on
   teaching.},

Title = {The landscape of US elementary mathematics teacher education: course
   requirements for mathematics content and methods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 19},
Abstract = {The adequate preparation of future teachers of mathematics is critical,
   requiring sufficient opportunities to develop both pedagogical skill and
   content knowledge. Yet, despite new recommendations for mathematics
   teacher preparation, we know little about the landscape of course-based
   learning opportunities in US elementary teacher education programs. To
   what extent do US elementary teacher education programs meet the
   Standards for Preparing Teachers of Mathematics outlined by the
   Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (AMTE) for mathematics
   content and methods courses? Based on an a priori power analysis, we
   gathered a random sample of 291 higher education institutions. Within
   these institutions, we analyzed 736 programs, including Bachelor's,
   Master's, and Credential programs. We found that overwhelmingly US
   elementary teacher education programs do not meet the aspirations
   outlined in the AMTE standards, with Master's and Credential programs
   and those covering all elementary grades particularly falling short.
   Potential explanations for these challenges and implications for teacher
   education program design are discussed.},

Abstract = {Reviewing is a fitting term to introduce this book. I have been familiar
   with the work of Luis Radford for many years now, and this book is a
   welcome addition to an already impressive authorship. It gathers over
   ten, even twenty, years of development of the theory of objectification
   in various publication venues and revisits its concepts, while
   presenting them as a coherent whole. This is a book I will keep at hand
   and use for various reasons: it is full of ideas and examples,
   interesting references, and great wording. It is an excellent resource
   for those such as myself who work ``in dialogue `` with the theory, and
   for someone looking for a general yet precise and concrete understanding
   of the theory.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore teacher noticing differences of the sampled
   US and Chinese elementary teachers from cross-cultural mathematics
   videos. A total of 34 expert teachers commented on 25 video clips
   online. We coded what and how teachers noticed from the videos both
   quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings reveal teachers' strong
   interests and profound reflections, especially in the teaching domain
   including representations, communication, and teacher questioning/guide.
   Cross-cultural differences in teacher noticing were identified, which
   were discussed based on possible cultural influences. Implications in
   research and practice, teacher support, and methodology are discussed.},

Abstract = {In Australia, there is increasing scrutiny of teacher education
   processes in learning to teach primary mathematics. In this study, mixed
   methods, including linear regression, are used to examine the entry
   mathematical content knowledge of third-year Bachelor of Education
   Pre-service Students and to relate this to their graduating level of
   content and a measure of pedagogical content knowledge based upon
   capacity to describe student errors and provide learning support. The
   data indicate low levels of mathematical content knowledge at the
   beginning of the course, prompting questioning of the focus of earlier
   mathematics curriculum courses. Over the life of the study, there was
   improvement in some domains, which is to be expected where knowledge of
   mathematics was an intended outcome. Mathematical content knowledge at
   the start, but particularly at the end of the study, was highly
   predictive of expressions of mathematical pedagogical content knowledge.
   The stronger predictive value of mathematical content knowledge at the
   end of the study for mathematical pedagogical content knowledge suggests
   merit in developing the two aspects of teacher knowledge in tandem,
   rather than in different courses. The relevance of the data to teacher
   preparation in the institution and more broadly is discussed.},

Abstract = {Mathematical habits of prospective teachers affect problem comprehension
   and success and expose their beliefs about mathematics. Prospective
   elementary teachers (PSTs) (n = 121) engaged in a problem solving
   activity each week in class. Data were collected from PSTs enrolled in
   an undergraduate elementary mathematics methods course at a Southeastern
   State University over multiple semesters (six semesters, seven classes).
   PSTs' solution methods for one intentionally misleading mathematics
   problem were analyzed using a convergent parallel mixed methods content
   analysis. Two-thirds of PSTs misunderstood the problem scenario and
   directly translated numbers from the problem text. PSTs who answered
   correctly used a problem model strategy to comprehend the scenario and
   were more likely to use multiple models, draw a diagram, and draw a
   diagram before using another model. However, a large number of PSTs who
   answered incorrectly also used multiple models and drew diagrams.
   Self-correction was not common (8 of 121), because their equations did
   not provide feedback or support comprehension. Three kinds of
   imprecision also affected problem comprehension and were evident in both
   correct and incorrect solutions. Intentionally misleading problems
   helped PSTs see consequences of their mathematical habits and
   highlighted the importance of sense making and precision when creating
   problem models.},

Title = {Transformation of preservice mathematics teachers' teacher identity
   orientations through a video club},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 13},
Abstract = {Research in mathematics education has placed significant emphasis on
   teacher identity, particularly during teacher education, since it plays
   a critical role in shaping the identity of preservice teachers with
   regard to teaching mathematics. However, as teacher identity is context
   dependent, it is essential to study preservice teachers' identities in
   various contexts to develop expertise in mathematics teacher education.
   This study explored the transformation of preservice mathematics
   teachers' (PMTs) teacher identity orientations after participating in a
   video club. Concentrating on task perceptions as the indicator of
   teacher identity, the change in the teacher roles that PMTs would like
   to adopt in the future and the student outcomes they associated with
   these roles were investigated. The analysis of teacher identity
   orientations before and after participating in the video club revealed
   that PMTs' teacher identity orientations were transformed by their
   participation because the video club increased their self-awareness and
   understanding of the complexity of teaching mathematics. The most
   noticeable transformation was observed in the didactical roles and their
   associated outcomes. These roles were transformed from being a
   didactical expert aiming to develop students' affective outcomes to
   being a didactical expert who prioritizes students' cognitions. Although
   PMTs' expertise in teaching mathematics and the content of the video
   cases limited their orientations, the video club can simulate
   alternative experiences for teacher education programs aiming to support
   PMTs' teacher identity orientations.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the discourse of teachers and instructors in a
   TEAMS (Teaching Exploratively for All Mathematics Students) professional
   development (PD) setting and on the discursive mechanisms that afford
   such learning. We conceptualize learning in this PD as a change in a
   teacher's pedagogical discourse-from alignment with Delivery Pedagogical
   Discourse (DPD) to alignment with Explorative Pedagogical Discourse
   (EPD). This change in pedagogical discourse involves commognitive
   conflicts between the DPD and EPD. Data for the study include 8
   videotaped sessions from a 2-year TEAMS PD for middle school mathematics
   teachers. Results show that conflict revolved around four themes. The
   most common was about students' abilities and its relation to
   instruction. The others were: Who is responsible for constructing
   mathematics knowledge in class? Limited view of the EPD, and what is
   considered ordinary instruction? We also identified four levels of
   conflict, ranging from commognitive conflict that is implicit to the
   participants, to conflict that is made explicit and reflected upon.
   Finally, results show movement from implicit conflict towards
   explication of conflict during the two years of the PD.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a study conducted within VIDEO-LM (Viewing,
   Investigating and Discussing Environments of Learning Mathematics), a
   video-based professional development project for secondary mathematics
   teachers that aims to enhance reflection on practice. The study explored
   VIDEO-LM sessions where Israeli teachers watched an 8th grade geometry
   lesson from Japan. We analyzed teachers' discussions around this lesson
   and characterized main themes and reflection types. Findings suggest
   that watching the Japanese lesson, using the VIDEO-LM framework, led to
   productive discussions among teachers. The fact that the videotaped
   lesson was culturally ``far{''} from the teachers' reality provoked them
   to re-see everyday aspects of their practice, revealing some dissonances
   which promoted reflective thoughts and actions.},

Abstract = {The discipline of mathematics values precision and teachers are
   accountable for promoting and supporting their students in attending to
   precision (ATP), which in the USA is an explicit standard for
   mathematical practice included in the Common Core State Standards for
   Mathematics. This study used thematic discourse analysis to examine how
   eight middle and high school teachers understand and interpret the
   mathematical practice of ATP through discussion within a teacher
   learning community. Findings suggest that teachers' talk prioritized the
   themes of precision with numerical quantities, precision with
   vocabulary, and precision with symbols. In many cases, these themes were
   discussed through examples from the teachers' experiences with students
   and the focus was on being precise (or not) rather than attending to
   issues of precision. Their discourse also highlighted the teachers'
   influential role in engaging their students in ATP and the relationship
   between ATP and student learning, with some teachers articulating a
   direct relationship of teachers explaining ATP to students and other
   teachers articulating a complex relationship of experiences via ATP.
   Overall, teachers' perspectives on ATP provide insight into how they
   create opportunities for students to engage in ATP in their classrooms
   and may inform the development of shared meaning about ATP across the
   field.},

Abstract = {A key requirement of successful initial teacher education is the
   development of professional vision, which includes shifting attention to
   features of the situation relevant to the specialized goals of teaching.
   Existing research hints at the value of targeted video-based courses in
   the development of professional vision, but often raises questions about
   the sources of shifts in the pattern of attention. We argue that
   existing work makes it difficult to distinguish whether shifts seen
   across video interventions are the results of the intervention, teaching
   experience, or methodological issues with the unbalanced use of videos
   in the data collection in these studies. Our first study suggests
   pre-service teachers' teaching practice experience does not notably
   affect attention, but that choice of video does. Our second study
   addresses the methodological issues and suggests that we may discount
   different or unbalanced videos as a source of the shifts in the pattern
   of attention. Finally, by introducing a new synthesis of the results in
   the literature, we identify a previously hidden key distinction between
   studies and suggest reasons why different studies have shown different
   results in this area.},

Title = {Emergent mathematical worlds from teacher knowing in whole-class
   discourse: using an enactivist lens on the teaching of exponential
   functions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 16},
Abstract = {This paper reports findings related to the pursuit of describing a lived
   knowing for teaching mathematics. Specifically, we used an enactivist
   perspective to describe the knowing exhibited by three experienced high
   school teachers in their instructional actions while leading whole-class
   instruction on the topic of the equations of exponential functions. From
   classroom observations, we constructed maps of the emergent mathematical
   worlds of ideas and collective mathematical activity. Three major
   categories of ideas emerged in all three teachers' classrooms relating
   to the recursive multiplicative nature of exponential functions, the
   role of the independent variable, and the definition of exponential.
   Findings of this study suggest attending to teacher knowing for
   mathematical whole-class instruction must include describing the role of
   the mathematical activity in the emergence of the ascribed mathematical
   ideas. When teachers facilitated the collective mathematical activity as
   the means by which the mathematical ideas and justifications emerge, the
   mathematical worlds were diverse and complex, and connections among
   ideas were more robust in their comprehensibility.},

Title = {Primary teachers' preferred fraction models and manipulatives for

Abstract = {When teaching fractions, teachers make instructional decisions about if,
   when, and how to use the many different types of fraction models and
   manipulatives. In this study, we sought insights into their pedagogical
   reasoning with fraction representations via their preferences, both for
   solving tasks themselves and for teaching (in general and for specific
   fraction concepts and operations). Nearly 200 practising Australian
   primary teachers participated in an online survey and we drew on a
   Fraction Schemes theorisation to analyse quantitative and qualitative
   data. A majority of teachers indicated a personal preference for the set
   model for four out of five schemes; for one scheme most teachers
   preferred the circle model. Their reasons suggested that the nature of
   each task in a scheme and the specific fractions involved, played a role
   in influencing their preferences. With respect to teaching fractions,
   the teachers also indicated a high level of preference for teaching with
   the set model in general, and secondly for the rectangle model. Their
   preferences, except for number lines, were not found to be associated
   with the teachers' nominated year level. We found that a high personal
   preference for a set model was associated with a preference for teaching
   with the same model in general, but not for teaching with the matching
   manipulative (counters or chips). The teachers indicated a high level of
   preference for teaching with the fraction bars manipulative for several
   fraction concepts, but this was not associated with a personal
   preference for linear models. Implications for further research are
   discussed.},

Title = {Prospective teachers' analysis of a mathematics lesson: examining their

Abstract = {This study examined elementary and secondary prospective teachers'
   (PTs') abilities to analyze a classroom lesson in order to make claims
   about student thinking around specific mathematical learning goals based
   on relevant and revealing evidence. Previous research suggests PTs have
   some skills in analyzing evidence but apply them inconsistently. Our
   goal was to describe in more detail the strengths and weaknesses in PTs'
   ability to analyze evidence of student thinking. Results indicate that
   PTs can make some appropriate claims about student learning in a lesson
   transcript, but more often make overly broad and general claims. PTs
   were able to support their claims with specific student work but often
   used poorly aligned evidence. PTs also often explicitly recognized the
   shortcomings of evidence from the lesson transcript, but then relied on
   that evidence to make claims about student thinking. Finally, PTs'
   background, such as number of teacher education courses completed, does
   not appear to strongly influence their ability to make claims and
   support them with evidence, though secondary PTs were more likely to
   recognize the limitations of evidence than elementary PTs. These results
   have implications for teacher educators, pointing to the importance of
   designing interventions to help PTs look beyond the most visible and
   salient features of a lesson when analyzing student thinking.},

Abstract = {Among the critical components related to the improvement of mathematics
   learning are the design of high cognitive demand tasks and teachers'
   ability to maintain these cognitive demands during their implementation
   of lessons. We investigate the factors affecting the maintenance and
   decline of cognitive demand in the implementation of a statistics lesson
   by two teachers who participated in a Lesson Study group for third
   graders (8-9 years old). The results of the investigation show notable
   changes in the maintenance factors associated with the teachers'
   questions and feedback, the scaffolding provided for the students'
   reasoning and the modelling of high-level performance. In terms of the
   decline in the level of cognitive demand, the greatest changes were
   found in factors corresponding to the routinization of problematic
   aspects of the task and to problems in lesson management. Based on the
   results of our collaborative work with teachers in the context of Lesson
   Study, we conclude that it is possible to design and implement
   statistical tasks in primary school classrooms that maintain high
   cognitive demand.},

Abstract = {The notion of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) was posited in the
   context of school teaching and the knowledge used by teachers teaching
   school students. It has been examined for a number of discipline areas,
   notably mathematics. There are, however, other teaching contexts,
   including those of teacher educators, whose students are pre-service
   teachers (PSTs). The content these teacher educators teach is not
   subject discipline knowledge (or not solely), but the PCK for teaching a
   subject discipline. What knowledge do teacher educators use as they
   teach PCK? This paper presents a framework for the PCK required of
   mathematics teacher educators as they work to develop PSTs' PCK for
   teaching mathematics. The framework builds on existing research into PCK
   and categorises aspects of the work of teacher education. The
   framework's usefulness is examined by studying the PCK used by the first
   author in building PSTs' understanding of mathematics teacher PCK.},

Abstract = {Researchers have long debated the meaning of mathematical understanding
   and ways to achieve mathematical understanding. This study investigated
   experienced Chinese mathematics teachers' views about mathematical
   understanding. It was found that these mathematics teachers embrace the
   view that understanding is a web of connections, which is a result of
   continuous connection making. However, in contrast to the popular view
   which separates understanding into conceptual and procedural, Chinese
   teachers prefer to view understanding in terms of concepts and
   procedures. They place more stress on the process of concept
   development, which is viewed as a source of students' failures in
   transfer. To achieve mathematical understanding, the Chinese teachers
   emphasize strategies such as reinventing a concept, verbalizing a
   concept, and using examples and comparisons for analogical reasoning.
   These findings draw on the perspective of classroom practitioners to
   inform the long-debated issue of the meaning of mathematical
   understanding and ways to achieve mathematical understanding.},

Title = {Increase in self-efficacy in prospective teachers through theory-based
   lesson study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 5},
Abstract = {This paper explores the education of prospective teachers with regard to
   the Theory of Didactical Situations when they engage in lesson study. We
   particularly focus on studying how a lesson study process oriented
   towards the Theory of Didactical Situations contributes to increasing
   prospective teachers' self-efficacy to plan and teach lessons based on
   such theory, reducing the gap between theory and practice. Prior to the
   study, we will discuss how the theoretical postulates assumed in lesson
   study affect crucial aspects of the process. The study is implemented
   with 47 prospective early childhood education teachers. We also consider
   another group of 47 prospective teachers that were engaged in practicum
   at the time the lesson study process took place. Using a
   quasi-experimental methodology based on a questionnaire developed ad hoc
   that captures the particularities of the didactic paradigm assumed, the
   results of our study show that both lesson study and practicum lead to a
   statistically significant increase in future teachers' self-efficacy to
   plan and teach lessons in line with the paradigm assumed. However, size
   effect measures show that the increase observed in the lesson study
   group is significantly higher, which supports the benefits of lesson
   study in initial teacher education. We discuss what the features of
   lesson study are that could be related to this increase. Finally, we
   sketch new lines of research connected with the benefits of lesson study
   versus other teacher education experiences like practicum, as well as
   with links between self-efficacy and knowledge growth in lesson study.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the middle school preservice mathematics
   teachers' conceptualization of what it means for a problem to be
   mathematically rich and contextually realistic and how their conceptions
   evolved during a series of professional development activities. Fifteen
   middle school preservice mathematics teachers were involved in this
   design-based research. The professional development activities were
   designed based on L. Shulman and J. Shulman's (Shulman and Shulman,
   Journal of Curriculum Studies 36:257-271, 2004) reflective and communal
   clusters with psychological roots in Schon's notion of ``reflective
   practitioners{''} and Vygotsky's social development theory. These
   professional development activities were integrated into the methods and
   field experience courses of the teacher education program. The audio
   records of the whole group and small group discussions and all written
   products (i.e., problems, criteria list, and reflection memos) were
   analyzed to understand preservice teachers' conceptions. This study
   revealed that the professional development activities helped preservice
   teachers produce the problems that would be interesting and encouraging
   for students to develop their own solution methods. Preservice teachers'
   conceptions also evolved in a collective and reflective community. In
   this respect, this study presented a way to design professional
   development for teachers that nurtures their understanding of the
   components supporting mathematical richness and contextual
   meaningfulness of a problem. Hence, this study provided implications for
   teacher education practices and future research on mathematics teacher
   preparation.},

Abstract = {Classroom observations have become an integral part of research related
   to mathematics education. In this qualitative study, we describe the
   current state of the mathematics education field with regard to the use
   of classroom observation. The research question was: How is classroom
   observation being used to measure instructional quality in mathematics
   education research? In all, 114 peer-reviewed manuscripts published
   between 2000 and 2015 that involved classroom observation as part of an
   empirical study were examined using a cross-comparative methodology.
   Seventy (61\%) did not use a formalized classroom observation protocol
   (COP), 21 (18\%) developed their own COP, and 23 (20\%) used a
   previously developed COP. Of the implemented COPs, 44\% have published
   validity evidence in a peer-reviewed journal. We perceive the great
   variety of research approaches for classroom observation as necessary
   and potentially challenging in moving mathematics education forward with
   respect to research on instructional contexts.},

Abstract = {In this study, we sought to identify how feedback about classroom
   observations affected novice university mathematics instructors' (UMIs)
   teaching practices. Specifically, we examined how a Red-Yellow-Green
   feedback system (RYG feedback) affected graduate student instructor
   (GSI) scores on an observation protocol (GSIOP). The protocol was
   developed specifically for this population, and both the GSIOP and RYG
   feedback were used within a peer mentoring program for GSIs, wherein
   novice GSIs were mentored by more experienced GSIs. Mentors observed
   novices' classrooms using the GSIOP and provided RYG feedback as part of
   observation-feedback cycles. We analyzed 100 sets of scores, each
   collected over the course of a semester containing on average three
   observation-feedback cycles. Analyzing the semester-long datasets
   longitudinally provided insight into what types of feedback informed and
   influenced observed teaching. After qualitatively coding the feedback
   provided to the GSIs by their mentors along multiple dimensions, we
   found certain forms of feedback were more influential for observable
   changes in GSIs' teaching. For example, pedagogical feedback that
   included contextualization (context and focal events) demonstrated a
   more positive change in GSIOP score than feedback that lacked
   contextualization. Our results suggest that contextual formative
   feedback has a positive change to student-focused and teacher-focused
   observations.},

Abstract = {Research in teacher education is still a field dealing with open
   questions. One of these open fields is the incorporation of new
   pedagogical principles such as inquiry-based processes. In this
   transition encouraged by most national curricula, knowledge involved in
   study processes changes heavily: it moves from well-established and
   static knowledge to more dynamic and provisional structures. This
   transition causes the description, management and analysis of knowledge
   to be a challenge for teachers. Researchers within the Anthropological
   Theory of the Didactic have used question-answer maps to describe
   knowledge involved in the implementation of inquiry teaching formats. We
   propose to use these question-answer maps as a research tool to be
   incorporated in teacher education to empower teachers to deal with this
   new nature of knowledge to be taught. We present in this paper an
   exploratory case study of an online course for secondary teachers using
   question-answer maps as a tool to describe knowledge.},

Abstract = {This paper raises the possibility of enhancing prospective and
   practicing teachers' awareness of example use in classrooms by using
   theories to analyze an authentic case. The study was carried out in the
   context of a university course where participants analyzed an excerpt
   from a tenth-grade geometry class. A qualitative analysis of
   participants' comments related to example use in the case revealed that
   different participants related to different theories when discussing the
   same example. The most frequent aspect of example use noted was the
   psychological aspect, such as the use of intuitive and non-intuitive
   examples. In general, teachers felt that the case activity contributed
   to their understanding of example use in the classroom, although not
   necessarily to a great extent. One implication of the study is that
   analyzing an authentic case while focusing on certain theories, such as
   example use, may serve as a rehearsal for the teacher who wishes to
   reflect on and analyze example use in her or his classroom. Thus, theory
   is brought into the practice of teaching.},

Abstract = {Curriculum materials are integral to the mathematics classroom, yet
   little is known about how teachers read curriculum in order to envision
   enactment. Through an assignment involving an approximation of actual
   teaching practice, we investigated prospective teachers' documentational
   genesis (Pepin et al. in ZDM 45:929-943, 2013) from curriculum materials
   to their visions of enactment based on those materials. In mathematics
   methods courses, we assigned prospective teachers (N=33) to one of two
   widely adopted curricula to generate a lesson plan and corresponding
   animation. We analyzed data from the assignment, termed lesson
   planimation, to reveal how prospective teachers use curriculum for the
   purposes of enactment. Prospective teachers drew upon curricular
   elements to different extents, with goals ranging from concern for
   learning mathematical ideas to student enjoyment of math class.
   Implications for theory, curriculum, and instruction are discussed.},

Abstract = {The preparation of teachers to teach mathematics to primary school
   children differs across nations and cultures. This study used mixed
   methods to examine the basic content knowledge of trainee teachers in
   Australia and China. A simple test (30 questions) of content based on an
   international comparative study in mathematics teacher training found
   that many of the Australian trainee teachers struggled with material
   that they might be expected to teach, while the Chinese teachers largely
   demonstrated mastery. The significance of this finding is examined in
   the context of the teacher preparation programs in two teacher training
   institutions. Cultural commentary is added by leading academics in each
   institution. It was found that in the Australian teacher training
   institution there was a focus on generic skills and relatively limited
   opportunity to develop trainee teachers' content knowledge or specific
   pedagogy. The relevance of the findings is discussed through the
   framework of different beliefs in the nature of mathematics and
   mathematics teaching that have been reported to dominate the different
   educational systems in China and Australia.},

Abstract = {Lesson Study, which assumes multiple variations, is a collaborative
   method that provides an opportunity for teachers to notice
   professionally. We analyzed how audible conversational components
   afforded and constrained the verbalization of professional noticing of a
   lesson study team. The team, comprised of six prospective teachers, a
   classroom teacher, and a university facilitator, participated in weekly
   lesson study cycles in a teacher education program. Results indicate
   that a structured lesson study process afforded professional noticing as
   participants attended to and analyzed students' thinking. However,
   noticing was constrained by shifts in the conversation content and
   lengthy segments of individuals exerting expertise. Findings indicate
   that the facilitator played a crucial role in increasing the incidence
   of professional noticing and also contributed to the decline of
   noticing. Implications for teacher education programs are included.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying the
   knowledge that mathematics teachers require in order for their teaching
   to be effective. However, only a few studies have focused on the design
   and application of instruments that are capable of exploring different
   aspects of teachers' didactic-mathematical knowledge about specific
   topics. This article reports the results obtained following the
   application of a questionnaire designed specifically to assess certain
   key features of prospective, higher secondary-education teachers'
   knowledge of the derivative. The questionnaire was constructed using a
   theoretical model of mathematical knowledge for teaching based on the
   onto-semiotic approach to mathematical knowledge.},

Abstract = {Numerous video-based programs have been developed to support mathematics
   teachers in reflecting on and examining classrooms interactions without
   the immediate demands of instruction. An important premise of such work
   is that teacher learning occurs at the time that the video is viewed and
   discussed with teachers. Recent advances in technology, however, offer
   new approaches for the use of video with teachers. We claim that these
   new technologies provide important opportunities for teacher learning
   prior to the viewing and discussion of video with colleagues. In
   particular, we believe that important teacher learning can occur from
   the activities of (1) capturing video from one's own classroom and (2)
   selecting clips to share with others. The goal of this article is to
   introduce key strategies that three groups of middle and high school
   mathematics teachers use prior to, during, and after instruction as they
   engage in this work. We believe that increased attention to these
   strategies is necessary in order to better understand how to support
   teacher learning in the context of new digital technologies.},

Title = {Development of teachers' attitudes and self-efficacy expectations for
   inclusive mathematics instruction: effects of online and blended
   learning programs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 27},
Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a quantitative study investigating
   the development of teachers' attitudes and self-efficacy expectations
   for inclusive mathematics instruction in the context of an in-service
   training that was designed in a blended learning format and compared to
   an unsupported online offer. In the blended learning format, 101
   teachers participated in an in-service training, designed as a
   combination of six workshops with concrete activities based on materials
   for inclusive mathematics teaching and intermittent practical phases
   with collaborative learning environments for children aged 6-12 years.
   The teachers' attitudes toward inclusive mathematics instruction and
   self-efficacy expectations are collected by using published scales
   (KIESEL) and scales under development. The effects of the blended
   learning program are analyzed by the t test for dependent samples or the
   nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and compared to the effects of
   an online offer without further guidance and support. On the one hand,
   the results indicate the importance of the blended learning program in
   comparison with the unsupported online offer. On the other hand, they
   show insights into the relevance of the participants' interaction with
   the materials during the concrete activities as well as of their try
   outs in and their reflection on teaching practice during the
   intermittent practical phases.},

Title = {How often and when teachers should teach with challenging tasks: the
   role of motivational beliefs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 14},
Abstract = {Prior research has revealed a variety of factors associated with teacher
   views around when to incorporate challenging mathematical tasks into
   instruction, such as teachers' pedagogical content knowledge and their
   prior assumptions about student ability. There has been less focus on
   how motivational beliefs (teacher anxiety, enjoyment, confidence) shape
   teachers' views around teaching with challenging tasks. To address this
   gap, the current study administered questionnaires to Australian primary
   school teachers (n = 92) prior to them undertaking a professional
   learning programme focusing on teaching mathematics through sequences of
   challenging tasks. Employing logistic regression, we found that more
   teaching experience and lower levels of teacher anxiety teaching
   mathematics were associated with the view that challenging tasks should
   be introduced earlier in a student's schooling. We also found that
   higher levels of teacher enjoyment substantially increased the
   likelihood that a teacher would endorse teaching with challenging tasks
   more than once a week; however, higher levels of teaching confidence
   somewhat reduced the likelihood. Implications for practice are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This article illustrates the role of teacher identity in teacher
   self-efficacy development during initial teacher education. It has been
   posited that teacher self-efficacy develops on the basis of information
   accessed through four self-efficacy sources: vicarious and enactive
   experiences, social persuasion, and physiological and affective states,
   and by interacting with a myriad of personal and external factors. The
   very process of teacher self-efficacy development, however, is not well
   understood. This phenomenological longitudinal qualitative case study
   contributes to addressing this issue by illustrating how a pre-service
   secondary mathematics teacher's teacher self-efficacy is affected by the
   way she sees herself. More specifically, the study illustrates how
   aspects of a strong student teacher identity negatively affect the
   pre-service teacher's teacher self-efficacy appraisal, and how her
   teacher identity, emerging through the processes of autonomous role
   enactment and social verification, supports teacher self-efficacy
   development.},

Abstract = {Online collaborative and content-focused professional development (PD)
   is becoming an increasingly important setting for supporting mathematics
   teachers' professional learning. The purpose of this study was to better
   understand the process by which a community emerges in such a PD setting
   by examining how the cohesiveness of 21 mathematics teachers' social
   network evolves and associated shifts in the quality of mathematics
   teachers' mathematical discourse. We employed social network analysis
   (SNA) to examine the evolving cohesiveness of mathematics teachers'
   social network and coding procedures to examine teachers' mathematical
   discourse. A key finding was the documentation of an emergent divide
   between participation in the core and periphery during initial weeks of
   the PD and then a reduced divide and emergence of a social network that
   resembles a community. We argue that the instructor's pattern of
   participation that included distributing their interactions across the
   subgroups while sending a common message regarding expectations for
   mathematical discourse in the PD may have contributed to the community
   formation process. We propose the Interaction Assessment Model, which
   outlines an approach for PD facilitators to use SNA as a feedback
   mechanism to differentiate facilitation of online collaborative and
   content-focused PD and build online communities.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of teacher
   education by examining instructional visions of graduates from a teacher
   education program, 2 or 3 years post-graduation. An instructional vision
   is a teacher's idealized image of teaching practice, encompassing
   aspirations and hopes of what could occur in her classroom. We conducted
   an inductive analysis of participants' self-reports of: (1) their
   instructional visions for teaching elementary mathematics, (2) whether
   their visions changed over time, (3) whether teacher education
   influenced changes in their visions, and (4) what their teacher
   education program promoted as an ideal instructional vision. We
   administered an open-ended questionnaire to 81 graduates from two
   cohorts of the same teacher education program. Using latent class
   analysis, we identified three profiles. Two profiles (89\% of the
   participants) appeared to align with teacher education, suggesting more
   than one manifestation of the impact of teacher education. Our results
   indicated alignment between instructional visions and teacher education
   experiences with respect to teaching mathematics for conceptual
   understanding and engaging students in productive struggle. A
   contribution of this study is an awareness that teacher education
   programs could impact the instructional visions of their graduates in
   more than one way, with different subsets of intended visions remaining
   as residue. We conjectured that experiencing instruction that aligned
   with these instructional visions as learners while in teacher education
   influenced the development of these graduates' visions.},

Abstract = {Mathematics education researchers have investigated mathematics anxiety
   in prospective elementary teachers. While many of these studies have
   focused on the bodily sensations and emotions of mathematics anxiety,
   particularly those felt in assessment situations, opportunities remain
   to investigate how prospective elementary teachers interpret their
   experiences with mathematics anxiety and connect them over time to
   compose personal histories of mathematics anxiety. Currently, over 90 \%
   of elementary teachers in US schools are women, and women have been
   shown to suffer more from mathematics anxiety than do men. In this
   article, I analyze how one woman prospective elementary teacher
   described, explained, and related her experiences of mathematics anxiety
   across her personal narratives of learning mathematics as a K-12 student
   and of learning to teach mathematics as a college student in a teacher
   preparation program. My research demonstrates that experiences of
   mathematics anxiety may persist beyond assessment situations to
   influence women prospective elementary teachers' larger mathematical
   histories. I also show that women prospective elementary teachers may
   interpret mathematics anxiety as specific fears (e.g., loss of
   opportunities for social participation) and may develop particular
   coping strategies related to those fears. Finally, I point out that
   while a coping strategy may be used consistently across K-12 mathematics
   learning and undergraduate teacher preparation, and may even offer a
   woman prospective elementary teacher some relief from mathematics
   anxiety, it may also limit her mathematics learning and professional
   development. To conclude, I present implications of my research for
   mathematics teacher educators.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Providing high-quality mathematics instruction is vital for children
   because early mathematics skills are a strong predictor of later
   academic success. Unfortunately, not all early childhood preservice
   teachers (PSTs) have positive attitudes toward mathematics and, as a
   group, report one of the highest levels of mathematics anxiety (Bates,
   A. B., Latham, N. I., and Kim, J. A. (2013). Do I have to teach math?
   Early childhood preservice teachers' fears of teaching mathematics.
   Issues in the Undergraduate Mathematics Preparation of School Teachers,

   (2015). Math anxiety: A factor in math achievement not to be ignored.
   Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 2(1), 4-12.
   10.1177/2372732215601438). Nonetheless, very few studies have looked at
   early childhood mathematics teachers as a group with specific knowledge,
   skills, and beliefs (Parks and Wager, Journal of Early Childhood Teacher
   Education 36:124-141, 2015). This study investigated associations among
   teacher characteristics (e.g., age, educational level), mathematics
   anxiety, beliefs, pedagogy, and attitudes toward mathematics.
   Significant differences were found in teachers' mathematics anxiety by
   PSTs' age but not level of education. The level of education was able to
   predict PSTs reform-based beliefs and positive attitudes toward
   mathematics. In light of these findings, it is essential to support both
   positive attitudes and inquiry-based instructional methods in PSTs to
   encourage the development of teachers who are confident and competent in
   teaching mathematics (Lake \& Kelly, Lake and Kelly, Journal of Early
   Childhood Teacher Education 35:262-275, 2014).},

Title = {The professional identities of prospective mathematics teachers who
   teach through programming},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 16},
Abstract = {As has been the case in many countries around the world, the new
   Norwegian curriculum from 2020 included programming as part of
   mathematics education. However, little is known about how prospective
   teachers perceive this addition in regard to their developing
   professional identities. When the results from an electronic survey of
   394 prospective teachers showed unexpected findings, five of the
   subjects were asked to participate in a focus group interview in order
   to explore some of these results. The focus group interview was
   conducted to understand how prospective teachers considered the past,
   present and future aspects of their professional identities as teachers
   of mathematics through programming. The results reveal that, although
   the prospective teachers had little experience of programming, they were
   positive regarding its implementation in mathematics lessons because
   they identified themselves as digital natives; they therefore believed
   that learning to program would be easy. They aligned themselves with
   their students, as masters of technology, in contrast to their future
   colleagues, whom they implicitly described as digital immigrants. The
   findings of this study have implications for teacher education. Even if
   the prospective teachers have a positive attitude toward programming and
   consider themselves digitally competent, a limited understanding of how
   programming can be integrated into their mathematics teaching will
   affect the identities that they see for themselves as teachers who teach
   mathematics through programming.},

Title = {Coach learning to help teachers learn to enact conceptually rich,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {321-346},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a strong, standards-based call for
   improving what mathematics is taught and how it is taught. In the USA,
   districts have hired instructional coaches to help teachers shift their
   teaching from algorithm-based instruction to instruction that is more
   student-centered and conceptually focused. The purpose of this study was
   to contribute to the field's understanding of (a) the specific coaching
   practices that help teachers enact more conceptual-based forms of
   instruction; and (b) how coaches learn to enact those practices. Using a
   design-based implementation research approach, we trained coaches using
   a particular model for one-on-one coaching (Content-Focused Coaching);
   the coaches then worked with teachers to plan lessons aligned with the
   coaching model. Data consisted of videotapes of pre-lesson conferences
   that were transcribed and coded according to the model. Analyses of 32
   coaches' practice over a 2-year period suggest that each of the three
   components of our coaching model (attention to student thinking,
   pedagogy, and mathematics) demonstrated statistically significant
   improvement over time. An illustrative analysis of five coaching
   sessions of one coach revealed a progression over five sessions from
   planning discussions that stayed at the level of general strategies to
   more specific conversations about teaching a particular task and then to
   deeper discussions that integrate attention to mathematical concepts,
   student thinking, and pedagogical moves. We view this delineation of
   coach learning as an important first step in laying the groundwork for
   the design of future coach training.},

Abstract = {During the last three decades, scholars have proposed several conceptual
   structures to represent teacher knowledge. A common denominator in this
   work is the assumption that disciplinary knowledge and the knowledge
   needed for teaching are distinct. However, empirical findings on the
   distinguishability of these two knowledge components, and their
   relationship with student outcomes, are mixed. In this replication and
   extension study, we explore these issues, drawing on evidence from a
   multi-year study of over 200 fourth- and fifth-grade US teachers.
   Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of these data suggested a
   single dimension for teacher knowledge. Value-added models predicting
   student test outcomes on both state tests and a test with cognitively
   challenging tasks revealed that teacher knowledge positively predicts
   student achievement gains. We consider the implications of these
   findings for teacher selection and education.},

Abstract = {The effective teaching and learning of mathematics through mathematical
   modeling and connecting mathematics to the real world has gained rapid
   growth at various educational levels all over the world. The growth in
   modeling practices in the United States of America (US) and the
   international community is the result of the development and
   implementation of new mathematics standards and curricula across the
   world. In this article, we report on the development and use of a
   quantitative instrument aimed at assessing teachers of mathematics
   attitudes toward mathematical modeling practices. Based on the responses
   of 310 practicing teachers of mathematics from the US, the mathematical
   modeling attitude scale was evaluated using item analysis, exploratory
   factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and other psychometric
   properties. The scale isolated four dimensions: constructivism,
   understanding, relevance and real-life, and motivation and interest.
   These 4 factors accounted for 59\% of the variation in the 28-item
   measure. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the overall scale was .96, and
   that for the subscales was .93 for constructivism, .81 for
   understanding, .88 for relevance and real-life, and .89 for motivation
   and interest. The findings suggest a psychometrically useable, reliable,
   and valid scale for studying teacher's attitudes toward mathematical
   modeling. We discuss the instrument's merit for research and teaching,
   and implications for teacher education, professional development, and
   future research.},

Title = {Promoting teacher learning: a framework for evaluating the educative
   features of mathematics curriculum materials},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {351-385},

Abstract = {Educative curricula, curriculum materials that intentionally foster
   teacher professional development, can serve as a site for teacher
   learning through their use in daily instructional practices. The present
   article introduces a framework, Teacher Learning Opportunities in
   Mathematics Curriculum Materials (TLO-Math), for designing and
   evaluating mathematics curriculum materials' educative features
   according to seven theoretically based variables: (1) mathematics
   content knowledge for teaching, (2) teacher knowledge of student
   thinking in mathematics, (3) teacher knowledge of disciplinary discourse
   in mathematics, (4) teacher knowledge of assessment in mathematics, (5)
   teacher knowledge of differentiated instruction in mathematics, (6)
   teacher knowledge of technology use in mathematics, and (7) teacher
   knowledge of mathematical community. Each variable is illustrated with a
   definition, guiding questions, discipline-specific literature, and
   examples from two sets of elementary mathematics curriculum materials.
   The development of the TLO-Math framework is a critical first step for
   further study of the use of mathematics curriculum materials as sites
   for teacher learning.},

Abstract = {In this article, we report on Researching Mathematics Leader Learning
   (RMLL), a project designed to support leaders in learning how to
   facilitate robust opportunities for teachers' mathematical learning. Our
   two-phase research design allowed us to construct a set of videocase
   seminars, enact the seminar design with leaders, analyze these data,
   refine our seminar design, and implement a second set of seminars with a
   new group of leaders. We drew on the noticing literature to examine
   leaders' pedagogical reasoning as they discussed videocases of
   professional development. In this article, we demonstrate how changes in
   our framework for leader development and the resulting changes in the
   prompts and tasks shaped leader noticing in three ways: (a) accounting
   for the mathematical work of the facilitator and teachers in the
   videocase; (b) linking the mathematical work to goals for teacher
   learning; and (c) reasoning around the facilitator's work in advancing
   those learning goals. Analysis indicates that in Phase II, leader
   discussions were more focused on the mathematical and pedagogical work
   needed to advance teacher learning. Based on our research and
   development work with over 70 leaders, we offer a set of design
   principles for leader professional development.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to characterize profiles of the teaching
   competence ``noticing students' mathematical thinking{''} in the context
   of the pattern generalization. Prospective primary teachers were asked
   to describe and interpret the answers of three primary students to three
   linear pattern generalization problems. Five profiles for this
   competence have been identified. Prospective teachers named various
   mathematical elements to describe the students' answers but did not
   always use them to interpret the understanding of pattern generalization
   of each student. Furthermore, this teaching competence ranges from the
   PPTs who could not recognize the understanding of the primary students
   to those capable of recognizing degrees of primary students'
   understanding. Our findings allow one to generate descriptors of the
   development of this teaching competence and provide information for the
   design of interventions in teacher education addressed to support the
   recognition of evidence of students' mathematical understanding.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 6},
Abstract = {Eliciting and attending to students' thinking is an important component
   of teaching mathematics for understanding. Clinical interview protocols
   have shown the potential to support teachers in developing these skills.
   However, less is known about how to support teacher leaders' knowledge
   and development of these skills. Given that teacher leaders provide
   opportunities to foster teachers' knowledge of these ideas, more needs
   to be known about teacher leaders' abilities and knowledge in this area,
   and how clinical interviews might support teacher leaders' pedagogical
   knowledge. This study explored the nuances in understanding the ways in
   which teacher leaders elicited and attended to student thinking when
   conducting clinical interviews. Findings show that while the majority of
   teacher leaders who engaged in conducting clinical interviews asked
   probing questions and engaged in observational thinking, they also faced
   challenges in moving toward responsive listening, particularly when
   students struggled with providing justification for a task.},

Title = {The role of mathematics teachers' previous professional experiences in
   their collaborative sensemaking: an ecological perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Educational researchers widely acknowledge the promises and impediments
   of teachers' collaborative sensemaking, illuminating the need to
   recognize additional resources that are salient for teachers within
   professional interactions. In line with this overarching goal, this
   study explores the role of mathematics teachers' previous professional
   experiences in their collaborative sensemaking. Theoretically, it is
   rooted in ecological theories of learning, highlighting that learning is
   always shaped by an interconnected set of environments. Empirically, it
   builds on data from a research-practice partnership with a professional
   development (PD) organization, where we used classroom video to support
   secondary mathematics teachers' teams in improving their practice. The
   analysis first portrays two video-based conversations to illustrate the
   potential of inviting and building on teachers' previous experiences and
   resources to support their collaborative reasoning. Then, it looks
   across nine video-based conversations of the same two teams and
   systematically describes experiences and resources that teachers
   spontaneously reference through six categories: PD workshops,
   conferences, PD organizations, online resources, research and policy,
   and curricula. These categories provide a framework for designers and
   facilitators who want to take seriously the practice of acknowledging
   that teacher learning happens through a complex web of learning
   experiences. The study brings forth the affordances of taking a learning
   ecology perspective on teacher collaborative sensemaking as professional
   development (CSPD) and provides guidance for designing, facilitating,
   and analyzing CSPD conversations in ways that center on teachers' prior
   knowledge and experiences.},

Title = {Algebra-focused features of instruction: an integrated investigation of
   curricular guidance and instructional enactment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 11},
Abstract = {To be successful in algebra, students need access to high-quality
   instruction that includes opportunities to develop their algebraic
   understanding. Yet research on algebra teaching suggests that
   instruction remains procedurally focused, indicating that teachers may
   need additional support to provide students such opportunities. One
   possible lever for improving instruction may be through curricular
   guidance provided to teachers, specifically through educative materials
   that provide support for teacher as well as student learning. This study
   aims to understand how curricular guidance supports teachers to enact
   the types of instructional practices that support students' learning
   opportunities in algebra specifically, and how teachers enact that
   guidance. We draw from a sample of 29 video observations from six
   teachers of the same three textbook lessons and use aligned analytic
   frameworks to examine the curriculum materials and enacted lessons in
   tandem. We investigate how the curricular guidance provides
   opportunities for algebra-focused instructional features, how these
   opportunities are taken up by teachers, and how and in what ways
   differences in instructional enactments might be related to the
   curricular opportunities. We find differences in which instructional
   features varied more by lesson and which varied more by teacher and
   describe sources of this variation. Curricular guidance supported
   teachers' enactments, but teacher-level variation was largely due to
   teachers going beyond the support provided. This study suggests how
   curriculum materials can better support teacher learning and provides
   insight into taking a content-focused approach to studying curricular
   enactment.},

Title = {High school mathematics teachers' noticing of inequitable talk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 5},
Abstract = {To make instructional decisions that interrupt inequitable talk in the
   classroom, teachers must notice it in the first place. In a two-year
   Professional Learning Experience (PLE) focused on the core practice of
   facilitating equitable discussions, we found that two different groups
   of math teachers took up the work of noticing for equity in different
   ways and with varying degrees of success. We analyzed teachers' written
   goals for teaching, videos of their in-person classroom instruction,
   video recordings of their coaching sessions, and sets of video
   annotations. Our findings indicate that teachers who noticed for equity:
   (1) engaged in conversations about status and identity (2) had more
   student-centered goals, and (3) were more likely to select ``bumpy
   moments{''} of their instruction to discuss in coaching sessions. These
   findings have implications for instructional coaches, teacher educators,
   and professional learning facilitators interested in supporting teachers
   with noticing inequitable talk in their classrooms.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Pedagogical beliefs are a critical factor in terms of integrating
   technology into teaching, but very few technology acceptance models
   (TAMs) have considered them. Hence, this study aims to extend the TAM by
   incorporating pre-service teachers' conception of teaching and learning.
   The revised model examined the influence of pre-service mathematics
   teachers' constructivist and traditional pedagogical beliefs on their
   technology acceptance through perceived ease of use, perceived
   usefulness, attitude toward technology, and behavioral intention to use.
   Survey data were collected from 714 pre-service mathematics teachers in
   Turkey and analyzed through path analysis. The results showed that
   pre-service mathematics teachers' pedagogical beliefs were more
   constructivist-oriented than traditional-oriented, and constructivist
   beliefs had a significant influence on the components of the TAM. On the
   other hand, pre-service teachers' traditional-oriented beliefs did not
   influence their perceived usefulness of and attitudes toward technology
   but had positive effects on perceived ease of use. Implications for
   pre-service mathematics teacher education were discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the second phase of a multi-university research
   project focusing on improving secondary prospective mathematics
   teachers' abilities to respond to student thinking. This work is based
   on an Interview Module, created by the authors, which showed gains in
   prospective teachers' (PSTs) abilities to attend to and interpret
   student thinking but did not show the same gains in their abilities to
   respond to student thinking. The Interview Module originally included a
   pre-post-video, readings, discussion, and one-on-one interview with a
   secondary student (Lesseig et al. in Math Teach Educ 5(1):29-46, 2016).
   This second phase adds a take-home assignment based on solutions from
   the secondary students who were interviewed in Phase 1. This take-home
   assignment was designed to specifically improve PSTs' abilities to
   respond to student thinking. Results indicate that gains were made in
   their ability to respond, as was intended, but, unexpectedly, greater
   gains were also found in their abilities to attend to and interpret
   student thinking compared with Phase 1.},

Abstract = {In this study, we report on what types of mathematical knowledge for
   teaching teachers (MKTT) mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) use and
   develop when they work together and reflect on their teaching in a
   Community of Practice while helping prospective primary teachers (PTs)
   generate their own mathematical knowledge for teaching in learning
   mathematics via problem solving. Two novice MTEs worked with an
   experienced MTE and reflected on the process of learning to teach via
   problem solving and supporting PTs in developing deep understandings of
   foundational mathematical ideas. Taking a position of inquiry as stance,
   we examined our experiences teaching mathematics content courses for PTs
   via problem solving. We found that all of the MTEs used and developed
   some MKTT through (a) understanding and deciding on the mathematical
   goals of both the individual lessons and the two-course sequence as a
   whole, (b) choosing and facilitating tasks, and (c) using questions to
   scaffold PTs learning and engage them in mathematical processes such as
   making conjectures, justifying their reasoning, and proving or
   disproving conjectures.},

Title = {Developing culturally responsive mathematics teachers: secondary
   teachers' evolving conceptions of knowing students},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Research advances in teaching, learning, curriculum, and assessment have
   not changed the continued underperformance of marginalized students in
   mathematics education. Culturally responsive teaching is a means of
   addressing the needs of these students. It is sometimes challenging,
   however, to convince secondary mathematics teachers about the importance
   of culture in mathematics education. To contribute to what is known
   about supporting secondary mathematics teachers in developing a
   culturally responsive teaching practice, we studied the impacts of a
   graduate course called Culture in the Mathematics Classroom on 13
   teachers enrolled in the course. The course was designed to guide
   secondary mathematics teachers in understanding and growing their
   capacity to enact culturally responsive teaching in their classrooms.
   The purpose of our research was to explore how teachers' perceptions
   changed as a result of their engagement in the class with respect to
   understanding the role of culture in knowing and being responsive to
   their students. Specifically, we examined how each of the four course
   projects seemed to individually and collectively influence teachers'
   thinking. Overall, teachers appeared to expand their cultural awareness
   and dispositions for cultural responsiveness that would support them in
   knowing and supporting their students in the manner of a culturally
   responsive teacher. Teachers did not, however, develop some more
   ``advanced{''} understandings related to power and privilege in society.
   This study provides researchers and mathematics teacher educators with a
   potential analytic framework for understanding teacher change with
   respect to culturally responsive teaching.},

Abstract = {This study investigated a highly accomplished third-grade teacher's
   noticing of students' mathematical thinking as she taught multiplication
   and division. Through an innovative method, which allowed for
   documenting in-the-moment teacher noticing, the author was able to
   explore teacher noticing and reflective practices in the context of
   classroom teaching as opposed to professional development environments.
   Noticing was conceptualized as both attending to different elements of
   classroom instruction and making sense of classroom events. The teacher
   paid most attention to student thinking and was able to offer a variety
   of rich interpretations of student thinking which were presented in an
   emergent framework. The results also indicated how the teacher's
   noticing might influence her instructional decisions. Implications for
   both research methods in studying noticing and teacher learning and
   practices are discussed.},

Abstract = {In prior work, we fit the mixture Rasch model to item responses from a
   fractions survey administered to a nationwide sample of middle grades
   mathematics teachers in the United States. The mixture Rasch model
   located teachers on a continuous, unidimensional scale and fit best with
   3 latent classes. We used item response data to generate initial
   interpretations of the reasoning characteristic of each latent class.
   Our results suggested increasing facility reasoning about fraction
   arithmetic from one class to the next. The present study contributes two
   further arguments for the validity of our initial interpretations.
   First, we administered the same survey to a new sample of future middle
   grades mathematics teachers before and after 20 weeks of instruction on
   multiplication, division, and fractions, and we found that from pretest
   to posttest future teachers transitioned from one latent class to
   another in ways consistent with increased proficiency in fraction
   arithmetic. Second, we interviewed 8 of the future teachers before and
   after the instruction and found that future teachers' reasoning during
   interviews was largely consistent with our original interpretation of
   the 3 latent classes. These results provide further support for our
   original interpretation of the mixture Rasch analysis, demonstrate the
   utility of our approach for capturing growth and change in future
   teachers' reasoning during teacher education coursework, and contribute
   innovative applications of psychometric models for surveying teachers'
   reasoning at scale.},

Title = {Profiles of teachers' expertise in professional noticing of children's
   mathematical thinking},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 22},
Abstract = {This study contributes to the growing body of research that highlights
   the usefulness of professional noticing of children's mathematical
   thinking for understanding the complexity and variability in teaching
   expertise. We explored the noticing expertise of 72 upper elementary
   school teachers engaged in multi-year professional development focused
   on children's fraction thinking. Our assessment addressed the three
   component skills of professional noticing of children's mathematical
   thinking: (a) attending to children's strategy details, (b) interpreting
   children's understandings, and (c) deciding how to respond on the basis
   of children's understandings. We used a latent class analysis to
   empirically identify three distinct ``profiles{''} of noticing
   expertise-subgroups of teachers who responded similarly to each other
   and differently from teachers in other profiles. The profiles differed
   in their overall noticing expertise as well as their patterns of
   strengths and areas for growth across the component skills. Thus, the
   profiles provide a concise, multi-dimensional characterization of
   noticing expertise that integrates expertise in each of the component
   skills. The profiles also provide tools for differentiating learning
   opportunities for teachers in professional development. In addition, our
   design allowed us to compare teachers' expertise in two common forms of
   deciding how to respond: deciding on follow-up questions and deciding on
   next problems. In all three profiles, teachers demonstrated more
   expertise when deciding on follow-up questions than when deciding on
   next problems, suggesting not only a starting point for teacher learning
   but also the need for a line of research focused on different forms of
   this component skill.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine deficit talk, utterances that depict students
   and/or families based on their perceived deficits, in an equity-oriented
   professional development (PD) setting. Researchers often attribute
   deficit talk by mathematics teachers (MTs) to their biased beliefs and
   perceptions. From an interactional approach, namely conversation
   analysis and discursive psychology, I offer an alternative perspective
   on how deficit talk is produced in PD interactions. The analysis shows
   the rhetorical functions of deficit talk, which are designed for MTs to
   manage their accountability with a range of potential issues and to
   portray themselves as competent teachers. The analysis also reveals the
   action-performing nature of deficit talk (e.g., refusing a request)
   situated in the social interaction. To conclude, this paper suggests
   that mathematics teacher educators need to attend to the micropolitical
   nature of deficit talk and their co-participation in the production of
   deficit talk as they formulate ways to respond to deficit talk in PD
   interactions.},

Abstract = {This qualitative survey study set out to investigate in-service and
   pre-service primary school teachers' perceived barriers to and enablers
   for the integration of children's literature in mathematics teaching and
   learning in an Australian educational context. While research over the
   past three decades have documented pedagogical benefits of teaching
   mathematics using children's literature, research into teachers'
   perceptions regarding the use of such resources is virtually
   non-existent. The study thus filled this research gap by drawing
   responses from open-ended survey questions of 94 in-service and 82
   pre-service teachers in Australia. A thematic analysis revealed 13
   perceived barriers classified under five themes with Lack of Pedagogical
   Knowledge and Confidence, and Time Constraint, representing 75\% of all
   perceived barriers. Moreover, 14 perceived enablers were identified and
   classified under five themes with Pedagogical Benefits and Love of
   Stories representing around 70\% of all perceived enablers. Findings
   also showed that most of the teachers in the study (around 75\%) never
   or infrequently used children's literature in their mathematics
   classrooms. The study highlights the role of professional learning and
   teacher training in ensuring that both in- and pre-service teachers have
   the necessary pedagogical knowledge, experience and confidence in using
   children's literature to enrich their mathematics teaching.},

Abstract = {Studies of facilitators of professional development (PD) for mathematics
   teachers have been increasing in order to improve their preparation for
   conducting PD. However, specifications of what facilitators should learn
   often lack a conceptualization that captures facilitators' expertise for
   different PD content. In this article, we provide a framework for
   facilitator expertise that is in line with current conceptualizations
   but makes explicit the content-related aspects of such expertise. The
   framework for content-related facilitator expertise combines cognitive
   and situated perspectives and allows unpacking different components at
   the PD level and the classroom level. Using two illustrative cases of
   different PD content (probability education in primary school and
   language-responsive mathematics teaching in secondary school), we
   exemplify how the framework can help to analyze facilitators' practices
   in content-related ways in a descriptive mode. This analysis reveals
   valuable insights that support designers of facilitator preparation
   programs to specify what facilitators should learn in a prescriptive
   mode. We particularly emphasize the importance of working on
   content-related aspects, unpacking the PD content goals into the content
   knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge elements on the classroom
   level and developing facilitators' pedagogical content knowledge on the
   PD level (PCK-PD), which includes curricular knowledge, as well as
   knowledge about teachers' typical thinking about a specific PD content.
   Situated learning opportunities in facilitator preparation programs can
   support facilitators to activate these knowledge elements for managing
   typical situational demands in PD.},

Abstract = {This study compares web usage data with interviews from 41 participants,
   who are members of an online professional development site called the
   Everyday Mathematics Virtual Learning Community (VLC), to explore how
   elementary school teachers learn from classroom video. Web usage data
   reveal that the commentary surrounding video posted to the VLC is sparse
   and surface level, possibly indicating a lack of serious attention to
   the videos. Interview data, however, indicate that participants felt
   they learned from this resource. Participants reported that the videos
   provided them with the opportunity to view and reflect on model lessons,
   plan curricula, and consider student thinking, among other learning
   outcomes. Participants also identified key factors that prevented them
   from posting comments to the site to convey their learning. These
   results can be used to understand not only how teachers perceive their
   own learning from classroom video, but also to redesign online
   professional development experiences to promote expression of that
   learning.},

Abstract = {Justifying and generalizing are essential forms of mathematical
   reasoning, yet, teachers struggle both to produce and identify
   justifications and generalizations. In comparing elementary school
   teachers' self-reported levels of noticing justifying and generalizing
   in their own classrooms and the levels researchers observed in two
   consecutive lessons in those classrooms, we found significant
   discrepancies. In applying a framework we developed to characterize the
   teachers' noticing in terms of mathematical content and reasoning form,
   we found that teachers rarely attended to justifying and generalizing in
   a manner consistent with the mathematics education community's view and
   that their lenses for noticing these activities may account for
   discrepancies between the teachers' reports and the researchers'
   observations. We conclude by reflecting on the complexity of asking
   teachers to attend to justifying and generalizing and how these results
   may affect teacher professional development.},

Title = {Angle measure, quantitative reasoning, and instructional coherence: an

Abstract = {This paper reports findings from a study that establishes empirical
   support for Harel's (Zentralblatt fur Didaktik der Math 40:893-907
   2008b) inclusion of mathematical ways of thinking as a component of
   teachers' professional knowledge base. Specifically, we examined the
   role of quantitative reasoning (Smith and Thompson, in: Kaput, Carraher,
   Blanton (eds) Algebra in the early grades, Erlbaum, New York 2007;
   Thompson, in: A theoretical model of quantity-based reasoning in
   arithmetic and algebra, Center for Research in Mathematics \& Science
   Education: San Diego State University 1990; Thompson, in: Hatfield et al
   (eds) New perspectives and directions for collaborative research in
   mathematics education, University of Wyoming, Laramie 2011) on the
   quality and coherence of an experienced secondary teacher's instruction
   of angle measure. We analyzed 37 videos of the teacher's instruction to
   characterize the extent to which he attended to supporting students in
   reasoning about angle measure quantitatively, and to examine the
   consequences of this attention on the quality and coherence of the
   meanings the teacher's instruction supported. Our analysis revealed that
   the inconsistent meanings the teacher conveyed were occasioned by his
   lack of awareness of the conceptual affordances of students'
   quantitative reasoning on their ability to construct coherent,
   meaningful understandings of angle measure. Our findings therefore
   support Harel's notion that teachers' mathematical ways of thinking
   constitute an essential component of their specialized content
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {This study investigated relationships between changes in certain types
   of coaching knowledge and practices among mathematics classroom coaches
   and how these explain changes in the attitudes, knowledge, and practice
   of the teachers they coach. Participants in this study were 51
   school-based mathematics classroom coaches in the USA and 180 of the
   teachers whom they coached between 2009 and 2014. The participating
   coaches were recruited from schools that hired their own coaches
   independently from this research project. This study found evidence that
   improvements in coaches' use of practices recommended by particular
   coaching models are related to improvements in teachers' mathematical
   knowledge for teaching. The study also found that improvements in
   coaches' self-assessment of their own coaching skills are related to
   improvements in teachers' mathematics content knowledge for teaching,
   mathematics teaching practices, and attitudes about self-efficacy for
   teaching mathematics. The study did not detect relationships between
   changes in coaches' mathematics knowledge and changes in teachers'
   knowledge or practices.},

Abstract = {This article describes the research landscape related to the use of
   video for promoting teacher learning, drawing on a variety of research
   studies to illustrate the breadth of approaches that have been employed.
   One particular research study is reported in some detail since, it is
   argued, this represents a new level of devolution of agency to teachers
   to play a self-scaffolding role in their own professional education. The
   study involved the investigation of an approach to the provision of
   feedback to teachers about their practice that involved stimulating
   teacher self-reflection and juxtaposed structure and agency. An
   observation framework grounded in classroom practice research was
   developed, and teachers selected elements of that framework to serve as
   the focus for examining their practice and seeking feedback about that
   practice. Teachers and researchers examined video-recorded lessons
   focusing on the teachers' selected observation elements, and then
   engaged in feedback conversations about their observations and analyses,
   and the implications of these for future practice. The approach
   identified the video record as an artefact of the teacher's own practice
   and one which demanded a professional response from the teacher. The
   balance between structure and agency realised in the study, in
   combination with the use of video for observation and analysis of
   practice, facilitated teacher self-reflection and functioned to both
   support and provoke teacher learning.},

Abstract = {The scalability and accessibility of quality professional development
   (PD) is an ongoing concern in the teacher education community, yet
   little research has been conducted on potential solutions. We aimed to
   address this gap by developing an interactive, virtual PD program that
   uses intelligent tutoring systems and provides instant feedback to
   teachers. We then explored the role of this program in developing
   teachers' content and pedagogical content knowledge of mathematics. We
   collected data from 60 teachers located across the USA and found that
   those who completed the program increased their content and pedagogical
   content knowledge.},

Title = {Utilising personas as a methodological approach to support prospective
   mathematics teachers' adaptation and development of digital mathematics
   learning resources},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Personas, initially originated in user experience research, are short
   and simplified representations of particular user groups, and this
   methodological approach has recently gained ground in educational
   research. This study aims to explore aspects of personas that may be
   beneficial for prospective mathematics teachers when they develop
   digital learning resources. To explore such aspects, we employed
   qualitative interviews, thinking-out-loud techniques, and jointly
   developed learning resources with prospective mathematics teachers, and
   analysed this diverse data with a combination of case study and grounded
   theory approaches. Consequently, we were able to identify the following
   essential aspects of using personas in our study: (A) personas as
   representatives of real people, (B) personas as planning \& feedback
   tools for material development, (C) professionalisation of prospective
   mathematics teachers (by using personas), (D)
   differentiation/individualisation for personas through digital learning
   resources, and (E) motivational elements of digital mathematics learning
   resources. Based on our results, we concluded that using personas could
   broaden prospective mathematics teachers' views on student
   characteristics and demands that may enable teachers to facilitate the
   development of differentiated and individualised digital mathematics
   learning resources.},

Title = {A prospective teacher's conceptions about the nature of mathematical
   tasks and professional knowledge within task unfolding},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 11},
Abstract = {This qualitative study aimed to identify the changes in a prospective'
   conceptions about the nature of mathematical tasks and pedagogy in video
   cases and to investigate the characteristics of the prospective'
   professional knowledge and views during task design/modification. The
   study used the mathematical task demand engagement process, which
   includes task-sorting activity, selecting tasks, reflecting on
   illustrative cases, and teaching and reflecting on tasks as enacted. The
   findings regarding one prospective, Kar, were reported. Focus group
   interviews, individual interviews, and two recorded lessons were used as
   data sources. The content analysis method was employed for the in-depth
   analysis of the data. The findings suggested a change in Kar's ideas
   about the nature of mathematical tasks, particularly about what
   characteristics low and high-level tasks possess and the efficiency of
   the Task Analysis Guide. Kar also generated detailed ideas on the
   pedagogy of high and low tasks and realized the role of teachers as
   facilitators while enacting high-level tasks. Another finding is that
   Kar's decisions regarding task adaptation and her reasons catalyze both
   situated and global knowledge and views. Our findings suggest that
   providing an opportunity for prospective to reflect on and discuss the
   nature of mathematical tasks as planned, implemented, and revisited in a
   professional context is beneficial.},

Abstract = {In response to recent trends in the field of mathematics education,
   real-world contexts are frequently found in curricula and classrooms
   across the world. Numerous scholars contend that, in addition to making
   instruction more engaging and relevant, rich, imaginable contexts can
   provide a semantic grounding that helps students deeply understand
   abstract mathematical ideas. To achieve this form of understanding, A.
   Thompson et al. (1994) describe the need for conceptually oriented
   teaching, aimed at supporting students in maintaining connection between
   numerical values and operations and the quantities and relationships to
   which they refer. We elaborate the construct of conceptually oriented
   teaching through an empirical analysis of two teachers' instruction
   around a context-based ratio instructional sequence. More specifically,
   we differentiate between two types of explicit contextualization present
   within conceptually oriented explanations: contextualized quantities and
   contextualized operating. We identify the importance of a particular
   teacher move, pressing for contextualized operating, that aims to
   explicitly ground students' use of representations to their common sense
   understanding of the problem context. We describe two ways that the
   teachers work to make the contextualization explicit in the classroom
   discourse and argue that this explicit contextualization is essential in
   order for all students to have the opportunity to experience the
   contexts as supportive of conceptual development.},

Abstract = {Problem solving is a key priority in school mathematics. Central to the
   valuable role played by problem solving is the quality of the problems
   posed. While we recognize the features of good problems and how to
   support learners in solving problems, less is known about the ways in
   which prospective teachers' (PTs) conceptions of what constitutes a
   `good' problem develop within the confines of an Initial Teacher
   Education program. This study explored the effect of engagement in a
   mathematics education course on the problem-posing skills of 415
   prospective primary teachers. A 3-week instructional unit consisting of
   a series of lectures and tutorials on problem solving and problem posing
   was implemented. A questionnaire examining participants' understandings
   of and ability to pose problems was administered prior to and following
   instruction. Results reveal that participation brought improvements in
   conceptions of what constituted a good problem and in the ability to
   pose good problems (targeted at grades 1-4). Initial problems generally
   were arithmetic, required one step to solve and had only one correct
   solution. Following the instructional unit, attention was paid to
   designing problems that had the potential of multiple strategy use,
   multiple possible correct solutions, multiple modes of representation
   and the incorporation of extraneous information. Despite these
   improvements, the complexities of problem posing and the challenges that
   persist for PTs in posing good problems are evidenced. Recommendations
   are made for the enhancement of problem-posing experiences, most notably
   developing skills in identifying mathematically worthwhile problems from
   a selection of problems or in reformulating given problems to make them
   better, that support PTs in developing the knowledge and understandings
   required to pose mathematically worthwhile problems.},

Abstract = {This study examines how teachers' discourse moves influence patterns of
   authority in the mathematics classroom. We identify changes in authority
   structure in one classroom taught by a primary mathematics teacher in
   Hong Kong. This teacher participant was one of 32 who participated in a
   larger teacher-intervention study that aimed to help teachers
   orchestrate dialogic classroom discourse for rich learning opportunities
   in mathematics. Previous research has investigated teachers' discourse
   behaviors and authority structures in mathematics classrooms, but the
   connection between the two has yet to be addressed in extant studies.
   Our analysis shows that certain features and patterns embedded in
   classroom discourse can constrain or enable certain kinds of authority
   in the classroom. This study contributes to understanding the ways in
   which dialogic discourse may influence how authority is structured,
   including how mathematics teaching and learning are enacted through
   authority styles, and how the discipline of mathematics is positioned
   from an authority perspective.},

Abstract = {This case study explored Prospective Elementary Mathematics Specialists'
   (PEMSs) pedagogical practices during a K-5 Mathematics Endorsement (K-5
   ME) program, specifically focusing on the authentic residency with
   mentor sessions. Participants included nine PEMSs, with qualitative and
   quantitative data collected via individual interviews, professional
   portfolios, and observations of classroom practices. Upon completion of
   the K-5 ME program, all participants were implementing instructional
   practices learned about in the program in substantial ways. Participants
   were honing their skills for orchestrating effective discourse, and the
   application of those skills became more meaningful as they saw the
   impact it was having on student learning. This implementation and
   documentation program coursework was rigorous as PEMSs worked to develop
   themselves as mathematics teachers and teacher leaders. The
   collaborative support during the authentic residency and mentor sessions
   seem to have been significant for PEMSs in supporting implementation of
   newly learned instructional practices. Ultimately, PEMSs completed the
   program feeling more prepared as elementary mathematics teachers and
   teacher leaders.},

Abstract = {Mathematical modelling is increasingly becoming an integral component of
   mathematical curricular in primary and secondary schools throughout the
   world. However, in Australia modelling skills are currently rarely found
   in university teacher preparation courses. Limited experience with
   modelling processes, as well as a lack of confidence and personal
   efficacy in the field of mathematics, limits the ability for prospective
   teachers of mathematics to develop into effective high school educators
   and thus concomitantly adversely affects student learning outcomes. To
   address the problems related to the lack of experience that prospective
   teachers have with mathematical modelling and the associated lack of
   confidence and personal efficacy that can result, this paper presents a
   case study of a strategy-the enhancement, learning, reflection (ELR)
   process-designed to improve prospective teachers' confidence and
   personal efficacy in teaching mathematics, with a focus on the modelling
   process as a teaching strategy.},

Abstract = {Elementary preservice teachers at six universities engaged in a task
   that provided them opportunities to articulate their professional
   noticing within video representations, written decompositions, and
   animated approximations of practice. The preservice teachers' written
   accounts indicated that a majority attended to students or student
   thinking; however, when asked to illustrate their noticing through
   animation, focus shifted to the classroom teacher. Findings indicate the
   extent to which preservice teachers articulated specific mathematics
   concepts within and across pedagogies of practice and highlight the
   critical importance for selecting and utilizing multiple types of tasks
   to better understand preservice teacher noticing. Implications for
   eliciting and supporting preservice teacher noticing are discussed.},

Title = {Can teachers and mathematicians communicate productively? The case of
   division with remainder},

Abstract = {Is it possible that a meeting of mathematicians and primary school
   teachers will be productive? This question became intriguing when one
   professor of mathematics initiated a professional development course for
   practicing primary school teachers, which he taught alongside a group of
   mathematics Ph.D. students. This report scrutinizes the uncommon meeting
   of these two communities, who have very different perspectives on
   mathematics and its teaching. The instructors had no experience in
   primary school teaching, and their professed goal was to deepen the
   teachers' understanding of the mathematics they teach, while teachers
   were expecting the course to be pedagogically relevant for their
   teaching. Surprisingly, despite this mismatch in expectations, the
   course was considered a success by teachers and instructors alike. In
   our study, we analyzed a lesson on division with remainder for teachers
   of grades 3-6, taught by the professor. The framework used for the data
   analysis was mathematical discourse for teaching, a discursive
   adaptation of the well-known mathematical knowledge for teaching
   framework. Our analysis focuses on the nature of the interactions
   between the parties and the learning opportunities they afforded. We
   show how different concerns, which might have hindered communication, in
   fact fueled discussions, leading to understandings of the topic and its

Abstract = {Previous research has adopted various approaches to examining teachers'
   and students' relationships to mathematics. The current study extended
   this line of research and investigated six prospective elementary school
   teachers' experiences in mathematics and how they saw themselves as
   learners of mathematics. One-on-one interviews with the participants
   were conducted, and their written reflections were collected. A
   grounded-theory approach and a framework for analyzing mathematics
   identities were adopted in data analysis. The findings showed that the
   participants' development of obligations-to-oneself was associated with
   not only their opportunity to exercise conceptual agency but also their
   aesthetic experience with mathematics. Their views on themselves as
   learners of mathematics had cognitive, affective, and aesthetic
   dimensions. The findings suggest that teachers and students can engage
   in a reflection on their aesthetic involvement in doing mathematics.
   There is a need for a local theory of aesthetics in K-12 mathematics.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Month = {2024 APR 3},
Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of a professional development program
   designed to develop prospective mathematics teachers' ability to notice
   students' proportional reasoning. It examines how those teachers
   attended to student thinking, how they interpreted it, and how they
   decided to respond. Sixteen prospective teachers (PSTs) at a state
   university participated in a seven-week online professional development
   (PD) program. We provided participants with a research-based framework
   for proportional reasoning and engaged them in various ways via
   interviews with middle school students. They also wrote a reflection
   paper and received feedback. Combining multiple elements with
   interviewing was a unique feature of this program. The improvement in
   participants' noticing skills was statistically significant.
   Specifically, in the post-assessment, the participants paid attention to
   most of the mathematical details of the students' strategies, provided
   interpretations supported by conceptual underpinnings and evidence, and
   made research-based student-oriented decisions that focused on key
   issues. Implications for future teacher education practices and
   suggestions for further research are provided.},

Title = {Enacting multilingual learner core practices: a PST's approximations of
   practice of mathematics language routines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 29},
Abstract = {This study considered a preservice teacher's (PST's) attention to
   multilingual learner core practices within her approximations of
   practice of mathematics language routines during a secondary mathematics
   methods course. We used a framework of approximations of practice to
   understand how a PST enacted and developed an understanding of
   multilingual learner core practices. To provide a vision for what
   multilingual learner core practices can look like in nontraditional
   instructional contexts, we qualitatively analyzed four approximations of
   practice of mathematics language routines from a single PST during a
   single semester of a methods course. We share how she navigated the
   remote teaching context and engaged sample students in all of the
   multilingual learner core practices despite the challenges of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, providing an example of what these practices may look
   like in remote instruction. We also discuss how these multilingual
   learner core practices interact and complement one another. We consider
   possible implications, limitations, and future research directions.},

Abstract = {Professional learning communities (PLC) have increasingly attracted
   attention in research on teachers' professional development. The aim of
   this study is to identify contradictions that can occur and be
   manifested in PLCs in mathematics. Identifying contradictions in PLCs
   are important, as the identification and resolution of contradictions
   are crucial to developing PLCs. We have conceptualized PLCs and
   contradictions within the Cultural Historical Activity Theory. Our data
   consist of two iterations of interviews with four teacher leader coaches
   with extensive experience of coaching teacher leaders of PLCs in
   mathematics. The study distinguishes 26 manifestations of
   contradictions, taking the overall forms of dilemmas and conflicts. Our
   results can be used in designing PLCs in mathematics: they can be used
   to make visible and increase participants' awareness of contradictions
   involved in PLCs and thereby increase the possibility that the
   contradictions serve as sources of support rather than obstacles in the
   development of PLCs in mathematics.},

Title = {Theory to practice: Prospective mathematics teachers' recontextualizing

Abstract = {Teacher education programs have a critical role in supporting
   prospective teachers' connections between theory and practice. In this
   study, we examined three prospective secondary mathematics teachers'
   discourses regarding collective argumentation during and after a unit of
   instruction addressing collective argumentation and ways they
   recontextualized their on-campus coursework (theory) into their student
   teaching (practice) as demonstrated by their support for students'
   mathematical arguments during student teaching. Through a recursive
   process of coding data from interviews, reflections, and classroom
   discussions, we constructed descriptions of participants' discourses
   about argumentation based in their coursework and identified three
   themes about collective argumentation in the prospective teachers'
   discourses: the purposes of argumentation, the role of the teacher in
   argumentation, and characteristics of effective mathematical arguments.
   Analysis using extended Toulmin diagrams of classroom data from
   participants' student teaching showed that these three interrelated
   themes were visible in the participants' enactment of moves supporting
   collective argumentation. Our study opens spaces for future
   investigations into how teachers recontextualize their learning from
   coursework (theory) into their practice.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report an enquiry into elementary preservice teachers'
   learning, as they engage in doing mathematics for themselves. As a group
   of researchers working in elementary Initial Teacher Education in
   English universities, we co-planned and taught sessions on growing
   pattern generalisation. Following the sessions, interviews of fifteen
   preservice teachers at two universities focused on their expressed
   awareness of their approach to the mathematical activity. Preservice
   teachers' prospective planning and post-teaching evaluations of similar
   activities in their classrooms were also examined. We draw on aspects of
   enactivism and the notion of reflective ``spection{''} in the context of
   teacher learning, tracing threads between preservice teachers'
   retro-spection of learning and pro-spection of teaching. Our analysis
   indicates that increasing sensitivity to their own embodied processes of
   generalisation offers opportunities for novice teachers to respond
   deliberately, rather than to react impulsively, to different pedagogical
   possibilities. The paper contributes a new dimension to the discussion
   about the focus of novice elementary school teachers' retrospective
   reflection by examining how deliberate retrospective analysis of doing
   mathematics, and not only of teaching actions, can develop awarenesses
   that underlie the growth of expertise in mathematics teaching. We argue
   that engaging preservice teachers in mathematics to support deliberate
   retrospective analysis of their mathematics learning and prospective
   consideration of the implications for teaching can enable more critical
   pedagogical choices.},

Abstract = {Existing frameworks of teachers' knowledge required to teach mathematics
   do not adequately capture the dynamic aspects of knowledge manifested in
   teaching practice. In this paper, we examine the knowledge demands that
   arise in situ, in the course of a teacher listening and responding to
   students' thinking, while teaching the topic of decimal fractions. We
   describe how contingent classroom situations pose challenges to the
   teacher, through an analysis of paired episodes, i.e. episodes of
   classroom teaching of the same sub-topic by a teacher in two consecutive
   years, with significant differences in the teacher's responsiveness to
   student thinking. We explicate the topic-specific knowledge demands
   posed on the teacher as students make connections between their prior
   knowledge of whole numbers and fractions with their emerging
   understanding of decimal fractions. We argue that an abstraction of
   knowledge demands from a close study of practice and reflection on them
   can be used to unpack the complex knowledge required by the teachers to
   teach responsively.},

Abstract = {An issue of particular concern in mathematics teacher education is the
   relationship between theory and practice, and the nature of
   university-school partnerships. We report here on results from a
   research project answering the call for a more systematic understanding
   of the practice learning context. The study focuses on the new Norwegian
   elementary teacher education programme and highlights the difficulties
   involved in connecting theory and practice and how prospective teachers
   may be supported in this respect. Focus group interviews involving 51
   first-year prospective teachers and 25 teacher-mentors investigated
   early school placements, specifically prospective teachers' positions in
   the classroom as teachers of mathematics, and the ways in which the
   mentoring relationship supported their developing role. Taking a
   communities of practice perspective, we found that the idea of movement
   across intersecting and sometimes conflicting communities of practice is
   helpful in aiding our understanding of the difficulty of connecting
   theory and practice. Additionally, variations in mentoring styles and
   perceptions of prospective teachers' mathematics and pedagogic knowledge
   competencies play a part in some prospective teachers' difficulties in
   taking up a role as legitimate peripheral participant in the school. We
   conclude by considering ways in which prospective teachers might be
   better supported to cope with school placement.},

Abstract = {The measures of mathematical knowledge for teaching developed at the
   University of Michigan in the U.S., have been adapted and used in
   studies measuring teacher knowledge in several countries around the
   world. In the adaptation, many of these studies relied on comparisons of
   item parameters and none of them considered a comparison of raw data. In
   this article, we take advantage of having access to the raw data from
   the adaptation pilot studies of the same instrument in Norway and
   Slovakia (149 practicing elementary teachers in Norway, 134 practicing
   elementary teachers in Slovakia) that allowed us to compare item
   parameters and teachers' ability estimates on the same scale.
   Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the mean scores
   between the Norwegian and the Slovak teachers in our samples and the
   paper provides further insight into the issues of cross-national
   adaptations of measures of teachers' knowledge and the limitations of
   the methods commonly applied in the item adaptation research. We show
   how item adaptations can be refined by combining robust quantitative
   methods with qualitative data, how decisions on adaptation of individual
   items depend on context and purpose of the adaptation, and how
   comparability and heterogeneity of samples affects interpretation of the
   results.},

Abstract = {Practice-based pedagogies, such as representations of practice and
   approximations of practice, are increasingly common in mathematics
   teacher education. More needs to be known about how teacher candidates'
   (TCs') productions through such activities make visible the resources
   they bring to the work of teaching. In this paper, we highlight our use
   of ``scripting tasks,{''} through which secondary mathematics TCs
   produced dialogues of classroom interactions and rationales for those
   scripts in response to a provided classroom scenario. We share how
   analyses of TCs' scripts and rationales can make visible a range of
   resources that TCs bring to the work of teaching-tools and practices,
   vision and dispositions of teaching, and understandings of students and
   content (Hammerness et al., 2005)-that inform how they respond to
   student contributions in whole-class discussions as a focal teaching
   practice. We illustrate a rich example and framework for analyzing TCs'
   responses to scripting tasks and offer implications for how such
   analyses can support teacher educators and researchers to make claims
   about TCs' learning and inform decisions about supports for TCs'
   development.},

Title = {Finding the boundary of kindergarteners' subtraction understanding:
   prospective teachers' problem development and questioning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-118},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A challenge for prospective teachers (PTs) is to determine what students
   know about a topic through asking appropriate questions and being
   thoughtful about the wording of these questions so as to capture and
   reframe students' spontaneous mathematical thinking and eventually
   unriddle the fuzzy boundary of students' complex thinking. This study
   examined four PTs' efforts to elicit kindergarteners' subtraction
   strategies and make conclusions about their subtraction understanding.
   Drawing on PTs' plans for interviewing kindergarteners on subtraction
   problems, interview transcripts, and reflection papers, the results
   suggest that PTs provided effective scaffolds, adding context to
   numerical problems or explaining mathematical terms and symbols as
   needed. However, they avoided asking problems with subtrahends greater
   than five, numbers above ten, and missing starts or missing subtrahends,
   limiting their ability to draw targeted conclusions about the students'
   strengths and needs. Using effective questions allowed one PT who posed
   a limited variety of problems to make stronger conclusions about her
   student's subtraction understanding, while asking a broader variety of
   problems helped another PT who used limited questions make conclusions
   about her student's subtraction understanding. Based on these results,
   mathematics teacher educators could leverage their PTs' strengths to
   either encourage multiple interviews, each targeting different problem
   types, or one interview with a broader variety of problem types. The
   results of this study further highlight the need for PTs to move beyond
   just asking students to explain their strategies and have them justify
   or represent their strategies as well.},

Title = {Didactic metadata informing teachers' selection of learning resources:
   boundary crossing in professional development},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {363-384},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {With the emergence of e-textbooks, along with expectations to integrate
   technology in instruction, teachers are becoming significant
   co-designers of the curriculum. Informed selection and sequencing of
   learning resources requires sensitivity to didactic nuance, and tools to
   support development and application of such sensitivity. Teachers'
   practices are constrained by the aspects of resources that are
   ``searchable,{''} which are limited using standard search engines, and
   the selection of tasks is influenced by the engines' ranking of search
   results, reflecting their popularity. We are developing and researching
   a coupled pair of tools to support mathematics teachers in making
   informed curricular decisions-a tool for tagging learning resources with
   prescribed categories of didactic metadata and a dashboard for browsing
   collections of resources according to this tagged metadata. In this
   article, we investigate affordances of these tools for the professional
   development of mathematics teachers-both practicing and pre-service
   teacher candidates. Viewing the dashboard, along with the metadata that
   it encodes, as a boundary object between the teachers' and the
   researchers' perspectives on curricular design, we show how teachers
   learned through acts of boundary crossing, conceived as transitions and
   interactions between the two communities' curricular discourses. We show
   how using the dashboard in a task-selection assignment encouraged
   teachers to reflect on their practice-making explicit the tacit
   considerations that they apply to curricular decisions and articulating
   them from the researchers' perspective. We also describe the emergence
   of ``hybrid{''} search strategies, integrating multiple perspectives to
   create practices that are both didactically informed and practically
   relevant for instruction.},

Abstract = {As teacher education shifts to focus on teaching beginners to do the
   work of teaching, assessments need to shift to focus on assessing
   practice. We focus on one teaching practice, eliciting student thinking,
   in the context of elementary mathematics. We describe assessments in two
   contexts (field and simulation). For each assessment, we describe the
   eliciting of three prospective teachers what could be seen about the
   skills of group of prospective teachers (N = 44). We report on how three
   prospective teachers had differing opportunities to demonstrate their
   skills in the context of the field assessment, but similar opportunities
   in the context of the simulation assessment. Although both contexts make
   important contributions, in each case, contributions are counterbalanced
   are by significant challenges. Although the authors do not argue for one
   assessment context over the other, they offer insights into the
   affordances and challenges of each so that teacher educators can make
   responsible decisions.},

Title = {On designing better structures for feedback in practice-based
   professional development: Using ``failure{''} to innovate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 29},
Abstract = {This research article contributes to the growing literature highlighting
   the potential for innovation in mathematics education through design
   cycles that involve creative risk-taking and failure-based learning.
   Specifically, we explore how ``failed{''} cycles of StoryCircles-a
   practice-based professional development approach that centers on teacher
   collaboration-have been productive in fostering innovations within the
   program. Our focus is on the challenges that arose in our efforts to
   enable feedback mechanisms within the StoryCircles system that support
   teachers' interrogation of their own instructional practice, as they
   collaboratively develop lessons and expand their collective knowledge
   base for teaching mathematics. Through examples of three challenges, we
   illustrate how various lesson artifacts, including those constructed by
   teachers in anticipation of implementation and those extracted from
   actual implementations, failed to serve as the sole source of feedback
   for supporting teachers' growth.},

Title = {Secondary mathematics preservice teachers' perceptions of program
   (in)coherence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 6},
Abstract = {Teacher educators globally have argued that developing coherent programs
   can combat the fragmentation that often characterizes teacher education
   and better support teacher learning. Yet, there is little research on
   coherence in mathematics teacher education, especially from the
   perspectives of preservice teachers. To that end, in this article, we
   report how 13 secondary mathematics preservice teachers (PSTs) from one
   teacher education program perceived their program as coherent,
   specifically attending to the ideas and practices PSTs engaged with and
   the settings in which they engaged with those ideas/practices. Based on
   participatory diagramming interviews and network analysis, we found that
   PSTs experienced two main sources of incoherence. First, although PSTs
   had opportunities to learn about equity from multiple settings, they did
   not perceive that equity and other aspects of mathematics instruction
   together were coherently organized. Second, PSTs reported learning about
   two opposing instructional approaches-direct instruction and
   inquiry-based instruction. PSTs reported that opportunities to learn
   about inquiry-based instruction were primarily isolated to courses
   taught by the mathematics education program and were contradicted by
   learning and experiencing direct instruction in their special education
   courses, mathematics courses, and field and student teaching
   experiences. Findings highlight a need to attend to issues of equity, as
   well as connections among university coursework and between coursework
   and field. Based on our findings, we conclude with implications for how
   teacher education programs might respond to and engage with incoherence

Abstract = {This study focuses on a lesson study adaptation for bridging prospective
   teachers' experiences in a methods course and their field experiences in
   a teacher education program in Puerto Rico. We ask, what opportunities
   for teacher learning emerge during discussions in lesson study? Two
   lesson study teams of secondary mathematics prospective teachers, each
   led by an experienced mentor, planned technology-based lessons. Using
   the theoretical framework for lesson study by Lewis and colleagues, we
   analyzed video recordings of the teams' discussions. The results show
   learning opportunities in the three dimensions of the framework:
   teachers' knowledge and beliefs, the creation of a professional
   community, and the development of teaching-learning artifacts. The
   mentors leveraged prospective teachers' knowledge, built on topics
   discussed in the methods course, and created a professional learning
   community. Three resources introduced in the methods course supported
   the creation of a hybrid space connecting academic and practitioner
   knowledge: shared language about teaching moves for using technology in
   math instruction, the mathematical proficiency framework, and a lesson
   plan template. The mentors drew upon their subject matter and
   pedagogical knowledge during their facilitation of lesson study. The
   intervention exemplifies a lesson study adaptation that is feasible in
   the context of a teacher education program.},

   special educators require a deep understanding of a diverse array of
   student thinking. Unfortunately, historic and contemporary data suggest
   that opportunities for special educators to develop this knowledge prior
   to classroom teaching are diminutive. Further inquiry is needed into
   pre-service experiences that might support growth in teachers'
   knowledge. We present results from a US-based semester-long course
   grounded in neurodiversity and students' mathematical thinking designed
   to improve 20 special educators' pedagogical content knowledge.
   Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to determine how
   the pre-service teachers anticipated students' diverse mathematical
   thinking before and after experience in the course along with their
   propensity to adapt problems to respond to diversity during instruction.
   Furthermore, the pre-test to post-test changes in pre-service teachers'
   anticipations of students' problem-solving strategies and adaptations of
   problems were statistically significant. Implications for teacher
   preparation and future research are shared.},

Abstract = {There is compelling evidence on the effectiveness of bibliotherapy for
   facilitating one's development. Arguably, in teacher education,
   bibliotherapy has been shown to facilitate prospective teachers'
   professional development. However, teacher educators may experience
   difficulties in finding relevant reading to stimulate prospective
   teachers' identification process, which is essential if the application
   of pedagogical bibliotherapy is to be successful. This study is situated
   in a mathematics education course for prospective elementary school
   teachers and explores the features of relevant pedagogical reading via
   analysis of four prospective elementary school teachers' identification
   processes with two case descriptions. The identification here relates to
   the reading of the so-called true stories; prospective teachers read
   stories of other prospective teachers from the same teacher education
   context. We outline the recommendations for the selection of reading
   material when applying pedagogical bibliotherapy in order to assist
   prospective teachers' professional development.},

Abstract = {The knowledge that mathematics teacher educators need has attracted
   limited but increasing attention in recent years. The papers in this
   special issue build on emerging themes from that work and raise
   additional questions that contribute towards a future research agenda in
   the field. Several of the articles develop conceptualisations of teacher
   knowledge to apply to mathematics teacher educators, introducing new
   aspects and drawing attention to unique characteristics of mathematics
   teacher educators in the process. To some extent the questions these
   papers raise reflect similar questions in mathematics education more
   generally but for which the implications for mathematics teacher
   educators warrant attention. In this paper we review the articles in
   this special issue and use them as a springboard to examine contemporary
   developments in the field and posit ways forward for research on
   mathematics teacher educators' knowledge.},

Title = {Comparing how college mathematics instructors and high-school teachers
   recognize professional obligations of mathematics teaching when making
   instructional decisions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 30},
Abstract = {This paper investigates how mathematics instructors' recognition of the
   professional obligations of mathematics teaching varies based on their
   institutional environment, specifically whether they teach high school
   or college mathematics. Using an instrument that measures instructors'
   recognition of four hypothesized professional obligations, we surveyed
   471 US high school mathematics teachers and 239 university mathematics
   instructors to measure the extent to which they recognized professional
   obligations when evaluating the appropriateness of certain instructional
   actions. After testing measurement invariance of four item sets, each of
   which measures one of the four hypothesized professional
   obligations-disciplinary, institutional, interpersonal, and individual
   obligations-, we compared the instructors' recognition of each of the
   four obligations between the two groups. We found that university
   instructors recognized the institutional obligation more than high
   school teachers, while recognizing the individual and interpersonal
   obligations significantly less. This investigation provides insight into
   the variation in the nature of mathematics teaching practice across
   different levels of schooling.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 12},
Abstract = {The use of digital technology has the potential to support students'
   understanding in the mathematics classroom with the teacher playing a
   vital role. However, teaching with digital technology is not trivial,
   especially for teachers who are new to this. In this paper, we present
   an analysis of the enactment of a function lesson of a Sri Lankan
   mathematics teacher who used digital technology for the first time in
   her teaching. We combined the instrumental orchestration and ROG
   (resources, orientations and goals) frameworks into a conceptual
   framework to analyse her teaching. In particular, we used instrumental
   orchestration to identify how the teacher orchestrated the resources in
   her technology-rich classroom. This was combined with ROG theory to
   understand the reasons underpinning the decisions involved in moving
   from one orchestration to another. We demonstrate that this teacher
   showed diverse orchestrations and use the ROG framework to present these
   in the sequences in which they were used, formed into chains of
   orchestrations linked by goals. We propose that her didactical
   performance is a function of orchestration types over in-the-moment
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {A 12-episode constructivist teaching experiment with two pairs of
   elementary preservice teachers was conducted to examine how they reason
   distributively and proportionally. Specifically, I studied how
   prospective teachers reason with ratios as multiplicative comparisons.
   Prospective teachers solved different problems in one specific context
   (Step Problems) that require to reason with ratios as multiplicative
   comparisons, and represented their pictures during the episodes and the
   follow-up interviews. Second-order models of four prospective teachers
   were made. In this study I found that reasoning with ratios as
   multiplicative comparisons in that specific context of problems was
   challenging for prospective teachers and all four had considerable
   difficulty. Only one of the four prospective teachers fully reasoned
   with ratios as multiplicative comparisons. The findings of this study
   provide teacher educators with a new perspective on prospective
   teachers' quantitative understanding of proportional reasoning, a domain
   as we know little about, and has implications for the mathematical
   preparation of prospective elementary teachers.},

Abstract = {This study examines technology-enhanced teacher responses and students'
   written mathematical explanations to understand how to support effective
   teacher responding and the centering of students' mathematical ideas.
   Although prior research has focused on teacher noticing and responding
   to students' mathematical ideas, few studies have explored the revisions
   that students make to their written explanations after teacher
   responding and very few explore this in authentic classroom contexts.
   Four high school geometry teachers and thirty of their students
   participated in project-based tasks examining the relationships between
   scale factor and the dimensions, surface area, and volume of a
   rectangular prism. The teachers' written feedback and the students'
   written explanations were coded and scored. Results show that student
   explanations improved significantly after students received feedback
   about their mathematical ideas. Furthermore, results indicate that the
   teacher feedback may be more effective if it focuses on mathematical
   relationships between variables and that additional feedback about the
   variables alone may have little impact. Results contribute to an
   understanding of how eliciting students' written mathematical
   explanations might support effective teacher responding in classroom
   contexts.},

Title = {Teacher expertise for fostering at-risk students' understanding of basic
   concepts: conceptual model and evidence for growth},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Various intervention programs for fostering at-risk students'
   understanding of basic concepts (such as place value understanding or
   meanings of multiplication and division) have been developed and
   evaluated. However, little is known about the teacher expertise required
   to enact these intervention programs, and how this teacher expertise can
   be promoted. The article suggests a conceptual model for teacher
   expertise for fostering at-risk students' understanding based on three
   recurrent jobs: (a) specify learning content (in basic concepts), (b)
   monitor students' learning progress (in basic concepts) and (3) enhance
   students' understanding (of basic concepts). Mastering these jobs with
   productive teaching practices involves four orientations in particular
   (conceptual rather than procedural orientation, diagnostic rather than
   syllabus-led orientation, communicative rather than individualistic
   orientation, and long-term rather than short-term orientation) as well
   as detailed pedagogical content categories for unpacking relevant
   knowledge elements. The paper reports on the professional development
   program Mastering Math which aims at promoting this expertise and its
   evaluation using a pre-post-design. For 95 participating teachers, the
   practices for specifying goals and monitoring and enhancing at-risk
   students' understanding were captured in self-reports and situated in
   vignette-based activities for eliciting diagnostic judgments. Teachers'
   development across different aspects of their expertise from the
   beginning and the end of the 1-year PD reveals the first quantitative
   evidence that the PD was effective in promoting growth of expertise.
   Whereas specifying and monitoring practices had substantially developed,
   the enhancement practices were hindered by a persistent short-term
   orientation.},

Abstract = {To better understand the critical early years of teaching and teacher
   identity development, this study explored the mathematics teacher
   identity of two early career middle school mathematics teachers and the
   influence of their working communities on its development. Emel and Berk
   graduated from the same reform-oriented teacher education program and
   were working in fundamentally different working communities that could
   be characterized as reform-unsupportive (Emel) and reform-supportive
   (Berk). They were interviewed three times and were observed extensively
   in their working communities. Findings revealed two different teacher
   identities: Emel exhibited a mathematics teacher identity that was more
   reform-oriented than non-reform-oriented, and Berk exhibited a
   non-reform-oriented mathematics teacher identity. Their working
   communities had influenced their mathematics teacher identity in ways
   that were both theoretically expected (positive effects of supportive
   conditions and negative effects of unsupportive conditions) and
   surprising (positive effects of negative conditions and no effects of
   positive conditions). The findings are discussed in detail with
   implications for teacher education programs and supports for early
   career teachers.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the nature of prospective teachers' noticing of
   students' understanding as they analyze and discuss middle school
   students' understandings of trapezoids in micro-case videos in the
   context of geometry. In this exploratory study, the data were obtained
   from eight prospective middle school mathematics teachers through
   individual video analysis, reflection papers, and group discussions. The
   results indicated that the use of purposeful micro-case video designs
   based on prospective teachers' background knowledge of quadrilaterals
   allowed them to be productive in video analyses and discussions. In
   individual video analyses, prospective teachers attended to various
   mathematical elements to identify students' responses but did not always
   use them to make interpretations of each student's understanding of
   trapezoid. In the group discussions of the micro-case videos, in
   contrast, prospective teachers could provide alternative interpretations
   of students' understanding by identifying links between the mathematical
   elements in students' responses and the characteristics of students'
   understandings. In the group discussions, they provided more detailed
   and specific instructional actions to support each student's
   understanding of trapezoid than their individual video analyses. This
   study suggests practical implications for teacher education programs on
   how to use video cases (e.g., firstly, working individually and then
   having group discussions about the videos) to explore prospective
   teachers' professional noticing skills. Considering prospective
   teachers' background knowledge of related mathematical contents, this
   study can also inspire future studies on how to design effective videos
   about students' mathematical understanding.},

Abstract = {Proportional reasoning is foundational in school mathematics. Despite
   the importance of proportional reasoning, little has been written about
   the knowledge needed for teachers to teach proportional reasoning
   relative to its importance. In this paper, we present an initial
   definition for a robust understanding of proportional reasoning for
   teaching based on synthesizing past scholarship in conjunction with an
   empirical study of the knowledge resources practicing teachers use to
   make sense of proportional reasoning tasks. As a result of this effort,
   we present here an initial framing of operationalized knowledge
   resources based upon our definition for a robust understanding that
   could be used as an analytic tool. We also describe how such a framework
   of knowledge resources is useful in the context of teacher education,
   and we provide an example of how the framework was used to analyze the
   knowledge resources a teacher employed to make sense of a proportional
   reasoning task. We end by discussing possible implications our framework
   has for designing teacher education experiences and further research
   that is needed.},

Abstract = {This article characterizes my use of video as a tool for research,
   design and development. I argue that videos, while a potentially
   overwhelming source of data, provide the kind of large bandwidth that
   enables one to capture phenomena that one might otherwise miss; and that
   although the act of taping is in itself an act of selection, there is
   typically enough shown in a video that it rewards multiple watching and
   supports the kinds of arguments over data that are essential for theory
   testing and replication. In pragmatic terms, video presents phenomena in
   ways that have an immediacy that is tremendously valuable. I discuss
   ways in which videos help students and teachers focus on phenomena that
   might otherwise be very hard to grapple with. This article begins with a
   brief review of my uses of video, almost 40 years ago, for research and
   development in problem solving. It then moves to the discussion of very
   fine-grained research on learning and decision making. The bulk of the
   article is devoted to a discussion of the teaching for robust
   understanding (TRU) framework, which was derived in large measure from
   the extensive review of classroom videotapes, and which serves as the
   basis for an extensive program of pre-service and in-service
   professional development. The professional development relies heavily on
   the use of videos to convey the key ideas in TRU, and to help teachers
   plan and review instruction.},

Title = {Documenting two emerging sociomathematical norms for examining functions
   in mathematics teachers' online asynchronous discussions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 22},
Abstract = {This study investigated novice mathematics teachers participating in an
   online teacher education course focused on covariational reasoning and
   understanding the behavior of functions. The analysis centered on
   documenting the emergence of participants' sociomathematical norms for
   engaging in online asynchronous discussions. In this paper, we
   characterized participants' initial mathematical discourse and
   documented two emergent sociomathematical norms, namely explaining why
   and emergent shape discourse. When participants explained why, they used
   specific quantities or symbolic representations of functions to justify
   why function graphs have particular visual features. When participants
   engaged in emergent shape discourse, they coordinated change between
   covarying quantities to justify why function graphs behave in certain
   ways. This study provides evidence that online settings can provide
   context for mathematics teachers engaging in legitimate collaborative
   mathematical activity and that activity can be enhanced by participation
   in discourse featuring specific sociomathematical norms. We discuss
   conjectures regarding the potential of reflective discussion activities
   paired with the Notice and Wonder Framework to support the emergence of
   generative sociomathematical norms. We also discuss potential
   relationships between characteristics of participants' mathematical
   discourse and their membership with the core and periphery of a social
   network.},

Abstract = {Teachers' noticing of students' mathematical thinking plays an important
   role in supporting student learning. Yet little is known about how
   online professional development (PD)-a growing setting for PD in the
   USA-can cultivate this noticing. Here, we explore the potential of using
   two online tools for engaging video to support K-2 teachers' noticing of
   students' mathematical thinking in the context of a six-week online
   video-based PD program. While participating in the program, teachers
   used a commenting tool that allowed them to view video in its entirety
   and write a summary note, as well as a tagging tool that allowed them to
   mark moments of video while viewing and associate notes with those
   moments. We found that teachers' regular use of the tagging tool
   promoted their increased noticing of students' mathematical thinking in
   video. Further, the tagging tool and commenting tool appeared to
   function in complementary ways to support teachers' noticing. These
   findings contribute to the field's growing understanding of how
   technological advances can support the development and study of
   mathematics teacher noticing, with implications for the design of online
   teacher learning environments.},

Abstract = {Given that early career elementary teachers face pressure to plan
   pedagogy that provides equitable opportunities to learn mathematics for
   understanding, it is important to consider their mathematics lesson
   planning practices. This study uses interview data to compare the
   planning practices of four early career teachers (ECTs) who consistently
   rated highly on an observational measure of high-quality mathematics
   instruction with those of three ECTs who consistently rated lower. ECTs
   who scored highly addressed planning challenges in interconnected ways
   that were responsive to students' needs, demonstrated more agency in
   representing mathematics content in their planning, and were more likely
   to maintain curricular rigor when differentiating. We consider
   implications for efforts to help ECTs plan lessons that are likely to
   result in high-quality instruction.},

Title = {One university's story on teacher preparation in elementary mathematics:
   examining opportunities to learn},

Abstract = {This multi-case study examines how three elementary mathematics methods
   instructors, in the same teacher education program, provide their
   prospective teachers with learning opportunities. Qualitative data were
   collected through interviews, classroom observations, and artifacts. The
   findings suggest that the instructors' beliefs associated with teaching
   philosophies influence both the content that prospective teachers have
   the opportunity to learn (what) and the nature of the prospective
   teachers' opportunities to learn (how). Through analytic induction,
   three assertions were developed to understand and explicate:
   similarities in opportunities to learn, differences in opportunities to
   learn, and perceptions about the purpose of the methods courses across
   the three cases. Specifically, the first assertion examines how all
   three methods instructors focused on developing conceptual understanding
   and combating mathematical misconceptions for which prospective teachers
   most often experience opportunities to learn through representations and
   approximations. The second and third assertions place more emphasis on
   differences across the cases based upon observed instructor actions and
   their beliefs. This study is significant because it helps us gain a
   deeper understanding about prospective teachers' opportunities to learn
   within one teacher education program, and therefore, may point toward
   what can be done in the future to better prepare teachers in elementary
   mathematics education and the development of ambitious instruction.
   Additionally, this study unpacks how prospective teachers in the same
   teacher education program may have varying experiences and thus varied
   access to opportunities to learn.},

Title = {Teacher time outs in rehearsals: in-service teachers learning ambitious

Abstract = {The article focuses on rehearsals as part of a practice-based approach
   to professional development. Fourteen Norwegian elementary in-service
   teachers (ISTs) collaborate in learning cycles of enactment and
   investigation, where the overarching aim is to learn to enact the
   practices that constitute ambitious mathematics teaching. Rehearsals are
   an important part of these cycles. We examine the patterns of use of
   teacher time outs (TTOs) in rehearsals and how TTOs enable the ISTs to
   learn core practices of ambitious teaching. The findings reveal that
   approximately 60\% of the time in rehearsals is spent on ISTs' teaching
   and 40\% on TTOs. The TTOs enable the ISTs to learn together the
   practices of using representations, aiming towards goals, launching
   problems, organising the board and facilitating student talk. The
   findings reveal that the participants were able to work simultaneously
   on multiple practices, and a recurrent theme in the TTOs is representing
   students' ideas as accurately as possible whilst simultaneously
   considering the mathematical correctness of the representations.},

Title = {The case of Mrs. Purl: Using a learning trajectory as a tool for
   teaching},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-125},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Researchers have hypothesized and, in some cases, shown that
   hypothetical learning trajectories (LT)s can be effective tools in
   teaching, but implementation, across individual teachers, varies. From
   the literature base, we have identified six ways researchers have
   hypothesized teachers might be able to use LTs in their work as
   teachers: formatively assess students over time, attend to student
   thinking, provide appropriate differentiation, design and modify
   mathematical tasks, choose appropriate learning goals, and relate lesson
   goals to broader curriculum goals. To gain greater insight from the
   teachers' perspective, we followed one teacher, Mrs. Purl, and
   chronicled her efforts in using the LT to design and enact student
   interviews and lessons. During data collection, Mrs. Purl participated
   in in-the-moment noticing in which she noted events during interviews or
   instruction that she found significant. Following interviews and
   lessons, Mrs. Purl was asked to reflect on each of the events and
   describe what she noticed, what she could infer about student
   understanding, and instructional implications. Using literature on
   teacher noticing, we qualitatively analyzed each of the three components
   and then related them back to the ways in which researchers have
   hypothesized teachers might be able to use learning trajectories.
   Findings suggest that the LT supported Mrs. Purl in attending to
   students' thinking, designing and modifying mathematical tasks, and
   choosing appropriate learning goals, but she did not refer to the LT to
   provide differentiation, formatively assess students over time, or
   relate lesson goals to broader curriculum goals.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the potential of participatory action research to
   bring about significant changes in practice in a context in which more
   conventional approaches to research have had limited impact. It focuses
   on secondary mathematics classrooms where teaching approaches
   characterised by memorising and practising mathematical procedures, with
   little understanding of their application, purpose or underlying
   concepts, remain commonplace in many countries around the world and have
   proved highly resistant to change. The paper highlights the damage
   caused by such practices in terms of the alienation of large numbers of
   students and the inequitable outcomes they are associated with,
   including the strong correlation that persists between students'
   socio-economic status and mathematical attainment. It reports on the
   case of one participatory action research project, involving the author
   and five teacher researchers, that demonstrated how a vision of
   mathematics education, involving a genuinely engaging and empowering
   curriculum, can be translated into classroom practice. The paper
   considers the extent to which this research project was conducted in a
   collaborative, systematic and rigorous way. It reflects on the research
   processes that facilitated critical reflection, enabled the teacher
   researchers to overcome constraints and generated trustworthy findings.
   The insights gained from this analysis are used to argue that a
   participatory action research methodology, which resonates with a
   critical mathematics pedagogy, has the potential to challenge prevailing
   discourses in mathematics education and hence lead to genuine
   transformations in classroom practice.},

Title = {Prospective elementary teachers' responses to unanticipated incorrect

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Eliciting and responding to student thinking are high-leverage practices
   that have powerful implications for student learning. However, they are
   difficult to enact effectively, particularly for novices, and more
   research is needed to understand how teacher education can support
   teachers in developing these skills. This study examined ways
   prospective elementary teachers (PSTs) responded to unanticipated
   incorrect student solutions to high-demand problem-solving tasks and how
   their responses changed over a 6-week field experience embedded in a
   practiced-based mathematics methods course. Data were collected in 6
   weekly cycles of planning (written plans), enactment (video of
   problem-solving sessions with students), and reflection (written
   reflections on video). Problem-solving task implementations were
   analyzed using cognitive demand and math-talk frameworks. Of the three
   collaborating PST groups, two groups improved at responding to
   unanticipated incorrect solutions, but these two groups also developed a
   tendency to shut down anticipated solutions. The third group showed no
   patterns in their responses to unanticipated incorrect solutions, but
   did maintain the cognitive demand when responding to anticipated
   solutions. I present a case of one group of collaborating PSTs who made
   improvements in responding to unanticipated incorrect solutions in terms
   of the pedagogical moves they employed, cognitive demand associated with
   their responses, and how their responses changed over time. Implications
   for teacher education are discussed.},

Title = {Fostering pre-service teachers' attention to mathematical objects: The
   realization tree mediator as a teaching representation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 26},
Abstract = {Using teaching representations is one of the common means for preparing
   pre-service mathematics teachers (PSTs) to learn how to teach
   mathematics meaningfully. However, turning PSTs' attention to the
   mathematical objects that students engage with during the lesson is a
   challenging pursuit. This paper suggests using the Realization Tree
   Mediator (RTM) as a visual teaching representation for PST learning to
   implement cognitively demanding tasks in their classrooms. The RTM
   depicts the mathematical object at the core of a task and its different
   realizations while illustrating imaginary classroom discussions in which
   different realizations and the links between them are produced. By
   analyzing PSTs' conversations around RTM images, we show how contrasting
   pairs of RTMs can be used for eliciting conversations about various
   aspects of cognitively demanding instruction. We discuss the affordances
   of the RTM as a teaching representation and how it can assist in making
   the mathematical content and meanings visible, public, and communicable
   among teachers and teacher educators.},

Title = {Constructing coherency levels to understand connections among the
   noticing skills of pre-service mathematics teachers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 29},
Abstract = {This study aims to analyze possible connections among the noticing
   skills of pre-service mathematics teachers, and specifically the skills
   of attending to students' thinking, interpreting students' mathematical
   understanding, and proposing teaching alternatives. We characterized
   these connections in terms of coherency, i.e., the extent to which
   pre-service teachers take into account (a) an identified critical
   event-including its mathematics and context-when interpreting students'
   statements, (b) their own interpretation of students' statements when
   interpreting the teacher's response, and (c) their own interpretation of
   students' statements when proposing alternative teaching strategies. The
   construct of coherency evolved during our attempts to analyze
   pre-service teachers' interpretations of the critical events they
   identified while observing mathematics lessons as part of their
   preparation program. In this paper, we elucidate the construct of
   coherency and its different levels and demonstrate how this construct
   relies upon and expands existing ideas from the literature on noticing.
   We propose a framework for identifying different coherency levels and
   the different patterns identified when using the framework to noticing
   among the pre-service teachers. Some of these patterns are supported by
   previous research, while others were unanticipated. We explore possible
   explanations for the emergence of these unanticipated patterns.},

Title = {Preservice elementary teachers' mathematical achievement and attitudes:
   A study of blended learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 2},
Abstract = {The primary purpose of this quasi-experimental mixed-methods study was
   to examine whether a blended learning approach was more effective than
   traditional face-to-face instruction in improving the mathematical
   achievement and attitudes of preservice elementary teachers. The
   secondary purpose was to determine what specific features of blended
   learning were deemed most helpful to prospective teachers' learning of
   mathematics. Sixty-three prospective teachers participated in a
   foundational mathematics course in either a face-to-face (F2F)
   traditional or blended learning format. At pre- and post-test,
   participants completed a researcher-developed mathematics achievement
   test and the Dutton's Attitude Scale (Dutton in ESJ 68:259-264, 1968) .
   Blended learning participants also completed a post-course
   researcher-developed questionnaire on their perceptions of blended
   learning. Results indicated that participants who were enrolled in the
   blended learning format had significantly better attitudes at post-test
   than teachers in the F2F format, but no condition differences were found
   for mathematical achievement. Participants in the blended learning
   condition valued the flexibility of course structure and control over
   instructional pace but expressed that time management and decreased
   physical presence of the instructor were challenges. These findings
   suggest important elements to consider when designing blended learning
   courses.},

Abstract = {In this study, hypothetical samples of students' work on a task

   characteristics of the ways in which 154 elementary prospective teachers
   (PSTs) paid attention to students' work in mathematics. The analysis
   included what the PSTs attended to, their interpretations, and their
   suggestions for supporting students' further learning. While the
   findings showed that the PSTs noticed a wide range of aspects of
   mathematical learning, their analyses of students' thinking and their
   ideas for supporting students' learning lacked sophistication. Also,
   there was considerable divergence between the students' thinking as
   evidenced in the hypothetical problem solutions and the PSTs' suggested
   support. Based on these findings, we provide some suggestions for
   teacher education.},

Abstract = {Mathematics teaching in a 21st-century educational context requires a
   shift to active learning. The shift calls on teachers, and the plans
   countries need to prepare to make the changes through well-designed
   teacher professional development programs. ARPA (Spanish acronym for
   Activating Problem Solving in Classrooms), as a professional development
   program, with an emphasis on collaborative problem solving, provides
   opportunities and tools for teachers to enrich their classroom
   activities in a student-centered manner. This study of 149 in-service
   teachers evaluates the impact of an ARPA workshop on teachers'
   self-efficacy and their tendency to choose student-centered practices.
   The results show that before participating in the program, even if
   teachers had believed in their ability to solve problems, they did not
   consider how to connect this ability with the active student-centered
   problem-solving practices in their classroom. However, teachers'
   self-efficacy in performing problem solving significantly affects the
   teachers' report of their student-centered practices after participating
   in the program. Understanding the relationship between teacher

Abstract = {Facilitators of professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers
   currently gain increasing attention, as their practices are crucial for
   the success of spreading mathematics educational ideas and innovations
   into schools and strengthening the professional expertise of teachers.
   So far, mainly two components of facilitation have been empirically
   researched: facilitators' knowledge resources and facilitation moves. In
   this paper, we propose to develop a more comprehensive conceptual
   framework in order to explain facilitators' practices and underlying
   decisions. For this purpose, we lift Schoenfeld's ROG framework for
   teachers' decision-making (comprising resources, orientations, and
   goals) to the facilitator level, and add identity as a fourth component
   to obtain what we call the ROGI framework. We draw on data collected
   simultaneously in two PD projects for mathematics teachers in Germany
   and in Israel. Through three cases of facilitation, we illustrate how
   the adapted ROGI framework helps to understand processes of
   decision-making made by facilitators during mathematics professional
   development sessions.},

Title = {Modelling lessons for more than imitation: investigating teachers'

Abstract = {The literature highlights differing views on the efficacy of modelling
   lessons for teacher professional learning. In this study we draw on
   dissonance theory to discuss lesson modelling that seeks to transcend
   `do as I do' imitation and provoke teachers' attention to intended
   teaching practices: a necessary pre-cursor for changes to practice. A
   collective case study investigated the experiences and perceptions of 18
   practising primary teachers from four school contexts participating in
   the process of: collectively observing modelling of mathematics lessons
   in their classrooms, analysing different parts of those practices with
   the modeller, and enacting them. It was found that modelling lessons
   associated with inquiry-oriented approaches for developing students'
   problem-solving and reasoning in teachers' own classrooms appeared to
   confront their assumptions about traditional approaches to teaching and
   learning mathematics. The teachers' surprise at their students'
   engagement in the challenging learning experiences conflicted with their
   existing views of teaching and impelled them to reflect on and set goals
   for improving their practice. Suggestions for pre- and post-lesson
   protocols for stimulating productive discussions are proposed, along
   with implications for designing school-based professional learning
   processes using lesson modelling.},

Abstract = {This paper reports about professional learning related to mathematics
   instruction in student-teaching triads. The study focuses on how the
   joint work of triads offers opportunities for the professional learning
   of student teachers (interns), mentor teachers, and supervisors. Two
   elementary student-teaching triads reported different areas of and
   opportunities for professional learning related to mathematics
   instruction, with more areas and richer opportunities reported by the
   triad with more extensive collaboration among its members. Findings
   suggest the need for professional development activities in which
   mentors and supervisors can examine their stances toward joint work and
   professional learning in triads.},

Abstract = {Among mathematics teacher educators, a consensus has emerged that
   exemplary teaching involves attention to students' thinking. This
   consensus stems, in part, from theoretical and empirical work
   highlighting the importance of teachers' being able to make thoughtful
   in-the-moment decisions, building on students' ideas to adjust the
   ongoing lesson. Since this in-the-moment flexibility draws in large part
   on teachers' noticing capabilities, mathematics education researchers
   have paid increasing attention over the past decade to key
   characteristics of teacher noticing and to ways to help teachers develop
   these skills and inclinations. In this paper, we explore how engaging
   teachers in annotating videos of mathematics classrooms can provide
   important insights into teacher noticing of students' mathematical
   thinking. We argue that, when used in particular ways, video tagging
   affords researchers and teacher educators the ability to examine the
   relationship between what grabs a teacher's attention and how teachers
   interpret the thinking displayed in those moments, and instructionally
   actionable feedback about how teachers are progressing in their
   attending to and interpreting of students' thinking, two related skills
   that may or may not develop in sync.},

Abstract = {Increased accountability demands are being placed on teacher preparation
   programs across the USA to demonstrate competencies of their teacher
   candidates. As a means of evaluating teacher candidates' instructional
   effectiveness and readiness for their own classrooms, some programs are
   using standardized teacher performance assessments, with faculty
   navigating how to respond to these requirements while maintaining a
   focus on desired learning outcomes of methods courses. This study's
   elementary teacher preparation program is located in one of the states
   recently requiring successful completion of the Elementary Education
   edTPA, which includes four tasks with one focused on mathematics (i.e.,
   Math Task 4). A case study design was used to explore the preparation of
   teacher candidates (N = 51) for edTPA during a mathematics methods
   course emphasizing Cognitively Guided Instruction that included a
   simulated Math Task 4 assignment. The study specifically investigated
   changes in mathematical beliefs across the course and perspectives on
   engagement in the simulated Math Task 4. Data were collected via two
   belief surveys: an open-ended questionnaire and individual interviews of
   six participants. The quantitative findings show two important course
   intentions-that pedagogical beliefs would shift toward more cognitive
   alignment and teaching efficacy beliefs would increase-were not
   realized. The qualitative data provide insights into some of the
   struggles associated with edTPA, including pronounced anxiety and
   substantial misalignment with classroom placements, serving as a filter
   for learning and change during the course.},

Abstract = {Interactions around unexpected, incorrect, or dis-preferred responses
   can be powerful sites of learning for both teachers and students. The
   information that teachers uncover through probing student thinking can
   then guide their pedagogical response. We report on a study of
   prospective teachers' skills and capabilities around a particular
   problem of practice: eliciting student thinking when a student has an
   incorrect answer. In this case, if the student's thinking is
   sufficiently probed, the student is able to recognize the mistake and
   revise their work. Focusing on prospective teachers at the beginning of
   a teacher preparation program, we illustrate how knowledge of this kind
   of eliciting skill can be gathered through the use of a live teaching
   simulation. Our findings reveal that these prospective teachers were
   more fluent with eliciting the student's process than the student's
   conceptual understanding. Further, they focused more on eliciting the
   revised method and/or solution than asking about why the mistake was
   made. We consider the findings in terms of the skills brought by
   prospective teachers that could be built upon in teacher education,
   skills that need to be learned, and skills that need to be unlearned.},

Abstract = {Many in the field of mathematics education call for elementary schools
   to have elementary mathematics specialists (EMSs) who provide needed
   mathematical expertise and support for children and teachers. EMSs serve
   as a reasonable, immediate alternative to the challenges generated by
   elementary teachers needing improved mathematical knowledge for teaching
   in the classroom. However, limited inquiry has explored how to best
   prepare EMSs and how program features and learning activities influence
   their development. This mixed-method study identifies some of the
   interrelated benefits from a K-5 Mathematics Endorsement Program
   designed to prepare EMSs through examining changes in mathematical
   beliefs, specialized content knowledge (SCK), and classroom teaching
   practices during the program. Data (n = 32) were collected over the
   2-semester program via belief surveys, a content knowledge assessment,
   observations of teaching practices, and individual interviews from
   elementary teachers participating in the program. The findings show some
   changes in beliefs can be made relatively quickly, other shifts in
   beliefs take more time and continued support, and changes in SCK and
   adoption of various aspects of standard-based pedagogy require
   considerably greater opportunities to learn. The described program
   features and learning experiences provided a context for these changes
   and offer considerations for EMS preparation programs.},

Abstract = {Modeling is a major topic of interest in mathematics education. However,
   the field's definition of models is diverse. Less is known about what
   teachers identify as mathematical models, even though it is teachers who
   ultimately enact modeling activities in the classroom. In this study, we
   asked nine middle school teachers with a variety of academic backgrounds
   and teaching experience to collect data related to one familiar physical
   phenomenon, cooling liquid. We then asked each participant to construct
   a model of that phenomenon, describe why it was a model, and identify
   whether a variety of artifacts representing the phenomenon also counted
   as models during a semi-structured interview. We sought to identify:
   what do mathematics teachers attend to when describing what constitutes
   a model? And, how do their attentions shift as they engage in different
   activities related to models? Using content analysis, we documented what
   features and purposes teachers attended to when describing a
   mathematical model. When constructing their own model, they focused on
   the visual form of the model and what quantitative information it should
   include. When deciding whether particular representational artifacts
   constituted models, they focused on how the representations reflected
   the system under study, and what purposes those representations could
   serve in further understanding that system. These findings suggest
   teachers may have multiple understandings of models, which are active at
   different times and reflect different perspectives. This has
   implications for research, teacher education, and professional
   development.},

Abstract = {Lesson study is highly regarded as a model for professional learning,
   yet remains under-theorised. This article examines the professional
   learning experiences of teachers and numeracy coaches from three schools
   in a local network of schools, participating in a lesson study project
   over two research cycles in 2012. It maps the interconnections between
   their experiences and their beliefs and practices, using Clarke and
   Hollingsworth's (Teach Educ 18(8):947-967, 2002) Interconnected Model of
   Professional Growth. Analysis of interview data and video-recordings of
   planning meetings, research lessons, and post-lesson discussions reveals
   the development of teachers' collaborative planning skills, increased
   attention to students' mathematical thinking, use of orchestrated
   whole-class discussion based on anticipated student solutions and
   focused questioning, and the enhancement of collaborative practices for
   teacher inquiry. Our findings illuminate the interplay between the

Title = {From mistakes, we learn? Mathematics teachers' epistemological and
   positional framing of mistakes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-136},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This interpretive cross-case study investigates complexity in the ways
   teachers frame mistakes and the reasons behind their framing,
   challenging the assumption in the literature that productive beliefs
   about errors generate productive error-handling practices, while
   unproductive beliefs result in unproductive practices. The study draws
   on interviews and classroom observations with three secondary
   mathematics teachers who were selected using purposive sampling.
   Analysis examines how the teachers framed mistakes in their classroom
   practice and the instructional moves that enacted each frame. We paid
   particular attention to epistemological frames, which concern the value
   of mistakes in the construction of mathematical knowledge, and
   positional frames, which concern the roles that students are authorized
   or obligated to take to address errors, researching how teachers'
   epistemological and positional framing of errors were related. The
   results suggest that teachers invoked four primary frames related to
   errors: a epistemological frame of errors-as-resources, a positional
   frame of students-as-capable, an epistemological frame of
   errors-as-deficiencies, and an positional frame of
   students-as-incapable. We discuss barriers to using mistakes as
   resources for learning and implications for mathematics teacher
   education.},

Abstract = {This study focused on the practice of selecting student strategies for
   whole-class discussions with teachers working toward a vision of
   instruction that is responsive to students' mathematical thinking.
   Selecting strategies is one of the 5 practices identified in Smith and
   Stein's (5 practices for orchestrating productive mathematics
   discussions, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2018) seminal
   work on orchestrating productive mathematics discussions, but I argue
   that this practice has been under-appreciated and under-researched, and
   implementation remains challenging for many teachers. To address these
   issues, I explored the selecting of student strategies with two sets of
   upper elementary school teachers engaged in professional development
   focused on the teaching and learning of fractions. One set consisted of
   3 teachers who had demonstrated expertise in teaching that is responsive
   to students' mathematical thinking, and I explored the selecting of
   strategies in these teachers' classrooms. The other set consisted of 30
   teachers with varying levels of expertise in this type of teaching, and
   I examined their selecting of strategies during professional development
   activities. Findings led to the creation of a two-level framework that
   showcases teachers' criteria for selecting strategies for whole-class
   mathematics discussions. The framework, which extends and adds a
   coherent structure to selection criteria currently identified in the
   literature, highlights considerations related to the mathematics of the
   strategy, the author of the strategy, and the class engagement with the
   strategy. The framework, which is presented through a case, was designed
   to not only provide guidance for the purposeful selection of strategies
   but also to be accessible and useful to teachers at any phase of their
   development in being responsive to students' mathematical thinking.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, teaching mathematics ambitiously has received
   increased attention. In this paper, we argue that to materialize this
   vision in contemporary classes we need to understand how practicing
   teachers experiment with certain aspects of this teaching and what
   challenges they encounter. Toward this end, we focus on an aspect of
   teaching ambitiously-designing and using enablers and extenders-and
   examine how four elementary schoolteachers experimented with it in their
   practice while also participating in a video-club setting. Drawing on a
   corpus of data including lesson plans, videotaped lessons, pre- and
   post-lesson interviews, end-of-program interviews, and videotaped
   video-club sessions, and looking across the four cases, we sketch how
   these teachers worked with enablers and extenders and the challenges
   they faced. Our analysis helped identify certain components entailed in
   working with enablers and extenders during the phases of lesson planning
   and enactment; it also yielded a classification of observed and reported
   challenges encountered as teachers engage with this work. This mapping
   of work associated with designing and using enablers and extenders,
   along with the classification of challenges generated, can inform
   professional learning development attempts aiming to support teachers
   enact ambitious teaching by identifying and naming separate components
   of practice that merit consideration and by providing insights into the
   types of scaffolds needed to support teachers in teaching ambitiously.},

Abstract = {Mathematics teachers' identities profoundly influence how they interact
   with and position their students to learn mathematics. In this paper, we
   examine how a year-long teacher learning intervention supportive of
   student engagement in mathematics helped shift teachers'
   mathematics-related identities. We use an implied identity perspective
   as a theoretical lens to explore changes in what teachers perceive as
   legitimate ways of being as a result of their participation in the
   intervention. Data from pre- and post-intervention concept maps and
   focus groups with 15 grade 5-7 teachers of mathematics were integrated
   for this purpose. Teachers reported shifts in their identities,
   describing themselves as ``facilitators,{''} ``learners{''} and
   ``co-creators{''} of knowledge. We argue that such shifts in the
   mathematics-related identities of teachers can have practical
   consequences in terms of improving students' engagement, and in
   particular, their autonomy for learning mathematics.},

Abstract = {Learning to name and notice students' mathematical strengths is a
   challenging process requiring time and multiple iterations of practice
   for prospective teachers (PTs) to adopt. Mathematics teacher educators
   (MTEs) can approximate and decompose the complex practice of naming and
   noticing students' mathematical strengths so PTs learn to teach
   mathematics while emphasizing what students know and can do. This study
   uses two tools MTEs can use to support PTs as they learn to name and
   notice students' mathematical strengths: A LessonSketch experience, a
   digital platform with comic-based storyboards showing children engaged
   in a mathematics task, and a strengths-based sentence frame. Our study
   presents the findings from the 111 noticing statements from 18 PTs as
   they engaged in the LessonSketch digital experience and practiced making
   noticing statements about what children know about mathematics. The
   study found that after a sentence-frame intervention, the PTs are more
   likely to use strengths-based language and more likely to identify
   mathematical evidence in their noticing statements. Uncommitted language
   (statements that do not align with a strength- or deficit-based coding
   scheme), suggests a fruitful, yet complex space for supporting more PTs
   as they learn to name and notice students' mathematical strengths. The
   paper concludes with implications for future research in teacher
   education.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-256},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Inside the discipline, mathematical work consists of the interplay
   between stating and refining conjectures and attempting to prove those
   conjectures. However, the mathematical practices of conjecturing and
   proving are traditionally separated in high school geometry classrooms,
   despite some research showing that students can successfully navigate
   the interplay between the two. In this manuscript, we share perspectives
   from secondary mathematics teachers regarding what conjecturing and
   proving look like in geometry classrooms and possible rationales for why
   they are separated. We document that from the teachers' perspective, the
   activities of conjecturing and proving have different goals, draw on
   different resources, and require different actions from students. In
   teachers' eyes, these differences necessitate the separation of
   conjecturing and proving. By understanding teachers' perspectives on the
   activities of conjecturing and proving, we can better consider the
   constraints of the classroom environment and possibly design activities
   in which conjecturing and proving could be reunited to allow students a
   more authentic mathematical experience.},

Title = {Expert mathematics teacher educators' purposes and practices for
   providing prospective teachers with opportunities to develop pedagogical

Abstract = {Enhancing teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is essential to
   improving the teaching and learning of mathematics. Mathematics teacher
   educators (MTEs) need to help prospective teachers enhance PCK (Marks in
   J Teach Educ 41(3):3-11, 1990. doi:10.1177/002248719004100302; Mason
   2008). However, we know very little about the practices of MTEs,
   especially in mathematics content courses, as these practices are not
   widely researched or disseminated (e.g., Bergsten and Grevholm, in:
   Jaworski, Wood (eds) The international handbook of mathematics teacher
   education, vol 4, Sense Publishers, Rotterdam, pp 223-246, 2008; Floden
   and Philipp, in: Lester, Ferrini-Mundy (eds) Proceedings of the NCTM
   research catalyst conference, National Council of Teachers of
   Mathematics, Reston, pp 171-176, 2003). This phenomenographical study
   offers empirical findings on commonly identified purposes across ten
   expert MTEs who provided K-8 prospective teachers with opportunities to
   develop PCK in their mathematics content courses. Furthermore, our
   emergent findings indicated that expert MTEs also provided opportunities
   for prospective teachers to develop orientations toward teaching the
   subject, which prompted framework adaptations and articulations of
   ``orientations{''} as a construct discussed in the broader literature
   outside of mathematics teacher education research (Magnusson et al., in:
   Gess-Newsome, Lederman (eds) Examining pedagogical content knowledge,
   Kluwer, Dordrecht, pp 95-132, 1999). Research and practitioner
   implications from this study provide specific PCK-related learning
   opportunities of prospective teachers through the lenses of expert MTEs'
   (personal and professional) purposes and reflections on teaching, as a

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the process of becoming a teacher educator in
   the pedagogical use of digital tools in mathematics teaching. The study
   took place in the context of an in-service program during the trainees'
   engagement in their practicum fieldwork activities including the process
   observation-reflection-design-implementation-reflection. We explored the
   features of this context that facilitated the trainees' transition from
   the level of trainee educator to the level of teacher educator as well
   as the nature of the trainees' documentation work for teachers. The
   results showed that observation of other teacher educators' teaching in
   conjunction with reflection during the program's respective sessions
   facilitated the trainees' transition to the professional level. The
   identified operational invariants underlying the trainees' designs
   concerned the focus of their observation in teacher education
   classrooms, the importance they attributed to the constraints and
   opportunities provided by the wider educational context and
   epistemological issues regarding the teaching and learning of
   mathematics with technology. The analysis of trainees' designs revealed
   three kinds of documents (explanatory, instructive and facilitative) and
   corresponding roles of trainees during the implementation. These
   documents targeted different aspects of TPACK depending on the trainees'
   conceptualizations of teachers' roles either as students or of students.},

Abstract = {This study is focused on a period that poses several challenges for the
   development of mathematics teachers' professional identities and agency:
   their first year of teaching in schools. During this period, beginning
   mathematics teachers confront tensions and contradictions among the
   principles, ideals, and experiences encountered during pre-service
   education and the demands, and restrictions of their teaching practice
   in schools. This article approaches this topic by developing an
   interpretative case study centered on one novice mathematics teacher,
   Sol. The aim is to describe and understand the development of Sol's
   professional identity and agency during her first teaching year.
   Considering identity development as a diachronic phenomenon, we carry
   out a narrative analysis of the research data. The findings show that
   Sol developed her professional identity and agency through a process
   that gathered together the teaching practices possible inside her
   school, the positions she could negotiate as a newcomer inside the
   institution, and the cultural practices and discourses embodied during
   pre-service education. The results bring to the forefront the profound
   and tense interactions between the intimate and personal terrain of
   mathematics teachers and the social and cultural world of the schools
   where they work. Sol's case also contributes to understanding the role
   that a robust pre-service education can play in the development of
   beginning teachers' professional identities and in the possibility they
   could become agents of transformation in their schools.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Month = {2024 MAR 6},
Abstract = {This study explored teachers' self-efficacy in teaching mathematics
   (SETM) as related to their teaching profile and pedagogical practices.
   Using data from 327 New Zealand primary teachers, a multilevel
   structural equation model was constructed and analyzed that looked at
   the relationships among SETM and effective pedagogical practice scales
   and included characteristics related to the teachers and their schools.
   No significant gender, year level, or school socioeconomic differences
   were found with teachers' SETM. Experienced teachers had significantly
   higher SETM scores than their inexperienced colleagues. Teachers who
   were self-efficacious in their mathematics teaching reported pedagogical
   practices known to be effective in the mathematics classroom in contrast
   to their low self-efficacy colleagues.},

Abstract = {Examining teachers' knowledge on a large scale involves addressing
   substantial measurement and logistical issues; thus, existing teacher
   knowledge assessments have mainly consisted of selected-response items
   because of their ease of scoring. Although open-ended responses could
   capture a more complex understanding of and provide further insights
   into teachers' thinking, scoring these responses is expensive and time
   consuming, which limits their use in large-scale studies. In this study,
   we investigated whether a novel statistical approach, topic modeling,
   could be used to score teachers' open-ended responses and if so, whether
   these scores would capture nuances of teachers' understanding. To test
   this hypothesis, we used topic modeling to analyze teachers' responses
   to a proportional reasoning task and examined the associations of the
   topics identified through this method with categories identified by a
   separate qualitative analysis of the same data as well as teachers'
   performance on a measure of ratios and proportional relationships. Our
   findings suggest that topic modeling seemed to capture nuances of
   teachers' responses and that such nuances differentiated teachers'
   performance on the same concept. We discuss the implications of this
   study for education research.},

   problem posing for integer addition and subtraction},

Abstract = {Elementary and middle school prospective teachers participated in
   semi-structured problem posing for integer addition and subtraction. The
   prospective teachers (n = 98) posed a variety of different stories, but
   this paper focuses on the temperature stories they posed. Results
   include descriptions of their posed temperature stories through the lens
   of the various dimensions (i.e., problem types, realism, consistency,
   correctness). Prospective teachers posed mainly state-translation-state
   problem types and rarely posed state-state-distance,
   state-state-translation, or translation-translation-translation problem
   types. They often changed the structure of their number sentences.
   Although they posed mostly realistic and mathematically correct
   temperature stories, the stories compromised realism or consistency in
   order to use state-translation-state problem types. Coordinating of the
   various dimensions (e.g., problem types, consistency) when problem
   posing requires flexibility with problem types. This work highlights the
   complexity of posing temperature stories, and coordinating the various
   dimensions highlights the need for prospective teachers to experience
   problem posing. Implications for problem posing with integers and
   temperature are extended to all contexts that inherently support
   translation and relativity. In the discussion, we coordinate the
   different problem types with various number sentences and dimensions.
   Unpacking the various dimensions illuminates prospective teachers'
   thinking and offers a way of considering integers and contexts.},

Abstract = {Proportional reasoning is the ability to use multiplicative thinking and
   make multiple comparisons. It is known to be challenging for many
   students and at the same time, many teachers require support to develop
   sufficient subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge to
   teach the diverse concepts that underpin proportional reasoning. The
   data reported in this paper are drawn from the first year of a broader
   study aiming to promote the teaching and learning of elements of
   proportional reasoning across the curriculum by engaging primary school
   teachers in ongoing professional development that includes the
   implementation of a series of mathematics interventions, each of which
   included a research component. This paper focuses on the impact of
   implementing the interventions on the teachers' mathematical knowledge
   for teaching. Three structured interventions were implemented by eight
   teachers (Years 3, 4, 5) during each of three school terms. Data
   collected showed that engaging in this scaffolded type of practitioner
   research, the structured nature of the interventions, and reflection on
   the outcomes of each intervention promoted teachers' subject matter
   knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge.},

Abstract = {Mathematics teaching at secondary levels has proven surprisingly
   resistant to change over the past century. This study draws on two
   theoretical models to investigate how the process of changing secondary
   teaching in algebra through school-based professional learning might
   occur, and its relationship to different external and internal
   influences on teachers and researchers. A cyclic change model is used to
   discuss three different change pathways that were found amongst six
   practising secondary teachers participating in an algebra teaching
   experiment, one phase of a larger design-based research project.
   Meta-didactical transposition is used to examine the dynamics between
   teachers and researchers and the institutional dimension of professional
   learning. Affordances and constraints related to the teachers' internal
   domains and social contexts in responding to professional learning
   opportunities are discussed. The bidirectional nature of brokering
   processes between teachers and researchers during professional learning
   is examined.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Researchers have argued that integrating early algebra into elementary
   grades will better prepare students for algebra. However, currently
   little research exists to guide teacher preparation programs on how to
   prepare prospective elementary teachers to teach early algebra. This
   study examines the insights and challenges that prospective teachers
   experience when exploring early algebraic reasoning. Results from this
   study showed that developing informal representations for variables and
   unknowns and learning about the two interpretations of the equal sign
   were meaningful new insights for the prospective teachers. However, the
   prospective teachers found it a conceptual challenge to identify the
   relationships contained in algebraic expressions, to distinguish between
   unknowns and variables, to bracket their knowledge of formal algebra and
   to represent subtraction from unknowns or variables. These findings
   suggest that exploring early algebra is non-trivial for elementary
   prospective teachers and likely necessary to adequately prepare them to
   teach early algebra.},

Abstract = {Launching a problem is critical in a problem-based lesson. We
   investigated teachers' perspectives on the use of a problem that was
   analogous to the one provided during a launch. Our goal was to identify
   teachers' underlying assumptions regarding what should constitute a
   launch as elements of the practical rationality of mathematics teaching.
   We analyzed data from four focus groups that consisted of prospective
   (PST) and in-service (IST) teachers who viewed animated vignettes of
   classroom instruction. We applied Toulmin's scheme to model the
   arguments that were evident in the transcriptions of the discussions. We
   identified nine claims and 13 justifications for those claims, the
   majority of which were offered by the ISTs. ISTs' assumptions focused on
   reviewing, providing hints, and not confusing students, whereas PSTs'
   assumptions focused on motivation and student engagement. Overall, the
   assumptions were contradictory and supported different strategies. The
   assumptions also illustrated different stances regarding how to consider
   students' prior knowledge during a launch. We identified a tension
   between ensuring that students could begin a problem by relying on the
   launch and allowing them to struggle with the problem by limiting the
   information provided in the launch. This study has implications for
   teacher education because it identifies how teachers' underlying
   assumptions may affect their decisions to enable students to engage in
   productive struggle and exercise conceptual agency.},

Abstract = {This article explores the personal identities of two prospective
   elementary teachers as they progressed from mathematics methods
   coursework into their capstone student teaching semester. Results
   indicate that both prospective teachers perceived contrasting
   obligations of effective mathematics teaching in the teacher education
   and student teaching contexts, yet came to reconcile these differences
   in different ways. Whereas one prospective teacher was able to oppose
   the obligations set forth in the student teaching context, the other
   complied with obligations in both the teacher education and student
   teaching contexts. Implications for teacher education include
   differentiated experiences and placements, methods design, and explicit
   foci on students' mathematical thinking.},

Title = {The effects of functional moves in teacher questioning on students'
   contextualization of mathematical word problem solving},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 28},
Abstract = {Posing purposeful questions is one of the most effective teaching
   practices (NCTM in Principles to actions: Ensuring mathematics success
   for all. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2014). Although
   the types and functions of teacher questioning have been abundantly
   studied, research on the role of teacher questioning in students'
   contextualization process as they solve word problems is rather scarce.
   This study was conducted to investigate the function of six elementary
   preservice teachers' questioning, its impact on students'
   contextualization, as well as the successes and difficulties of enacting
   questioning. The collected data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   The findings indicated that the implementation of task clarification
   (TC) moves effectively enhanced contextualization only when students
   possessed a relatively strong sense of agency while solving word
   problems. Furthermore, when students' attentional focus was not
   appropriately redirected by the functional moves, including procedural
   understanding (PU), making connections (MC), the rationale behind a
   strategy (RA), and an alternative strategy (AS), their understanding of
   the contextual features and construction of mathematical relationships
   in word problem solving could not be refined. Implications for field
   experience design and future research on the quality of teacher
   questioning in mathematics teacher education programs are discussed.},

Title = {Teachers' perceptions of less successfully organized professional
   development practices in mathematics: A study of nine secondary schools
   in Shanghai, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers in China,
   especially in Shanghai, has received growing international attention.
   However, most of available research concerning Chinese PD has focused on
   successful practices, and far too little attention has been paid to less
   successfully organized PD practices, particularly for mathematics
   teachers in Shanghai. This study aims to examine key aspects and
   underlying reasons for less successfully organized PD practices in
   Shanghai from teachers' perspectives. The data were collected from 132
   mathematics teachers in 9 randomly selected secondary schools in
   Shanghai through a questionnaire survey and follow-up interviews. The
   results show that Shanghai mathematics teachers perceived ``time,
   duration and frequency{''}, ``assessment and management{''} and
   ``objective{''} as the three most unsatisfactory aspects in less
   successfully organized PD they attended, and they considered that
   organized PD practices were less successful mainly due to lack of
   assessment for the PD organizers and of necessary coordination between
   PD organizers at different levels. In addition, there were statistically
   significant differences in teachers' perceptions of various specific
   problems in different aspects about less successfully organized PD
   between teachers with different demographic features, such as length of
   teaching experience and gender. Implications of the findings of the
   study to Chinese educational settings and beyond are discussed at the
   end of the paper.},

Title = {Developing elementary mathematics specialists as teacher leaders during
   a preparation program},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 29},
Abstract = {This 5-year mathematics professional development project involves 27
   elementary teachers prepared and supported as Elementary Mathematics
   Specialists (EMSs) in high-need, urban schools. Our inquiry centers on
   their experiences in the EMS preparation program and the development of
   important outcomes, specifically productive beliefs and teacher
   leadership. Data were gathered at the end of Year 1 via surveys of
   mathematical beliefs, coaching beliefs, and coaching practices, as well
   as individual and focus group interviews. The findings provide insights
   into participants' growth and work as a more knowledgeable other,
   illuminating specific emphases of their efforts and influences of the
   project. When it comes to mathematical beliefs, as participants shifted
   toward embracing cognitively-oriented pedagogical beliefs, they became
   more efficacious in this learner-centered pedagogy. The findings also
   show variability in specific mathematics coaching practices, including
   those most participants were and were not using, and areas for
   improvement. Several themes are evident in the interview data: growing
   confidence for the uncomfortable, creating and finding spaces for
   stepping up, advocating for learned mathematics pedagogy, and building
   teacher capacity through interactions.},

Title = {STEM teacher education programs for preservice and in-service secondary
   mathematics teachers: a review study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Few studies have elaborated on how different types of integration can
   support teachers' learning and build their capacity to teach for the
   enhancement of students' STEM competence. Teaching in a STEM education
   context requires mathematics teachers to be able to effectively choose,
   design and implement appropriate tasks in their classes. Given the
   important role of teachers and tasks as vehicles for STEM education,
   this paper reviews literature on STEM teacher education programs
   associated with STEM tasks for preservice and in-service secondary
   mathematics teachers. After searching for and reviewing the 14 relevant
   articles, the analytical results indicated that (a) teachers' STEM
   knowledge and practices have not been commonly assessed as the outcomes
   of STEM teacher education programs, although they are explicitly counted
   as the goals of STEM teacher education programs; (b) the approach of
   multi-disciplinary concepts integrated with uni-disciplinary practice is
   mostly adopted as the approach to STEM integration; (c) task design
   features identified from the articles can be classified by elements of
   task design (i.e., goals, principles and instructional focus) and task
   design factors (i.e., disciplinary knowledge, cognition and
   metacognition, affect); and (d) most programs provide both acquisition
   and participation approaches to developing mathematics teachers'
   knowledge in STEM education. The review results shed light on the design
   and implementation of STEM tasks and STEM teacher education programs.},

Abstract = {This study explores secondary mathematics teachers' perceptions of the
   experiences that contributed to their capacities to understand
   mathematical modeling and to facilitate students' modeling experiences.
   The retrospective research methods and transformative learning theory
   frame used in the study honor teachers as adult learners and value their
   perspectives while providing a way to study the complexity of learning
   to model and to teach modeling. Data analysis identified triggers and
   knowledge dilemmas that challenged and prompted teacher learning as well
   as opportunities to resolve dilemmas through rational discourse and
   critical reflection. Patterns in teacher-identified meaningful learning
   experiences reveal a trajectory with strands that address aspects of
   doing and teaching mathematical modeling: mathematics, social aspects of
   learning, real-world contexts, student thinking, and curriculum. Results
   of this study provide a holistic view of learning to do and teach
   mathematical modeling, complementing studies of designed professional
   learning interventions that out of necessity target specific parts of
   the modeling process. The results both support and challenge common
   teacher education content and practices. The study illustrates the
   usefulness of retrospective methods to understand teachers as lifelong
   learners.},

Abstract = {Cognitively demanding tasks have been shown to support students'
   understanding of mathematics. How a task is launched, or introduced,
   determines how students engage with the task, as well as the type of
   work the teacher engages in during the task implementation. The authors
   designed a unit focused on launching a task where prospective teachers
   (PSTs) planned and enacted a task launch as part of their methods of
   teaching secondary mathematics courses. Participants in the study
   spanned three institutions. Using a curricular noticing framework, this
   paper describes how the prospective teachers (PSTs) interpreted their
   task by identifying key contextual features, mathematical relationships,
   and common language, and then focuses on how they responded to their
   interpretations as they planned to elicit and develop their students'
   understanding of those key aspects. This paper also describes how the
   PSTs responded to their interpretations in planning to maintain the
   cognitive demand of the task. Findings suggest that the prospective
   teachers valued student-centered approaches and used a range of
   pedagogical methods to launch cognitively demanding tasks. We also found
   the prospective teachers needed support identifying context in tasks and
   in determining how much to tell while maintaining the cognitive demand
   of the task. We conclude with implications and suggestions for methods
   courses on both launching a cognitively demanding task and on teaching
   practices more generally.},

Abstract = {Noticing is a skill that is not overtly observable yet is consequential
   to effective mathematics instruction. Researchers have found that
   prospective and practicing teachers can learn to notice, but little
   focus has been given to those who teach teachers to notice. The purpose
   of the study was to characterize mathematics teacher educators' noticing
   and their ability to interpret students' thinking and connect
   interpretations to evidence. Participants in the study included 16
   mathematics teacher educators who took part in a course designed to
   support noticing. Results indicate the mathematics teacher educators
   noticed at varying degrees and improved their noticing and incidence of
   connections between interpretations and evidence. Findings indicated
   that 19\% of participants had no shift in their noticing because they
   were at the highest level of noticing to begin with (Robust with Strong
   Evidence), which was considered advanced noticing. Twenty-five percent
   of the participants did not shift in their noticing at all and remained
   at Limited, which is considered an intermediate level of noticing. The
   remaining 56\% of the participants improved their noticing. The results
   of the study reveal that at the end of the course a majority of the
   participants were able to connect interpretations with evidence. These
   findings are important because they describe mathematics teacher
   educators' interpretations and evidence as they notice.},

Abstract = {Given the prevalence of research in undergraduate mathematics education
   focused on student reasoning and the development of instructional
   innovations that leverage student reasoning, it is important to
   understand the ways undergraduate mathematics instructors make sense of
   these innovations. We characterize pedagogical reasoning about
   inquiry-oriented instruction relative to vertices of the instructional
   triangle (content, students, and instructor). Through this lens, we
   analyze conversations of twenty-five mathematicians who elected to
   attend a workshop on inquiry-oriented instruction at a large national
   mathematics conference. Identifying differences in talk between two
   breakout groups, we argue that deeper mathematical engagement in task
   sequences designed for students supported deeper engagement in students'
   mathematical reasoning and engendered reasoning about instruction that
   was more frequently accompanied by rationale based in mathematics or
   students' reasoning about mathematics. Importantly, deeper mathematical
   engagement was observed when the discussion facilitator prompted
   participants to engage through a mathematical lens rather than an
   instructional lens.},

Abstract = {The idea that formal learning generalizes, or is transferred, beyond the
   conditions of initial learning serves as a basis for our educational
   system. That is, educators hope students will use the learning that
   develops in the classroom to productively reason about situations they
   have yet to encounter. Researchers in psychology and mathematics
   education have been conducting systematic investigations of students'
   transfer of learning since the beginning of the twentieth century.
   However, we still do not know how teachers, the people typically tasked
   with creating the classroom contexts within which student learning is
   fostered, think about this phenomenon. This study, thus, addressed the
   following question: What are teachers' beliefs about students' transfer
   of learning? In the present study, I interviewed 8 practicing teachers
   twice using instructional tasks related to slope and identified 6
   categories of beliefs they exhibited about students' transfer of
   learning. These categories extend current conceptualizations of transfer
   into the domain of mathematics education, represent beliefs that have
   yet to be articulated by transfer researchers, and provide a foundation
   on which mathematics teacher educators can begin to think about how to
   effectively support teachers in developing students who can make
   productive use of their classroom learning.},

Abstract = {Eight middle school mathematics teachers' perceptions and uses of
   curriculum materials and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics
   (CCSSM) were investigated. Adapting a noticing framework and models of
   dialogic instruction and direct instruction, teachers' noticing
   practices with curriculum materials and the CCSSM when planning,
   enacting, and reflecting on lessons were examined. Teachers who were
   committed to implementing the CCSSM and who were using one of two
   substantively different curriculum programs were purposefully selected.
   Data sources included multiple forms of interviews and classroom
   observations. The teaching evidenced three distinct noticing patterns.
   These patterns indicated that teachers' curriculum materials were
   associated with how teachers perceived and enacted the CCSSM. Teaching
   with a curriculum program that was designed as a thinking device
   prioritized the Standards for Mathematical Practice of CCSSM evidenced
   noticing that was consistent with dialogic instruction. Teaching with a
   curriculum program that was designed as a delivery mechanism prioritized
   the Content Standards of CCSSM and evidenced noticing consistent with
   direct instruction. Findings indicated that the designated curriculum
   and contributed to differing interpretations of CCSSM and served as a
   lens for noticing. However, a dialogic curriculum program was not
   sufficient to support dialogic approaches in practice. One pattern
   showed teachers planning dialogic lessons, but the lesson enactments
   were not consistent with teachers' plans, with evidence that the
   teachers were not aware that their practices differed from dialogic
   approaches. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study examines how various teacher characteristics and contextual
   factors are related to early primary teachers' beliefs about
   mathematical teaching and learning and teachers' attitudes toward their
   own learning of mathematics. A total of 396 early primary teachers
   across Nebraska participated in the study. Teacher characteristics and
   contextual factors were grouped into four sets: teacher professional
   background, teacher mathematical knowledge for teaching, teaching
   contexts, and students' experiences. Multiple regression analyses were
   conducted with each set of predictors separately, as well as with all
   four sets together. The results showed significant relationships between
   teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching and teacher-centered
   beliefs, motivation in learning mathematics, and anxiety toward learning
   mathematics. Teacher certification level, the number of college math
   courses taken, and perceived support from colleagues and administrators
   were also related to some aspects of teachers' mathematical beliefs and
   attitudes. The findings suggest the potential role of teachers'
   mathematical knowledge for teaching in improving teachers' mathematical
   beliefs and attitudes.},

Title = {Culturally crafted Lesson Study to improve teachers' professional
   development in mathematics: a case study in Italian secondary school},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 5},
Abstract = {This paper describes a Lesson Study in which in-service mathematics
   secondary-school teachers, collaborating with researchers, involve grade
   10 students in tessellation problems. The data are collected by an
   experiment carried out in the context of the ``Liceo Matematico{''}
   project, with three volunteer teachers. The experiment goal was to craft
   a collaborative design of the research lesson between teachers and
   researchers. The research aim of the paper is to examine the use of
   Lesson Study in the institutional and cultural context of Italian
   secondary school with the use of Cultural Transposition as a theoretical
   framework. The research is qualitative with idiographic aims, based on
   video research. The educational aim of the research is to provide a
   solid basis for a revamped in-service teacher education first in the
   context of the project, then in curricular context. Semiotic mediation
   is used to provide, within Lesson Study, the conceptual framework for
   teachers and researchers collaborative design of the research lesson.
   The results show that Lesson Study, as a foreign practice, is an
   opportunity for teachers to confront their teaching practices, to enrich
   their professional development, resulting in more awareness on their
   didactical action in and outside the classroom.},

Abstract = {Lesson study has been implemented in schools around the world as a
   method of professional development for teachers. Lesson study consists
   of five steps, among which the ``Research Lesson{''} and ``Post-lesson
   Discussion{''} are central. During the Post-lesson Discussion, after the
   teacher has commented on the lesson, all of the observers discuss the
   lesson, and the ``knowledgeable other{''} (koshi), a specially invited
   expert, provides final comments. The quality of these final comments is
   critical to the learning of the lesson-study participants, and,
   consequently, the koshi plays an extremely important role. However, few
   studies have examined the nature and structure of the final comments
   that koshis provide. This study analyzed the final comments made in
   three elementary-school research lessons in Japan by a highly
   distinguished university mathematics educator with considerable teaching
   experience and an outstanding reputation as a koshi. We found that his
   final comments clustered into seven categories, which we named: (1)
   considering the didactical value of mathematical content; (2) use of
   representations; (3) fostering positive attitudes to learning; (4)
   incorporating students' ideas into whole-class discussions; (5) giving
   attention to what students write down; (6) giving attention to the
   content of the board-work; and (7) teacher growth through reflection.
   These categories provide insight into the nature of final comments that
   are regarded as being particularly useful and may form the basis for
   less-experienced koshis to structure their final comments in lesson
   study.},

Title = {Characterizing mathematics teacher educators' written feedback to
   prospective teachers},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Mathematics teacher educators' (MTEs') written feedback is an
   instantiation of teaching practice and provides information to support
   the developing understanding of prospective teachers (PTs), yet no
   research has been undertaken to characterize such feedback. Research on
   feedback forms, including written feedback, has focused on information
   provided to learners that draws attention to different components of
   their performances or understandings, such as elements of the task and
   processes used to complete it. While no models of feedback or feedback
   systems prescribe what feedback should contain, factors that researchers
   have identified as impacting performance or understanding under some
   conditions have been identified. To explore MTEs' written feedback as an
   instantiation of practice and to characterize such feedback, we used a
   self-study methodology to analyze three MTEs' written feedback to PTs
   regarding their responses to students, including the process of
   attending to and using learners' mathematics in responses to written
   work. Findings showed MTEs used some practices described as effective
   feedback by building on to PTs' feedback to mathematics-learners. Yet
   they also provided feedback described as less than effective, such as
   redirecting PTs to attend to elements in students' work not addressed by
   the PTs but perceived by MTEs as important to address. In addition,
   findings illustrated that MTEs provided little feedback on PTs'
   self-regulation. We argue that if MTEs' written feedback is meant to
   serve as an instantiation of practice as well as provide information to
   PTs about their feedback practice, MTEs should explore their feedback so
   that the model provided operates as they intend.},

Abstract = {A critical role of mathematics teacher education is to equip teachers
   with understandings and ambitious practices that support effective
   mathematics teaching for students from diverse backgrounds, specifically
   connecting to children's mathematical thinking (CMT) and children's
   linguistic, cultural, and family funds of knowledge (CFoK). Drawing on
   data from a larger research project, TEACH Math, this longitudinal case
   study uses the lens of authority to examine one teacher's, Sena's,
   understandings and practices related to CMT and CFoK over a 4-year
   period, i.e., through mathematics methods, student teaching, and early
   career teaching. Findings identify changes made in understandings and
   practices related to CMT and CFoK, with a focus on the development of
   recognition and realization rules. Emphasis is placed on how authority
   was shared in the classroom and how this may have impacted one teacher's
   development of two very different learning-to-teach trajectories for
   connecting to CMT and CFoK. Implications for teacher educators focused
   on supporting novice teachers in developing ambitious mathematics
   teaching practices are discussed.},

Abstract = {Understanding how mathematics preservice teachers (M-PSTs) learn about
   issues of equity is essential to addressing the inequities that persist
   in mathematics education. In this article, we use (Gutierrez, in:
   Herbel-Eisenmann, Choppin, Wagner, Pimm (eds) Equity in discourse for
   mathematics education: theories, practices, and policies, Springer, New
   York, 2012a) aspects of equity (i.e., access, achievement, identity, and
   power) to describe the reported opportunities to learn about equity
   (Equity OTLs) in five purposefully chosen secondary mathematics teacher
   education programs. Data included interviews with M-PSTs and instructors
   from four types of courses-mathematics content, mathematics for
   teachers, mathematics education, and general education-in each program.
   The mathematics- and algebra-specific Equity OTLs were most frequently
   related to issues of access and achievement, whereas the Equity OTLs
   reported in general education courses were more often related to issues
   of power and identity. In addition, the two programs housed in
   universities with more diverse populations had a relatively greater
   reported emphasis on equity. Implications for teacher education and
   future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Given the challenges of scaling up content-related professional
   development (PD), the PD facilitators have gained increasing attention
   in PD research. In this mainly programmatic and structural article, we
   try to systematize existing research strategies which take into account
   the multifaceted and multi-level structure of PD research. We discuss
   the lifting strategy which draws upon structural analogies between the
   classroom and the PD level, the nesting strategy for research-based
   design, and the unpacking strategy for design-based PD research and
   locate these strategies within a Three-Tetrahedron Model for PD
   research. Thereby, we present a framework to systematize and explain
   existing research approaches and to identify necessary but missing
   research contributions. The article provides a language for initiating a
   discourse on research agendas which can support PD facilitators: The
   Three-Tetrahedron Model for PD research and design captures the
   complexity of learning and teaching at the classroom, teacher, and
   facilitator level that is needed to inform design and research into PD
   as well as to uncover gaps in the literature.},

Abstract = {Japanese lesson study was introduced to the West in the late 1990s.
   Certain widely disseminated publications and classroom videos, and also
   reports on international surveys of students achievement, led many to
   consider that Japanese mathematics teaching is highly creative and
   effective, with lesson study as a main explanatory factor. As a result,
   substantial efforts have been deployed in many countries to engage
   mathematics teachers in lesson study. In this paper, we argue that
   lesson study is but one element of a comprehensive Japanese
   infrastructure for developing teacher knowledge, both personal and
   shared, and that the functions and workings of any particular element in
   this infrastructure cannot be fully understood when viewed in isolation.
   In this paper, we offer a systemic (institutional) analysis of how these
   infrastructure elements interact in crucial ways. Specifically we study
   two episodes where a teacher's practice research is clearly motivated
   and supported by other infrastructural conditions, such as the
   possibility to present the outcomes at a regional teacher conference,
   and in a publication. Moreover, a central prerequisite for the creative
   part of lesson planning is a much more limited activity: the patient
   study and discussion of mathematical tasks and materials. This activity
   is also crucially supported by elements of the infrastructure.},

Title = {Preschool teachers' knowledge of repeating patterns: focusing on

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {This study investigates 27 preschool teachers' verbalization of various
   aspects of pattern structure as well as their knowledge of pattern
   structure while solving patterning activities. Aspects of structure that
   are investigated include the unit of repeat, its length and the amount
   of times it is repeated, and whether or not the pattern ends in a
   complete unit of repeat. Data collected in the beginning of a
   professional development program came from five different tasksdefining
   repeating patterns, comparing repeating patterns, drawing repeating
   patterns, extending repeating patterns, and choosing between different
   possible ways for extending repeating patterns when the given pattern
   does not necessarily end with a complete unit of repeat. Qualitative
   analysis was performed on the verbal tasks. Results indicated that most
   teachers referred in some way to the fixed structure of the unit of
   repeat and to the notion of repetition, but without focusing on the
   length of the unit of repeat and the number of times it is repeated. In
   addition, it seems that not all teachers are aware that a repeating
   pattern can end in an incomplete unit of repeat. Teacher educators can
   use this study to plan appropriate professional development for
   promoting teachers' deep understanding of repeating patterns. This study
   can also offer preschool teachers a way to vary two well-known
   patterning activitiesextending patterns and comparing patternsin order
   to promote an approach to patterning activities which focuses on
   structure.},

Abstract = {In this paper I present a case study of one teacher, Harriet, and how
   her beliefs and practices regarding ``equity{''} and ``social
   justice{''} in mathematics developed over several years. I use
   Valsiner's (Culture and the development of children's action: a theory
   of human development, 2nd edn, Wiley, New York, 1997) zone theory to
   examine the evolution of Harriet's views and practices of mathematics
   teaching that occurred during her participation in a long-term
   professional development program focused on supporting teacher
   leadership. Early in the program she shifted from advocating for and
   using direct instruction to taking a student-centered approach to
   mathematics. Initially, when presented with a range of perspectives on
   issues of equity and social justice, Harriet took up a view of equity as
   student-centered mathematics and actively resisted teaching mathematics
   for social justice. However, later in the program she began exploring
   teaching mathematics for social justice and came to see some value in
   it. I discuss mechanisms that supported her transitions and implications
   for the design of professional development and teacher education.},

Title = {Teachers' construction of meanings of signed quantities and integer
   operation},

Abstract = {Understanding signed quantities and its arithmetic is one of the
   challenging topics of middle school mathematics. The specialized content
   knowledge (SCK) for teaching integers includes understanding of a
   variety of representations that may be used while teaching. In this
   study, we argue that meanings of integers and integer operations form
   the foundation for the construction of SCK about representations used to
   teach integers. We report that teachers' concerns about teaching the
   topic of integers implicate issues of meaning, although this may not
   always be explicitly acknowledged by teachers. We develop a framework of
   integer meanings synthesizing previous research, and describe how the
   framework allowed teachers to investigate a wide range of
   representations including contexts and thereby construct SCK in a
   professional development setting. Teachers constructed SCK by connecting
   various meanings of integers with one another and with representations
   including contexts. Teachers made two important shifts, from exclusively
   using the state meaning of integers to including the application of
   change meaning to representations and from exclusive use of formal
   models to including contexts to teach integer addition and subtraction.
   An implication of the study is that frameworks of meaning for key
   mathematical topics could be an important component of pre- and
   in-service teacher education.},

Title = {Combining enactivism and systemic functional linguistics: a methodology
   for examining (mathematics teacher educator) language},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 29},
Abstract = {As mathematics teacher educators (MTEs), we are motivated by the lack of
   research concerning the language that MTEs use in initial teacher
   education settings. In this paper, we turn our attention towards
   developing a methodological approach to studying the language-in-use
   during teacher education situations, with a specific focus on the
   language of the MTE in the form of a monologue. The methodological
   approach that we present draws upon two theoretical perspectives,
   specifically, the situated cognition theory of enactivism and the social
   semiotic perspective of systemic functional linguistics (SFL). To
   develop this methodology, we explore both of these theoretical
   perspectives, focussing on their respective conceptualisations of
   language, from which we derive a set of methodological principles and
   practices. A significant feature of the methodology presented in this
   paper, is that it takes into account the researchers' relationships with
   the subject of research. Thus we propose this methodology as being of
   particular significance to practitioner-researchers studying the
   language of other practitioners within the same field (e.g. MTEs
   studying the language of other MTEs), as well as to the study of one's
   own use of language in mathematics education settings. From our
   methodological perspective we explore the meaning of quality research,
   proposing relevant criteria. We exemplify the methodological principles
   and practices by analysing a transcript of a mathematics teacher
   education lecture for prospective primary teachers in Sweden.},

Title = {Mathematical knowledge for teaching and mathematics didactic knowledge:
   a comparative study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 18},
Abstract = {This paper compares and contrasts two approaches that are widely used in
   the English- and German-speaking discourse on mathematics teacher
   knowledge: `mathematical knowledge for teaching' and `mathematics
   didactic knowledge'. It is proposed that these constructs are based on
   distinct theoretical and conceptual positions and origins. Mathematical
   knowledge for teaching is viewed as a utilitarian-pragmatic approach
   rooted in English-speaking traditions as it focuses on its use in
   teaching and represents a practice-based conceptualization of knowledge
   domains required for mathematics teaching. Mathematics didactic
   knowledge, on the other hand, is considered normative-descriptive as it
   is formulated based on didactic principles and broader theoretical
   perspectives, providing a theory-driven conceptualization of knowledge
   domains rooted in traditions of German-speaking didactics of
   mathematics. The paper further highlights similarities and differences
   in these two constructs through an examination of two central knowledge
   domains: specialized content knowledge (part of mathematical knowledge
   for teaching) and subject matter didactic knowledge (part of mathematics
   didactic knowledge).},

Abstract = {This study investigates the potential of rehearsal interjections to
   provide opportunities for novice teachers and teacher educators to
   discuss topics related to teaching the practice of mathematical
   defining. Through analysis of video recordings of seven elementary
   novice teachers' rehearsals about geometric definitions, we identified
   the problems of practice that initiated rehearsal interjections, the
   topics discussed during rehearsal interjections, and relations between
   initiating problems of practice and topics discussed. We found that
   initiating problems of practice focused overwhelmingly on pedagogical
   issues, with most related to aspects specific to the teaching of
   mathematical defining. Likewise, discussions during interjections tended
   to focus on definitional pedagogical topics. Although epistemic topics
   were mentioned, they were only conveyed implicitly and at times in
   conflicting manners. Moreover, few opportunities arose for novices to
   make sense of student thinking about definitions and the mathematics of
   shape. Our results illustrate ways in which the goal of improving
   pedagogy, although important, can overshadow learning of other aspects
   for teaching mathematical practice.},

Abstract = {As content-specific educational coaches, elementary mathematics
   specialists (EMSs) have emerged as school-based professionals who are
   needs-driven and work closely with school stakeholders in regard to
   mathematics teaching and learning. While leading mathematics education
   organizations have identified the specialized knowledge and skills
   required for EMS positions, how to best prepare these individuals is
   knowledge that the field is still exploring. This paper first presents a
   theoretical model for EMS preparation that aligns an emerging coaching
   tool, the Decision-Making Protocol for Mathematics Coaching (Baker \&
   Knapp, 2019, {[}DMPMC]) with the Professional Development Design
   Framework (Loucks-Horsley et al. in Designing professional development
   for teachers of science and mathematics, Corwin Press, 2010). The paper
   then presents a descriptive case study that examines the application of
   this model in an EMS preparation course. The findings indicate that
   assessing the coaching situation fostered administrative partnerships,
   revisiting goals increased specificity of anticipated outcomes, and
   applying research-informed practices increased EMS self-efficacy and
   advanced coaching agendas. Taken together, these findings suggest that
   integrating the DMPMC into an EMS preparation course led to positive
   changes in EMS candidate learning of professional development design.
   Notably, this is one of the first studies that documents the influence
   of a coaching education tool on EMS candidates' professional development
   design.},

Abstract = {In this study, we address the issue of mathematics teachers' personal
   and professional responsiveness to changing circumstances, such as the
   shift in external demands made on teacher practice due to the COVID-19
   pandemic. For investigating a such delicate issue, we take a theoretical
   approach, which is quite novel in the field of mathematics education:
   Lacan's psychoanalytical lens. Specifically, we will use this
   psychoanalytical lens to analyze a case study focusing on a primary
   school teacher during the first lockdown in Italy, during which school
   was organized exclusively in the form of distance education. The
   analysis of the teacher's crisis and the strategies she adopted to
   overcome this crisis give some suggestions about possible directions and
   issues to consider for future mathematics teacher training proposals.},

Title = {Critical moments: pre-service mathematics teachers' narrative arcs and
   mathematical orientations over 20 years},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {35-61},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study explores narratives about critical moments in mathematics
   learning written by K-8 pre-service teachers' (PSTs) in the United
   States over a 20-year period. These critical moments, such as a single
   memorable task, course, test, or comment from a teacher, had a powerful
   and sustained impact on PSTs' mathematics identities, which they carried
   with them as they entered the teaching profession. We classified
   narratives using McCulloch et al. (Sch Sci Math 113(8):380-389, 2013)
   and Drake's (J Math Teach Educ 9(6):579-608, 2006) categories and found
   a potentially new category, Taking the Reins. We also classified PSTs'
   mathematics orientations as either relational (oriented toward creative
   problem solving and conceptual understanding) or instrumental (enacting
   rote procedures without meaning) (Skemp in Math Teach 77(1):20-26,
   1976). Many PSTs identified a causal relationship between their
   mathematics orientations and narrative arcs: relational learning
   opportunities encouraged positive narratives, while instrumental
   learning opportunities either resulted in negative narrative arcs or
   positive but fragile mathematics identities that crumbled under minor
   stress. We found little variation over time in the nature and prevalence
   of the narrative arcs and mathematics orientations, suggesting that any
   changes in mathematics teaching practices over time were not reflected
   in students' learning experiences.},

Abstract = {Within a global context of more standardization of teacher preparation,
   programs in the USA are increasingly using standardized teacher
   performance assessments such as edTPA to evaluate prospective teachers'
   instructional effectiveness and readiness for their own classroom. This
   study was conducted in a state recently requiring successful completion
   of edTPA for initial teacher certification. Phenomenological methodology
   was used to examine the lived experiences of six elementary prospective
   teachers completing Elementary Education edTPA: Assessing Students'
   Mathematics Learning (i.e., Math Task 4) during student teaching. Data
   were collected via 24 individual, phenomenological interviews at
   specific phases during the student teaching semester. Whole-Part-Whole
   analysis revealed the prospective teachers found themselves in a state
   of elusiveness as they engaged in Math Task 4. Three themes provide the
   structure for elusiveness, including juggling Math Task 4 in student
   teaching classrooms, from relying on experts to standing alone, and
   navigating edTPA processes. Understanding prospective teachers' lived
   experiences with Math Task 4 provides insights into both needed supports
   for their successful completion of the task and some of the issues with
   a high stakes teacher performance assessment embedded in the student
   teaching semester.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the findings of an empirical research project,
   designed with a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodology.
   Our goal was to apply Wiener attribution theory with a
   mathematics-specific pedagogical focus as a lens for analysing
   reflections. Our database consists of the prospective teachers'
   reflections on self-performed lessons. Prospective teachers (N = 104)
   reflected on the mathematics lessons they performed. The first lesson
   was performed at the beginning of their teacher preparation programme
   and the second one at the end of the programme. A significantly larger
   number of participants exhibited predominantly internal locus of control
   regarding teaching situations at the end of the teacher preparation
   programme. Similarly, a significantly larger number of participants
   shifted their focus from general pedagogical aspects to the
   mathematics-specific pedagogical aspects of their teaching performance.
   Additionally, prospective teachers' who exhibited predominantly internal
   locus of control reflected more often on the importance of pupil-centred
   approaches. Despite progress in observed elements, we still have some
   concern regarding the overall situation of teaching early mathematics.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a study of university students' experiences of
   learning mathematics in an introductory differential equations course
   that takes an inquiry approach to learning and teaching. The students
   are on a trajectory leading toward a bachelor's degree in mathematics to
   be followed by a year-long teacher education credential program. The
   analysis of students' end of course presentations and written portfolios
   is framed with community of practice theory, complemented with analytic
   categories from community of inquiry, including notions of inquiry
   stance and critical alignment. Our social theorization of university
   mathematics education adds a complementary perspective to the more
   conventional cognitive and discursive analyses and is necessitated by
   the very nature of inquiry approaches to education. The analysis of
   students' presentations and writing leads to exploring their development
   of the notion of critical stance, which the students are seen to take
   toward the mathematics, their learning, and approaches to teaching
   mathematics. We find that the notion of critical stance can be distilled
   into three components: awareness, self-evaluation, and agency.},

Abstract = {The mathematics education field recognizes the importance of noticing
   children's mathematical thinking as a means for supporting children in
   learning mathematics (Sherin et al. Mathematics teacher noticing.
   Routledge, New York, 2010). Using the existing literature base around
   teachers' knowledge of children's mathematical thinking and
   participants' problem posing in response to children's mathematical
   thinking, we developed the Responding Rubric, which measures four
   elements of responding to children's mathematical thinking (group or
   individual responses, consideration of children's existing strategies,
   anticipation of children's future strategies, and a responsive problem).
   Using the Responding Rubric, we were able to illustrate elements of
   teachers' responding skills. Following our presentation of findings, we
   discuss how our results further our understanding around teachers'
   noticing skills and provide directions for future research.},

Title = {Using Eurostat data to teach statistics to prospective primary teachers:
   on how the context of the task may promote their social awareness},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 16},
Abstract = {The concept of statistical sense provides an understanding of the goals
   of statistics education and helps to clarify the design of activities
   that promote the development of statistical literacy, reasoning and
   thinking. The new approaches to statistics in schools mean special
   attention must be paid to teacher training. This training should enable
   them to develop their statistical sense while awakening their social
   awareness. Drawing on the idea of the cycle of learning from data, we
   developed an activity based on data extracted from EUROSTAT, with the
   goal being to find out how the social issues underlying the data might
   play a role in the development of a socially critical stance among
   prospective teachers. We also wanted to find out how the complexity of
   the data presented might interfere with a satisfactory resolution of the
   cycle of learning from data. In general, we observed that when the data
   were socially relevant and closely related to their interests, the
   activity generated opportunities for the development of their social
   awareness. However, the development of the cycle may have been
   constrained by the difficulties they encountered when handling data with
   characteristics typical of civic statistics. We conclude that not all
   the contexts that accompany the cycle of learning from data promote
   social awareness in the same way and that the data representations
   associated with the cycle must be aligned with the prospective teachers'
   prior statistical knowledge.},

Title = {Promotion and offering in professional development programmes for
   mathematics teachers: What happens when there's a mismatch?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 23},
Abstract = {The EU-funded project Supporting Mathematics and Science Teachers in
   Addressing Diversity and Promoting Fundamental Values (MaSDiV)
   (2017-2020) promoted inquiry-based learning as a pedagogy that supports
   diverse and multicultural classrooms. This project included the design
   of a professional development (PD) programme for teachers. This paper
   explores the mismatches between acts of promotion and offering in this
   PD programme when it was implemented in Malta with mathematics teachers.
   Findings suggest that a promotion-offering mismatch, especially when a
   PD programme forms part of an international project, is: (1) inevitable
   in view of the personal interpretations that participants construe from
   the texts that promote the programme; and (2) costly for everyone
   involved and for the quality of the PD experience itself. These results
   position mismatches as unwelcome occurrences. While it appears
   impossible to eliminate mismatches completely, the argument is made that
   the costs of mismatches could be mitigated by developing PD content and
   adopting a PD model that would increase the possibilities that the
   implementation of a PD programme maintains fidelity to the programme's
   principles. This calls for an approach to PD programme development and
   implementation that recognizes mismatches as a reality to be factored in
   from the design stage onwards.},

Title = {Some mathematicians' perceived and envisioned instructional
   relationships in secondary teaching and teaching secondary teachers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 17},
Abstract = {When it comes to content courses for prospective secondary teachers,
   mathematics faculty's intentions conflict with teachers' experiences:
   while faculty aim to influence teachers' future teaching, many teachers
   find these courses irrelevant to teaching. In this study, we investigate
   mathematics faculty's goals for content courses for prospective
   secondary teachers and how these goals connect to their vision of
   secondary teaching. This study makes two contributions. First, drawing
   on data from an interview study (n = 5) of faculty who have taught
   secondary teachers, we articulate these mathematicians' rationales with
   respect to teaching secondary teachers, particularly in capstone
   courses. Second, we contribute a conceptual framework that supports
   inferences about connections between content course activities and
   instructors' beliefs about secondary teaching. We conclude by suggesting
   that the dual triad that depicts our framework may support professional
   development and programmatic design.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study examined how prospective mathematics teachers
   attend to, interpret, and respond to student misconceptions through
   providing them a video-case-based professional development environment.
   A sample of 30 prospective teachers attending an elective course was
   asked to watch video cases about student misconceptions related to the
   concept of measurement. Then, class discussions were held on the
   misconceptions, reasons, and suggestions to remedy the misconceptions.
   Thereafter they individually wrote down their response to an open-ended
   question asking them how to remedy the misconceptions. Data obtained
   from the discussions and individual reports were analyzed using the
   content analysis technique with the framework of professional noticing
   of children's mathematical thinking. Findings indicated that the
   professional development environment provided prospective teachers with
   an opportunity to attend to, interpret, and then decide how to respond
   to student misconceptions. We found that while prospective teachers
   generally understand how students think and why misconceptions arise,
   they mostly provided partial evidence for interpreting. Moreover, their
   suggestions for addressing mathematical misconceptions were generally
   based on conceptual understanding. Our findings suggested that in order
   to acquire skills in noticing student thinking, it is important that
   prospective teachers have sufficient opportunity to reflect on likely
   misconceptions in a professional context.},

Abstract = {Researchers examining elementary teachers' mathematical teaching
   expertise-that is, teachers' knowledge both of mathematics and of how to
   effectively teach mathematics-have linked such expertise to student
   outcomes. But, given the increasing use of classroom observations for
   teacher evaluation in the USA, this study considers whether and how
   upper elementary teachers' mathematical teaching expertise is observable
   in everyday classroom observations. Using classroom observation data
   collected with the widely used CLASS observation instrument, this study
   examines relationships among observation data, student outcome data, and
   data on opportunities for professional learning from 298 upper
   elementary teachers in four urban school districts in the USA. Using
   principal components analysis, this study isolates an observable
   dimension of mathematical teaching expertise. Regression analyses then
   identify statistically significant relationships among observed
   mathematical teaching expertise and multiple student outcomes, including
   mathematics learning and self-efficacy, as well as teacher professional
   learning through collaboration with mathematics coaches. Our findings
   inform strategies for observing mathematical teaching expertise,
   strengthening the practices of upper elementary teachers, and improving
   student experiences in the upper elementary grades.},

Abstract = {The successful use of lesson plans as the primary vehicle for storing
   and sharing teachers' instructional knowledge in Japan has given impetus
   to calls by US researchers for the development of a system for sharing
   teachers' knowledge through instructional products to improve teachers'
   capacity to implement high-quality instruction and to build a knowledge
   base for instruction. These products would be created by, and for,
   teachers to use in guiding instruction, thus building and sharing
   teachers' instructional knowledge. In this study, we try to characterize
   one aspect of teacher knowledge that is central in building a knowledge
   base for instruction, knowledge of student mathematical thinking. We
   analyze ten written instructional products from the USA and Japan to
   better understand what knowledge of student mathematical thinking can be
   shared in such products. We also look at how knowledge of student
   mathematical thinking is used to guide and justify instructional
   decisions. One key finding is that the knowledge of student mathematical
   thinking shared in the top written instructional products isspecificto a
   task or mathematical topic,variedwith descriptions of multiple solutions
   or ways of reasoning, and sufficientlydetailedto make the knowledge
   usable for teachers.},

Abstract = {Most prospective secondary mathematics teachers complete a course in
   real analysis, yet view the content as unrelated to their future
   teaching. We leveraged a theoretically motivated instructional model to
   design modules for a real analysis course that could inform secondary
   teachers' pedagogy, focusing on how this model was implemented in a
   single module about attending to scope. The central aim is to document
   how teachers' experience in this real analysis course influenced their
   subsequent teaching. In the majority of lessons we observed from six
   participating teachers, the following occurred: (i) the teacher
   explicitly attended to the scope of statements discussed in class; and
   (ii) in post-class interviews, the teacher highlighted their deliberate
   attention to scope and attributed this behavior to their experience in
   the experimental real analysis course. We discuss the design approach,
   its relation to teachers' actions in the classroom, and potential
   implications for teacher education in advanced content courses.},

Title = {Conceptions of teaching and justice as pivotal to mathematics teacher
   educators' thinking about mathematical knowledge for teaching},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 10},
Abstract = {Recent scholarship has explored mathematical demands faced by
   mathematics teacher educators and ways to support their development, but
   little attention has been given to the basic question of how mathematics
   teacher educators think about content knowledge for teaching. Knowing
   what they think could inform efforts to support them. Our analysis
   reveals that some think about mathematical knowledge for teaching as an
   independent, abstracted resource to be taught and learned in relative
   isolation from teaching, while others think about it as dynamic,
   situated work. We argue that this key difference matters for how they
   work with teachers. Further, our analysis reveals that their thinking
   about both teaching and justice interacts with their thinking about
   mathematical knowledge for teaching and that their thinking in these
   other two domains can be a resource for supporting their mathematical
   development.},

Abstract = {Estonian students achieved high scores in the latest Programme for
   International Student Assessment surveys. At the same time, there needs
   to be more knowledge about the teachers guiding these students, as this
   could provide insights into effective teaching methods that can be
   replicated in other educational contexts. According to the Teaching and
   Learning International Survey, Estonian teachers' average age is among
   the highest in the world, and the shortage of young, qualified
   mathematics teachers is well-documented. The present study aimed to map
   the motivating and demotivating factors for mathematics teachers to
   continue working in this profession. The effective sample comprised 164
   Estonian mathematics teachers who responded to items regarding
   self-efficacy and job satisfaction and open-ended questions about
   motivating and demotivating factors regarding their work. The results
   showed that students, salary and vacation, and job environment are both
   motivating and demotivating for mathematics teachers. On the one hand,
   helping the students to succeed (and witnessing the progress),
   satisfying salaries and a good job climate motivate the teachers. And at
   the same time, students' low motivation, poor salary, and straining work
   conditions (e.g., very high workload) serve as demotivating factors. We
   showed that mathematics teachers' work experience is an essential factor
   to be considered when thinking about motivating and demotivating factors
   for teachers, as well as their self-efficacy and job satisfaction. The
   reasons, possible impact, and potential interventions on an educational
   policy level are discussed.},

Month = {2023 APR 10},
Abstract = {This study investigates what mathematicians, who teach academic
   mathematics courses to secondary school mathematics teachers, want to
   teach them about the discipline of mathematics. Data sources included
   interviews with five research mathematicians. The data analysis revealed
   that expanding teachers' knowledge about the discipline of mathematics
   was one of the interviewees' main objectives. The mathematicians
   referred to nine characteristics that can be grouped into three key
   aspects: (1) essence of mathematics, (2) doing mathematics, and (3)
   worth of mathematics. The characteristics of the discipline of
   mathematics generated in our study are in line with ideas and practices
   widely advocated in the last decades for the teaching and learning of
   mathematics, and with contemporary philosophical approaches regarding
   mathematics. The potential of the characteristics to serve as a
   conceptual framework in studies that focus on teacher knowledge about
   the discipline of mathematics is discussed.},

Abstract = {Kyouzaikenkyuu (translated as instructional materials research) is said
   to be a crucial part of successful Japanese lesson study. Kyouzaikenkyuu
   is described as the planning portion of the research lesson during
   lesson study. Kyouzaikenkyuu is also said to be done on a daily basis by
   Japanese teachers; however, there is very little written about this
   process in the literature. This study takes an in-depth look into what
   Japanese junior high mathematics teachers do during their daily
   kyouzaikenkyuu, and why they do it. Through interviews, observations,
   and participation in kyouzaikenkyuu, we explain the process and key
   ideas that many Japanese mathematics teachers go through to prepare
   their lessons. We document two different approaches to kyouzaikenkyuu.
   We also found that for some teachers there is a large difference between
   what they do during kyouzaikenkyuu for a research lesson compared to the
   kyouzaikenkyuu of a daily lesson. If teachers outside of Japan wish to
   engage in kyouzaikenkyuu and lesson study, these approaches are a good
   place to start.},

Title = {Balancing competing demands: Enhancing the mathematical problem posing

Abstract = {Responding to mathematical problems is a core activity in classrooms.
   The problems that teachers select determine the mathematical content,
   processes and nature of mathematical inquiry occurring in classrooms and
   thereby contribute to the development of mathematical skills and
   dispositions. Selecting, designing or reformulating mathematical
   problems is a critical skill, then, for prospective and practising
   teachers. This study explores the influence of a mathematical letter
   writing initiative in developing the problem posing skills of 28
   prospective primary teachers. We examine the characteristics of
   mathematical problems designed by prospective teachers, and their
   understandings of what constitutes a good mathematical problem, prior to
   and following completion of a 12-week letter writing initiative with
   10-11-year-old children. Analysis of the data reveals the benefits of
   engaging in the initiative as evidenced in improvements in several
   problem characteristics. There was an increase in the number of multiple
   approach and multiple solution problems and in the level of cognitive
   demand of problems posed. The challenge of posing non-traditional
   problems, alongside the competing demands of building in opportunities
   for success, may have diminished participants' ability to evaluate and
   attend to the cognitive demand of problems.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of how school mathematics credentials,
   particularly calculus, coupled with elite college degrees can allow for
   presumed proficiencies, resulting in acceptance to a selective
   alternative route program (SARP) for secondary mathematics. However,
   such credentials do not guarantee deep mathematics knowledge nor
   effective teaching, particularly in low-income schools serving a
   majority of Black and Latinx students. We present a portrait of two NYC
   Teaching Fellows secondary mathematics teachers, their mathematics
   preparation and credentials, and how their supervisors viewed them. We
   further present findings from two years of classroom observations and
   show that these SARP mathematics teachers resorted to the direct,
   procedural teaching style they had known themselves, held superficial
   mathematical understandings, regularly made math errors, and often
   struggled to coherently answer students' mathematical questions.},

Abstract = {In this study, we specify teacher's knowledge and beliefs that influence
   their enactment of mathematics tasks. The use of tasks in lessons
   requires teachers to consider students' mathematical thinking and to
   know how to effectively implement tasks. Among the many aspects of
   teachers' understanding of students and ability to implement tasks for
   learning, this study focuses on teachers' knowledge and beliefs of
   students' prior knowledge and the potential to develop new knowledge
   while solving mathematical tasks; we exemplify these knowledge and
   beliefs through the practices of three Algebra I teachers. Three
   distinct conceptions of prior knowledge and two conceptions of the
   potential of a task emerged. From combinations of these conceptions, we
   defined three types of teaching. Two types of teaching reduced potential
   new knowledge to the prior context, whereas one type of teaching
   promoted prior knowledge to develop new knowledge. In particular, the
   type of teaching we call ``reviewing{''} explains why teachers repeat
   the way they taught a concept the first time. Our study suggests that it
   is important for teachers to conceive students' prior knowledge as the
   knowledge to be developed and the task as having potential for
   developing new knowledge in order to teach for coherence.},

Abstract = {To teach adaptively, teachers should be able to take the students' level
   of knowledge into account. Therefore, a key component of pedagogical
   content knowledge (PCK) is the ability to assume the students'
   perspectives. However, due to the so-called expert blind spot, teachers
   tend to misestimate their students' knowledge, such as when estimating
   the difficulty of a given task. This empirically well-documented
   estimation bias is predicted by Nickerson's anchoring and adjustment
   model, which generally explains how people take on other people's
   perspectives. In this article, we present an intervention study that
   aims to improve the accuracy of prospective teachers' judgments of task
   difficulty in the area of functional thinking. Two types of treatments
   are derived from Nickerson's model. In the first condition (PCK group),
   participants acquire knowledge about task characteristics and students'
   misconceptions. The second condition (sensitizing group) serves to
   control the idea that potential improvements in the PCK group are not
   merely based on a pure sensitization of the expert's estimation bias.
   Accordingly, these participants are only informed about the general
   tendency of overestimating task difficulties. The results showed that
   the PCK group improved both in terms of the accuracy of the estimated
   solution rates and the accuracy of rank order, whereas the sensitizing
   group only improved in regard to the former. Thus, the study shows that
   prospective teachers' diagnostic judgments can be improved by teaching
   them relevant PCK in a short amount of time.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 26},
Abstract = {This study examines changes in secondary mathematics teachers' noticing
   of argumentation through experiencing a peer-assessment cycle. Sixty-one
   teachers participated in such a cycle comprised of (a) analyzing a
   written argumentation classroom situation (ACS) using a report format,
   (b) collaboratively assessing peers' ACS-reports using an ACS rubric
   format and providing feedback to peers, (c) receiving feedback from
   peers and individually refining the initial ACS-reports, and (d)
   reflecting on their experience. Analysis of teachers' initial and
   refined ACS-reports revealed changes in teachers' noticing of various
   dimensions associated with argumentation. Analysis of teachers' written
   reflections and semi-structured interviews provided insights into the
   characteristics of the experience that supported or inhibited the change
   in their noticing of argumentation, from their perspective. The study
   provides evidence of the potential of the peer-assessment-cycle process
   for teachers' learning to notice key aspects of argumentation.},

Title = {I find this task interesting, so do you? Preservice teachers' judgments
   of students' enjoyment, boredom, and situational interest regarding
   tasks with and without a connection to reality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Students' emotions (e.g., enjoyment, boredom) while doing math and their
   situational interest in mathematics are important for their learning of
   mathematics, but examinations of teachers' judgments of students'
   emotions and interest while solving tasks are rare. Moreover, we do not
   know much about the predictors of teachers' judgments of students'
   emotions and interest. In this study, we addressed preservice teachers'
   judgments of students' task-specific enjoyment, boredom, and situational
   interest and analyzed whether such judgments are related to preservice
   teachers' own enjoyment, boredom, and interest. Furthermore, we aimed to
   analyze whether preservice teachers' judgments differ between the two
   types of tasks under investigation (tasks with and without a connection
   to reality). To achieve these aims, 182 preservice teachers were
   randomly assigned to one of two study conditions. In one condition,
   preservice teachers' judgments of task-specific emotions and situational
   interest for fictitious 9th-grade students were measured, and in the
   second condition, preservice teachers' own task-specific emotions and
   situational interest were measured. The results show that preservice
   teachers' judgments of students' task-specific emotions and situational
   interest differ for tasks with and without a connection to reality.
   Further, our findings indicate that preservice teachers' judgments of
   students' task-specific emotions and interest differ from preservice
   teachers' own task-specific emotions and interest. Implications for
   theoretical models of teachers' judgments and consequences for teacher
   education are discussed.},

Title = {Evaluating mathematics lessons for cognitive demand: Applying a

Abstract = {In this study, we examine ``what went wrong{''} in our professional
   development program for encouraging cognitively demanding instruction,
   focusing on the difficulties we encountered in using an observational
   tool for evaluating this type of instruction and reaching inter-rater
   reliability. We do so through the lens of a discursive theory of
   teaching and learning. Data consisted of 10 coders' coding sheets while
   learning to apply the Coding Rubric for Video Observations tool on a set
   of recorded mathematics lessons. We show that some discrepancies between
   novice coders and experts were found in narratives about valued actions
   relating to social aspects of teaching, such as teacher explanations and
   students' struggle and discussion. These were relatively easy to detect
   from the written evaluations in the coding sheets. More problematic to
   pinpoint were places where discrepancies were found between novice and
   experts' stories about the mathematical objects discussed. These
   required re-observing the recorded lessons. The analysis revealed that
   novice coders referred to objects about which the observed teacher
   mainly explained calculations, whereas the experts searched for (often,
   signaling the absence of) mathematical objects that invited exploration.
   We discuss these findings based on a theory of different Pedagogical
   Discourses that form the background for expert and novice coders'
   interpretations of the coding manual. We conclude with practical
   implications for the process of achieving inter-rater reliability on
   observation tools for cognitively demanding instruction.},

Title = {The use of a scriptwriting task as a window into how prospective
   teachers envision teacher moves for supporting student reasoning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 28},
Abstract = {The development of mathematical reasoning skills has increasingly been
   of focus for the teaching and learning of mathematics. This research
   utilizes a teaching simulation using the methodology of scriptwriting,
   in which prospective teachers are asked to complete a script of a
   dialogue from a classroom simulation involving fraction multiplication
   and division with justification, assisting fictional students to work
   through their difficulties and helping them to justify their reasoning.
   Such tasks allow for the examination of the prospective teacher moves to
   support student reasoning through their imagined action and choice of
   words. Scripts from forty-one prospective primary teachers were examined
   for the study, and five clusters based on the type of teacher move for
   supporting student reasoning were found. Overall, the prospective
   teachers emphasized the elicitation and facilitation of students' ideas.
   The cluster analysis, however, provided a nuanced examination of the
   cohort's teacher moves. While cluster one saw the highest incident of
   eliciting teacher moves, albeit only in the low potential category,
   clusters two and three mostly used facilitating teacher moves, but
   varied in their use of high and low potential moves. Cluster four
   concentrated moves on facilitating, eliciting, and responding to student
   reasoning. Cluster five employed teacher moves from all main categories,
   with some instances of high potential moves in all categories except
   extending student reasoning, which can better support reasoning. The
   prospective mathematics teachers' scripts and the five clusters that
   were found during analysis are discussed with implications for future
   teacher education and the support of building mathematical reasoning.},

Abstract = {When implementing educational innovations, teachers' approaches to
   integrating new teaching demands are a crucial factor in their
   professional development. This becomes especially important in inclusive
   mathematics education, where teachers are demanded to integrate two
   jobs: (a) create joint learning experiences for all students and (b)
   provide focused learning opportunities for individuals. These jobs and
   the orientations in which they are pursued are perceived as conflicting
   demands by some teachers, while others do not. Within the model of
   content-related teacher expertise, this qualitative study investigates
   teachers' practices for integrating these demands by disentangling the
   interplay between teachers' self-reported practices and their underlying
   orientations about inclusive education. The analysis reveals that only
   some teachers explicate conflicts between inclusive teaching demands. It
   also shows that teachers command a variety of different practices for
   dealing with the new teaching demands and that some complex practices
   can indeed integrate different demands simultaneously. Implications
   include the insight that professional development programs on inclusive
   education should pay careful attention to teachers' articulated jobs and
   orientations in order to promote the integration of teaching demands.
   Beyond this specific professional development content, the search for
   practices for integrating demands arising from an interplay of jobs and
   orientations might be a promising professional development research
   approach for increasing the scope of professional development.},

Title = {Contradicting activity systems-learning from large-scale interventions

Abstract = {The implementation of large-scale intervention and development projects
   is often problematic, and the impacts of such projects usually fall
   somewhat short of what was expected. Additionally, the rationalities of
   intervention projects are not carried over into classroom teaching as
   directly as expected. This problem is generally known, but comprehensive
   explanations continue to elude the research community at large. Using
   the theory of cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), we propose
   that the heart of the problem lies in the expansive learning process
   that teachers undergo. This process is driven by unrecognised
   contradictions in terms of cultural and historical origin, which are
   fundamentally different from the processes governing the projects. We
   analyze two cases taken from two large Danish professional development
   projects. In each case, we focus on a teacher as part of two activity
   systems ('the project' and `the classroom') and how the contradictions
   within and between these shape learning through epistemic actions. The
   results indicate the importance of making these contradictions apparent
   and accessible to everyone in the activity systems. Because of these
   various contradictions, the agency conferred upon teachers leads to
   unintended outcomes.},

Abstract = {This study articulates the epistemological support of reflective
   practices for the professional practice of crafting mathematics problems
   in realistic contexts. The data were collected from 15 middle school
   pre-service mathematics teachers in two semesters as they were
   generating problems and engaging in three reflective practices, which
   served to elicit their knowledge-in-action. The prospective teachers'
   reflections indicated that the knowledge-in-action for crafting
   realistic mathematics problems encompassed various but particular forms
   of the content; that is, pedagogical, curricular, and interdisciplinary
   forms of the content. Thus, particularly for the professional practice
   of crafting realistic mathematics problems, the prospective teachers
   identified epistemological supports that blended not only content and

Title = {Building on student mathematical thinking in whole-class discourse:
   exploring teachers' in-the-moment decision-making, interpretation, and

Abstract = {Often, mathematics teachers do not incorporate whole-class discourse of
   students' various ideas and solution methods into their teaching
   practice. Particularly complex is the in-the-moment decision-making that
   is necessary to build on students' thinking and develop their collective
   construction of mathematics. This study explores the decision-making
   patterns of five experienced Dutch mathematics teachers during their
   novice attempts at orchestrating whole-class discourse concerning
   students' various solution methods. Our goal has been to unpack the
   complexity of their in-the-moment decision-making during whole-class
   discourse through lesson observations and stimulated recall interviews.
   We investigated teacher decision-making adopting a model that combines
   two perspectives, namely (1) we explored student-teacher interaction
   with regard to building on student thinking and (2) we explored how the
   teachers based decisions during such interaction upon their own personal
   conceptions and interpretation of student thinking. During these novice
   attempts at orchestrating whole-class discourse, the teachers created
   many situations for students to articulate their thinking. We found that
   at certain instances, teachers' in-the-moment decision-making resulted
   in opportunities to build on student thinking that were not completely
   seized. During such instances, the teachers' decision-making was shaped
   by the teachers' own conceptions of the relevant mathematics and by
   teacher conceptions that centered around student understanding and
   mathematical goals. Our findings suggest that teachers might be
   supported in their novice attempts at whole-class discourse by explicit
   discussion of the mathematics and of their conceptions with regard to
   student understanding and mathematical goals.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the types of questions that prospective teachers
   of mathematics asked their students during whole-class discussions, how
   these questions changed over time, and why. Four prospective teachers
   were interviewed at the beginning and end of a 10-week period of student
   teaching to elicit their views about the kinds of questions mathematics
   teachers should ask. One lesson per week, for eight lessons, was video
   recorded for each prospective teacher. These videos were analyzed for
   the kinds of questions the prospective teachers asked and the nature of
   the responses from their high-school students. We found that the
   prospective teachers initially expressed the view that it was important
   to ask questions that required students to explain their thinking-a view
   that aligned with what was promoted in their teacher-preparation
   program-and that they attempted to ask questions with unpredictable
   answers in the early weeks. Over time, however, they asked fewer
   questions overall, with an even greater reduction in the number of
   questions with unpredictable answers. Interviews revealed that the
   prospective teachers' views about what kinds of questions to ask were
   influenced, over time, by the responses of their students. The videos
   offered additional insights into the nature of the students' responses.},

Abstract = {Professional noticing of children's mathematical thinking (Jacobs et al.
   in J Res Math Educ 41(2):169-202, 2010) is a construct that is used
   frequently to understand the ways in which teachers attend to,
   interpret, and respond to children's mathematical thinking. In this
   paper, we present our analysis of prospective elementary mathematics
   teachers' (PTs') responses to a pedagogical activity designed to engage
   them in an approximation (Grossman et al. in Teach Coll Rec 111(9):
   2055-2100, 2009) of professional noticing of children's mathematical
   thinking in the moment of teaching, with a focus on developing responses
   which extend the student's thinking. PTs were provided two different
   examples of student work and a series of questions designed to elicit
   information about their ability to professionally notice student work.
   We present data and analysis of 73 PTs' abilities to engage in the
   individual skills associated with noticing as well as their abilities to
   use the skills cohesively in concert. Our results demonstrate the type
   of representation used determined PTs' success in all three facets of
   noticing, with a particular effect on interpreting. Further, our focus
   on a specific type of response move, along with the introduction of a
   scaffold for that response move, made a difference in PTs' ability to
   successfully respond to student work when compared to a prior study with
   the same PTs (Tyminski et al.2014). We unpack these results along with
   suggestions for pedagogical practice as well as directions for future
   research.},

Abstract = {Formative assessment practices for secondary mathematics have been
   advocated as valuable for students, but difficult for teachers to learn.
   There have been calls in the literature to increase the emphasis on
   formative assessment in mathematics teacher preparation courses. This
   study explored the use of peer-assessment strategies for helping
   pre-service secondary mathematics teachers (PSTs) cultivate formative
   assessment principles and practices for assessing school students.
   Twenty-seven PSTs participated in a peer-assessment cycle comprised of:
   sourcing a rich mathematics task; constructing an assessment rubric for
   it; and collecting and analysing a selection of secondary student
   responses to the task. Each PST then provided written and verbal
   feedback to a peer on his/her rubric and student solution assessments.
   We draw on theoretical conceptions of Teacher Assessment Literacy in
   Practice to characterize the PSTs' perceptions of their experience of
   formative assessment processes for learning to assess school students,
   in terms of cognitive and affective dimensions of their conceptions of
   assessment. The cohort evidenced a wide range of levels of confidence
   with the various aspects of formative assessment practices but on
   average less confidence in assessing school student task responses
   themselves than in assessing peer work. In addition to highlighting
   specific changes to different types of assessment knowledge, the PSTs
   also evidenced an awareness of shifts in their attitudes, in coming to
   view student task responses with more appreciation and humility.},

Abstract = {This study documented the process of evolution of the continuous design
   and revision of the tools of a novice mathematics teacher
   educator-researcher (MTE-R) as he planned and implemented design-based
   professional development workshops for in-service mathematics teachers
   in Taiwan. In order to effectively facilitate teachers designing and
   implementing their own conjecturing activities during the workshops, the
   MTE-R fostered their professional learning and growth through reflection
   upon students' performance. From the perspective of activity theory,
   this study examined the evolution of the MTE-R's mentoring activities
   and tools whose design gradually changed from being based on the
   literature content toward being learner-centered activities with
   teachers as learners. Such evolution not only enhanced teachers'
   learning outcomes, but also facilitated the MTE-R's own professional
   growth in different areas, including mathematics, mathematics learning,
   mathematics teaching, teacher education, and, in particular, the
   extrapolation of generic examples for understanding mathematical
   concepts.},
