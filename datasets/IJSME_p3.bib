Abstract = {Excellent Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
   employees are in constant demand worldwide. The current study explores
   Israeli students' choices to study and pursue careers in STEM fields,
   while students' level of excellence in mathematics in secondary school
   is explored as a predictor for choosing a STEM track in future study and
   employment, as well as a predictor for the level of success in
   completing a STEM degree. The theoretical framework for the study is
   based on the task performance model of the social cognitive career
   theory which focuses on human behavior in the context of career choice.
   The study presents a big data analysis based on about 650,000 records
   retrieved from the Central Bureau of Statistics in Israel for several
   points in time over the last one and a half decades, to demonstrate
   choice patterns over the years. We analyzed a representative sample
   using systematic sampling over the last decade and a half, from
   secondary school, higher education, and postgraduate STEM-related
   populations who are employed in STEM professions. Our study presents a
   scale for mathematics excellence, which reflects a combination of study
   level and level of success. Our findings reveal that choosing a more
   advanced level of mathematics in secondary school, as opposed to the
   level of success in these studies, is the best predictor for choosing
   STEM as a major in secondary school, completing a STEM bachelor's
   degree, succeeding in a STEM bachelor's degree, and making a STEM career
   choice.},

Abstract = {The more ambitious an educational innovation, the greater the challenge
   in scaling up. In this paper, we focus on the scaling up of an ambitious
   pedagogical practice-mathematics problem solving as a regular feature in
   the classroom. We adopt a long-term approach to continual professional
   development (CPD) that began with intensive work with one school before
   we broadened the programme to four other schools which span the spectrum
   of schools in Singapore. To evaluate this overall design, we examine the
   current state of each school's capacity in sustaining mathematics
   problem-solving instruction. In particular, we study and report findings
   on these areas: the readiness of teachers, the instructional materials
   and supporting structures. Based on the findings, we reflect on our CPD
   strategies and our theory of action which guided the CPD programme.},

Abstract = {In this article, a theoretically derived grid is presented combining
   Polya's phases of the problem-solving process with the way in which
   teachers emphasize their students' strategic diversity in problem
   solving. It is used to categorize previous results from the literature.
   In an empirical part, the grid is also used to describe mathematics
   teachers' behaviors in lessons on the topic of problem solving.
   Additionally, these teachers' beliefs regarding mathematics and problem
   solving have been obtained with interviews. Comparisons of the teachers'
   behavior and their beliefs reveal the importance of beliefs in the

Abstract = {This study aimed to give insights of in-service teachers' experiences of
   nature of science (NOS) learning and NOS teaching through a co-teaching
   professional learning context. For this purpose, the co-teachers were
   encouraged to share and discuss ideas and to improve NOS teaching
   through reflection and collaborative interaction in the context of a
   Saturday science teaching program. The program provided students in
   Grades K-2 with hands-on activities covering various science topics over
   5 weekly 2.5-h sessions. One co-teacher was an experienced university
   teacher; the other was an experienced primary teacher without NOS
   teaching experience. Data were collected by use of pre- and
   post-instruction of the Views of Nature of Science questionnaire,
   follow-up interviews, written artifacts, and videotaped teaching
   sessions. Results showed that co-teaching contributed to the teacher's
   NOS learning as well as NOS teaching. The teacher recognized subjective,
   creative, empirical, and sociocultural NOS; she started to use NOS
   vocabulary more comfortably and developed teaching strategies and
   examples for sociocultural NOS.},

Abstract = {Inquiry-based science instruction has been advocated for decades.
   However, the implementation of inquiry teaching and learning in everyday
   classrooms is rather limited due to various factors. Previous research
   investigated implementations of inquiry-based teaching at the activity
   level with self-reported methods. However, little is known about how
   inquiry-based teaching is enacted at the discursive level in daily
   classrooms. The purpose of the study is to explore how a science teacher
   orchestrates discourse to engage students in inquiry in regular
   classroom practices in Taiwan where the educational systems pose
   significant challenges to inquiry-based teaching. Specifically, the
   study used a two-dimensional framework to characterize the teacher's
   discursive modes and to document their changes over time from the videos
   of a semester-long, grade 10 Earth Science course. Three types of
   discursive modes were identified according to the characteristics
   presented in the cognitive and guidance dimensions: epistemic-thinking
   provoking mode, analogic reasoning mode, and cognitive-elaboration mode.
   The epistemic-thinking provoking mode and the analogic reasoning mode
   exemplify two forms of guided inquiry engaging students in epistemic
   thinking and scientific reasoning. The decrease in time spent on
   inquiry-oriented discursive modes and an increase in time spent on the
   authoritative, non-interactive mode reflected the pressure and obstacles
   imposed by the content-heavy curriculum and educational environment. The
   limitations of the epistemic talk in this Earth Science classroom call
   attention to disciplinary differences in scientific inquiry.},

Abstract = {The Force Concept Inventory is a multiple-choice test and is one of the
   most popular and most analyzed concept inventories. It is used to
   investigate student understanding of Newtonian mechanics. A structured
   approach to data analysis can transform it in a ``diagnostic{''}
   instrument that can validate inferences about student thinking. In this
   paper, we show how cluster analysis methods can be used to investigate
   patterns of student conceptual understanding and supply useful details
   about the relationships among student concepts and misconceptions. The
   answers given to the FCI questionnaire by a sample of freshman
   engineering have been analyzed. The analysis takes into account the
   decomposition of the force concept into the conceptual dimensions
   suggested by the FCI authors and successive studies. Our approach
   identifies latent structures within the student response patterns and
   groups students characterized by similar correct answers, as well as by
   non-correct answers. These response patterns give us new insights into
   the relationships between the student force concepts and their ability
   to analyze motions. Our results show that cluster analysis proved to be
   a useful tool to identify latent structures within the student
   conceptual understanding. Such structures can supply diagnostic insights
   for classroom pedagogy and teaching approaches.},

Abstract = {Equiprobability bias (EB) is one of the frequently observed
   misconceptions in probability education in K-12 and can be affected by a
   problem context. As future teachers, preservice teachers need to have a
   stable understanding of probability and to have the knowledge to
   identify EB in their students regardless of the problem context.
   However, there are few studies to explore how preservice teachers
   identify students' EB and how they respond to students' EB. This study
   investigated Korean preservice elementary school teachers' abilities to
   identify students' EB in two problem contexts, marble and baseball
   problems, as well as their teaching strategies for correcting students'
   EB within each problem. Ninety-six preservice elementary school teachers
   participated in this study. They were presented with two problems with
   students having EB and were asked to write lesson plays. From the
   analysis of their lesson plays, it was found that 87\% of the preservice
   teachers identified students' EB in both problems, and in the baseball
   problem, 13\% of them did not. Three teaching strategies for correcting
   students' EB in each problem were found. Based on the results,
   implications for preservice elementary teacher education were discussed.},

Abstract = {Makerspaces provide a viable option for constructing and sharing
   knowledge in schools. Inherent in the designing, tinkering, and playing
   that learners engage in through making are competencies, such as the
   ability to create, problem solve, and innovate, decreed as critical by
   education policymakers. This paper summarizes results from a study in a
   Canadian elementary school in which a researcher and a sixth grade
   teacher worked collaboratively to co-design, enact, and reflect on a
   makerspace project focused on sky science. Results with students showed
   higher engagement, deeper learning, and a way of being that extended
   beyond the study of one science topic. Results with the teacher
   demonstrated changes in pedagogical thinking about learning designs to
   enhance students' abilities to develop their own questions, to build
   models in attempts to answer those questions, and to embody the ontology
   of a scientist.},

Abstract = {This paper explores different ways in which mathematics students read a
   section of a prescribed mathematics textbook. In this case, the students
   are mathematics teachers learning new mathematics in a self-study
   calculus course. Two students were video-taped, while they studied a
   prescribed portion of the textbook. The reading styles of these two
   empirical readers are analysed according to how they exploit
   opportunities for learning from the textbook, how they inject productive
   knowledge such as prior knowledge, from outside the textbook, into their
   reading and how they make connections between different objects in the
   textbook. Their reading styles are compared to that of a hypothetical
   implied' reader. This implied reader engages with the text in a fruitful
   manner. The analyses are used as a platform from which to highlight
   productive and less productive ways for reading to learn mathematics.},

Abstract = {Mathematics education research has placed great emphasis on teacher

   elementary teachers. Extensive research has already been done; hence,
   this paper discusses possible future directions for research on teacher
   identity in mathematics education. Among other issues, we highlight that
   general education research on identity has infrequently informed
   research on mathematics-related teacher identity. This not only limits
   the transfer of knowledge but also isolates mathematics education from
   general education research. We suggest that connecting these lines of
   research and their findings may not only strengthen mathematics
   education research and mathematics teaching and learning but also
   contribute to less isolation within the discipline as a whole.},

Abstract = {This research took place within the context of ongoing educational
   reforms to promote inquiry-based science instruction and a desire to
   draw evidence to inform adoptions of western pedagogical practices in a
   high-context culture like Qatar. We report on the outcomes from Process
   Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) in a foundation chemistry
   course based on students' achievement, their perceived learning gains,
   and their self-efficacy. The study utilized quantitative data obtained
   from normalized content tests and instruments to measure perceived
   learning gains and attitudes and experience. Qualitative data from
   open-ended student questionnaires were analyzed to cross-validate
   findings from the study. Positive effects of POGIL during fall (semester
   1) and spring (semester 2) semesters were evidenced by (a) improved mean
   scores and medium to large effect sizes for content test results,
   perceived learning gains, and self-efficacy levels and (b) a positive
   correlation between the measures of perceived learning gains and
   self-efficacy. Students self-reported increased self-efficacy, interest,
   and better understanding of concepts using the POGIL method. Comparing
   fall and spring semesters, student reluctance and negative perceptions
   of the POGIL approach gradually diminished. Students were able to adapt
   easily to POGIL-a method of teaching that they had not experienced
   before but which was compatible with the high-context culture in which
   they live. In addition, this study reflects the current condition of
   science learning in Qatar, where the emerging outcomes of educational
   reforms play an important role in preparing local students to transition
   into higher education.},

Abstract = {Reported are the results of a multiyear study in which reading
   comprehension and writing were integrated within an in-depth science
   instructional model (Science IDEAS) in daily 1.5 to 2 h daily lessons on
   a schoolwide basis in grades 3-4-5. Multilevel (HLM7) achievement
   findings showed the experimental intervention resulted in significant
   and consistent direct effects in grades 3-4-5 and complementary transfer
   effects in grades 6-7 on both ITBS Science (+1.08 Grade Equivalent Units
   {[}GE]) and ITBS Reading (+.57 GE). Discussed are implications of the
   findings and related research for changing grade K-5 curriculum policy
   to allocate increased instructional time for integrated science

Abstract = {Recently, single-sex classes within public coeducational schools have
   proliferated across the USA; yet, we still know little about whether and
   how single-sex science classes influence adolescents' attitude and
   affect toward science. This exploratory study expands upon our current
   understanding by investigating the extent in which female and male
   students' enrollment in either single-sex or coeducational science
   classrooms may influence their academic self-concept in science.
   Utilizing a quasi-experimental research design, findings suggest that
   being enrolled in single-sex science classrooms influence how students
   in this study perceive their abilities to perform and learn in science,
   particularly for females in single-sex science classrooms.},

Abstract = {The current study addresses student perceptions of math and science
   professors in the Middle East. Gender disparity in science, technology,
   engineering, and math (STEM) education continues to exist in higher
   education, with male professors holding a normative position. This
   disparity can also be seen in the United Arab Emirates. As female
   participation in STEM education lags behind men, it is possible that
   gender stereotypes may influence students' first impressions of male and
   female instructors. The United Arab Emirates provides a unique context
   to study this phenomenon as it is a traditional patriarchal society that
   is highly dependent on the engineering discipline, especially within the
   oil and gas sectors. A total of 176 undergraduate students from 2
   universities in the United Arab Emirates completed a survey about
   teaching effectiveness based on their perceptions of photographs of
   hypothetical male and female instructors. A factor analysis of survey
   items revealed 2 main subcategories of teacher effectiveness: namely
   teacher warmth and professionalism. A 2-way between-groups analysis of
   variance was conducted to explore the impact of teacher gender and
   student gender on perceptions of overall teaching effectiveness, as well
   as their perceptions of teacher warmth and professionalism. Findings
   revealed that there was a significant cross-gender effect on student
   perceptions of math and science instructors in the United Arab Emirates.},

Abstract = {Identifying and expressing relations between quantities is a key aspect
   of understanding and using functions. We are aiming to understand the
   development of functions understanding throughout school years in
   Israel. A survey instrument was developed with teachers and given to 20
   high and average achieving students from each of years 7-11 and to 10
   high achieving students from year 12, a total of 110 students. Our
   analytical approach is to identify qualitatively what students appeared
   to do and whether their approaches led to complete solutions. We look
   for progress in understanding variables and relations between them, and
   we found that there does not appear to be a strong link between
   curriculum and informal understandings of variables and covariation, but
   there are other strengths.},

Title = {Examining Elementary School Students' Mental Models of Sun-Earth
   Relationships as a Result of Engaging in Engineering Design},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Current reform efforts in science education in the United States call
   for students to learn science through the integration of science and
   engineering practices. Studies have examined the effect of engineering
   design on students' understanding of engineering, technology, and
   science concepts. However, the majority of studies emphasize the
   accuracy of students' scientific thinking instead of what students'
   conceptions are. The aim of this study was to examine elementary school
   students' conceptions of sun-Earth relationships as a result of engaging
   in an engineering design-based science task. Two independent fifth grade
   classrooms were identified. Each classroom teacher had 2 groups of
   students: 1 group engaged in traditional science lessons (control) and 1
   group engaged in engineering design-based science lessons (treatment).
   Data were collected via multiple choice knowledge assessments, a
   draw-andexplain item, and semi-structured interviews designed to elicit
   students' working mental models of the relationship between the sun and
   Earth. Results indicated a range of five different mental models
   expressed by students in both the control and treatment groups. These
   findings suggest that students still harbor alternate conceptions and
   possibly conflicting ideas regarding various sun-Earth relationships. If
   teachers are expected to implement science and engineering practices,
   attention must be given to not only what students' misconceptions are
   but, more importantly, how best to implement design-based science
   lessons that facilitate students' application and understanding of
   related science concepts.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the design and the results of a comparative
   study that evaluated the success of a transfer of an online-teaching
   resource between two universities, one in Germany and one in the USA.
   The teaching resource is an online physics lab that has been used in the
   physics education of medical students in Germany since 2003. The online
   lab covers geometrical optics and the optics of the human eye using
   interactive screen experiments. It was translated and transferred to a
   university in the USA where it was used and evaluated with a group of
   pre-health students. In a cross-national study, students' backgrounds
   (demographic data, selected cognitive abilities, previous knowledge, and
   self-concept in physics), students' attitudes towards the online lab,
   and their learning gain were compared. The results show significant
   differences between the German and the US cohorts with regard to
   students' backgrounds. Despite these differences, the outcomes are
   similar, with slightly higher leaning gains for the US students.
   Students' attitudes towards the online lab are similar in both countries
   but tend to be more positive among the US students. The results indicate
   that the transfer of the online lab to another educational system was
   successful.},

Abstract = {This article documents the classroom mathematical practices observed in
   a collegiate level teacher education course related to the circle topic.
   The course, which was prepared as design research, utilized a dynamic
   geometry environment which influenced the type and nature of the evolved
   mathematical practices. The study uses emergent perspective as the
   theoretical framework and Toulmin's model of argumentation to analyze
   social interactions within the classroom. Findings reveal three
   sequentially emergent mathematical practices that are in increasing
   order of complexity. The significance of this analysis stems from the
   fact that it contributes to an emerging body of knowledge on
   inquiry-based and technology-supported teaching in social contexts for
   which more research is needed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to describe the images that a group of
   high-achieving Mexican students hold of mathematicians. For this
   investigation, we used a research method based on the Draw-A-Scientist
   Test (DAST) with a sample of 63 Mexican high school students. The group
   of students' pictorial and written descriptions of mathematicians
   assisted us in characterising their predominant image of a
   mathematician. The image that emerged was that of a male person dressed
   in a casual or formal fashion, with a formal hairstyle and, in some
   cases, wearing glasses. Furthermore, he is a happy, intelligent person,
   who enjoys his work and is passionate about mathematics. We discuss some
   implications of the results and suggest future work.},

Abstract = {Today, early science education is a well-accepted view. Enhancing
   children's curiosity about the natural world and fostering positive
   attitudes toward science are primary goals of science education.
   However, questions remain regarding the appropriate ways to identify,
   nurture, and study these emotional states in pre-schoolers. This study
   examines the potential of using pre-schooler's verbal (e.g.
   self-generated figurative expressions) and behavioral (sensorimotor
   interactions) responses while participating in a scientific activity, as
   indicators of curiosity and attitudes toward science. The responses of
   41 pre-schoolers were documented via a response questionnaire developed
   for this study. An integrated quantitative-qualitative approach was
   utilized for data analyses. Results show that pre-schoolers utilize
   figurative expressions to express various emotional valences. Generation
   of verbal expressions that entail positive emotional valences and the
   desire to engage in sensorimotor interactions during a scientific
   activity were identified as positively correlated. Additionally, girls
   were more likely to express curiosity and positive attitudes toward
   science than boys in the context of this study. The findings suggest
   that these verbal and behavioral measures may serve as indicators of
   attitudes and curiosity toward science among pre-school children.},

Abstract = {Several studies that suggest for the inclusion of students' cultural
   background into the mathematics curriculum fail to address gender roles
   within cultures and the impact it will have on the understanding of
   academic mathematics. This paper reports a study of high school
   students' involvement in everyday material production and its connection
   to geometric performance, on 20 students from a rural setting secondary
   school, in Tigray, Ethiopia. An interview involving six questions each
   followed by a mathematical question was administered to the group of
   participating students. The analyses of the interview and the
   mathematical questions have come up with the following findings: (1)
   some everyday materials are identified as male-orientated and hence, the
   male students show better fluency in basic geometry for practical
   utility which have connections with their domain; (2) some other
   activities and the production of everyday materials are found as
   female-orientated and therefore, the female students demonstrated better
   performance in using basic procedures of geometry for practical utility;
   (3) both males and females demonstrated an enhanced transformation of
   the local mathematics into a corresponding global in relation to their
   domain-orientated activities; and (4) some other activities are found to
   be well (or equally)-orientated.},

Abstract = {In the present study, we describe a participating student's (Carol's)
   distributive partitioning scheme and operations along with Steffe's and
   his colleagues' studies about children's constructions of fraction
   knowledge as a particular model of mathematical learning. Analysis of
   Carol's mathematical behaviors indicates that an operationally common
   mathematical behavior (distributive partitioning operation) was revealed
   in various mathematical problem situations such as fraction
   multiplication, fraction division, and multiplicative transformation
   between fractional quantities. It both provides a rationale for why
   becoming versed in one mathematical subject could facilitate working
   with another mathematical subject and also implies the necessity of
   describing and defining students' mathematical behaviors from an
   operational view of knowledge, which might lead to building foundations
   of a substantial cognitive map for students' mathematical development.},

Abstract = {What does it take to change a school's mathematics achievement profile
   from low to one that is proficient and advanced? Is this transformed
   achievement profile sustainable? Such is the story presented here, in
   this three-phase case study of a K-8 urban charter school's mathematics
   program. The first phase discusses the school's mathematics program as
   it existed in 2006. The second phase discusses the contents and
   interventions implemented which transformed the student achievement
   scores over a period of 3 years (2006-2009) from low achieving to
   proficient and advanced. The third phase is a follow-up mixed-methods
   investigation that was conducted to determine whether the achievement
   was sustainable and how the program changed. The interventions designed
   and implemented over the initial 3-year period are discussed, as are the
   findings of the follow-up study. This is discussed with reference to
   impacting change in student achievement and its relative significance
   for future work.},

Abstract = {To investigate relationships between students' quantitative reasoning
   with fractions and their algebraic reasoning, a clinical interview study
   was conducted with 18 middle and high school students. The students were
   interviewed twice, once to explore their quantitative reasoning with
   fractions and once to explore their solutions of problems that required
   explicit use of unknowns to write equations. As a part of the larger
   study, the first author conducted a case study of a seventh grade
   student, Willa. Willa's fractional knowledge-specifically her reversible
   iterative fraction scheme and use of fractions as multipliers-influenced
   how she wrote equations to represent multiplicative relationships
   between two unknown quantities. The finding indicates that implicit use
   of powerful fractional knowledge can lead to more explicit use of
   structures and relationships in algebraic situations. Curricular and
   instructional implications are explored.},

Abstract = {Questions remain about how to best prepare students to be
   environmentally literate. Although Canada and U.S. share similarities in
   education systems, diversity in student population, and historical roots
   in formalizing environmental education, Canada is one of the top
   performing countries in international science assessments while U.S.
   matches average performing countries. This study examined the
   relationship of individual and school-related factors to environmental
   literacy by comparing students' performances in knowledge, awareness,
   attitudes, and behavior about environmental issues between U.S. and
   Canada using PISA 2006. Findings suggest that knowledge, awareness,
   attitudes, and behavior are inter-related, and development of certain
   domains of environmental literacy may be enhanced by classroom student
   investigations. Prior explanations for U.S. lower performance in
   environmental literacy cannot be attributed only to low socio-economic
   status and student diversity.},

Title = {USING A DISCIPLINARY DISCOURSE LENS TO EXPLORE HOW REPRESENTATIONS
   AFFORD MEANING MAKING IN A TYPICAL WAVE PHYSICS COURSE},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We carried out a case study in a wave physics course at a Swedish
   university in order to investigate the relations between the
   representations used in the lessons and the experience of meaning making
   in interview-discussions. The grounding of these interview-discussions
   also included obtaining a rich description of the lesson environment in
   terms of the communicative approaches used and the students' preferences
   for modes of representations that best enable meaning making. The
   background for this grounding was the first two lessons of a 5-week
   course on wave physics (70 students). The data collection for both the
   grounding and the principal research questions consisted of video
   recordings from the first two lessons: a student questionnaire of
   student preferences for representations (given before and after the
   course) and video-recorded interview-discussions with students (seven
   pairs and one on their own). The results characterize the use of
   communicative approaches, what modes of representation were used in the
   lectures, and the trend in what representations students' preferred for
   meaning making, all in order to illustrate how students engage with
   these representations with respect to their experienced meaning making.
   Interesting aspects that emerged from the study are discussed in terms
   of how representations do not, in themselves, necessarily enable a range
   of meaning making; that meaning making from representations is
   critically related to how the representations get situated in the
   learning environment; and how constellations of modes of disciplinary
   discourse may be necessary but not always sufficient. Finally,
   pedagogical comments and further research possibilities are presented.},

Abstract = {The study examines how students' conceptual understanding changes from
   high confidence with incorrect conceptions to high confidence with
   correct conceptions when reasoning about electromagnetics. The
   Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism test is weighted with
   students' self-rated confidence on each item in order to infer how
   strongly conceptions are held. The data (N = 118) are collected from an
   undergraduate static field theory course at a technical university in
   Finland. The data are analyzed using frequency distributions,
   correlation, and independent-samples t test. In overall, students'
   confidence grows along with the conceptual gains after instruction. The
   significant difference in the development of conceptual understanding
   between high-achieving and low-achieving students is found in the
   conceptual area of Newton's laws. Several strongly held alternative
   conceptions are also identified.},

Abstract = {In this study, the effect of 3 cognitive variables such as logical
   thinking, field dependence/field independence, and convergent/divergent
   thinking on some specific students' answers related to the particulate
   nature of matter was investigated by means of probabilistic models.
   Besides recording and tabulating the students' responses, a combination
   of binomial and multinomial logistic regression techniques was used to
   analyze the data. Thus, students' misconceptions as well as the
   compatible-with-the-scientific-view student's answers were explored one
   by one in relation to the above 3 cognitive variables. The study took
   place with the participation of 329 ninth-grade junior high school
   pupils (aged 14-15). The results showed that mostly logical thinking and
   sporadically the other 2 cognitive variables were significantly
   associated with students' answers. Interpretation of the results and
   implications for science education are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study, drawing on data from the Trends in International Mathematics
   and Science Study 2007, examined the predictive effects of multiple
   dimensions of mathematics and science self-concept-positive affect
   toward mathematics and science and self-perceived competence in
   mathematics and science-on mathematics and science achievement among
   1,752 first- and second-generation immigrant adolescent students in
   Canada. First- and second-generation immigrant adolescent students'
   self-perceived competence in mathematics had positive predictive effects
   on their mathematics and science achievement. In contrast, first- and
   second-generation immigrant adolescent students' positive affect toward
   mathematics had negative predictive effects on their mathematics and
   science achievement. While first- and second-generation immigrant
   adolescent students' self-perceived competence in science had no
   significant predictive effect on their mathematics achievement, it had a
   positive predictive effect on their science achievement. Positive affect
   toward science had positive predictive effects on second-generation
   immigrant adolescent students' mathematics and science achievement,
   whereas it had no significant predictive effects on first-generation
   immigrant adolescent students' mathematics and science achievement.
   Implications of the findings for policy and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {The skill-development model contends that achievements have an effect on
   academic self-confidences, while the self-enhancement model contends
   that self-confidences have an effect on achievements. Differential
   psychological processes underlying the 2 models across the domains of
   mathematics and science were posited and examined with structural
   equation modeling using the data of grade 8 students from the Trends in
   International Mathematics and Science Study across 28 countries (N =
   144,069), which generated 2 major findings. In statistical terms, (1)
   there were negative cross-domain paths leading from achievements to
   self-confidences, controlling for the positive matching domain paths, as
   predicted by the skill-development model across domains; (2) there were
   positive cross-domain paths leading from self-confidences to
   achievements, controlling for the positive matching domain paths, as
   predicted by the self-enhancement model across domains. There were,
   however, qualitative variations in the degrees of support for the 2
   models across countries.},

Abstract = {``Knowing and doing measurement{''} is a fundamental competency in real
   life since measuring attributes of objects in appropriate units and
   using measuring tools assist students to quantify and understand the
   world. For this reason, the study of measurement has a special place in
   every mathematics curriculum. Among the domains of measurement, length
   measurement is extremely important for students to understand basic
   ideas about measurement and to construct bases for more advance topics
   as area and volume measurement. However, research on students'
   understanding of length measurement reveals serious difficulties varying
   from incorrect alignment with a ruler to confusion of perimeter with
   area. One of the reasons for students' struggles in measurement is
   considered as weaknesses in the intended (written) curriculum. In this
   respect, this study was designed to investigate the content of length
   measurement in the Turkish mathematics curriculum (1st-fifth grade) in
   terms of its potential to support students' understanding. For this
   purpose, the Turkish Mathematics Curriculum Guide was carefully analyzed
   by considering main components of the curriculum (e.g. learning
   objectives). In spite of some weaknesses, the length measurement content
   in the curriculum seems to provide meaningful opportunities for students
   to develop the concepts and skills involved in length measurement.},

Abstract = {In order to cope with complex issues in the
   science-technology-environment-society context, one must develop
   students' high-order learning skills, such as question-asking ability
   (QAA), critical thinking, evaluative thinking, decision-making, and
   problem-solving capabilities within science education. In this study, we
   are concerned with evaluating the effect of student-teacher
   interaction-which is regulated by culture and traditions-on the QAA in
   science classroom in general and, specifically in our case, in chemistry
   laboratory classroom. We take Arab and Jewish sectors that are according
   to the literature different in their culture and tradition, as a model
   for our investigation. Specially developed and validated tools,
   including a novel practical test and an adapted article followed by a
   questionnaire for evaluating QAA, were administered to the research
   student population, and the responses were analyzed quantitatively.
   Observations were conducted in order to better understand the
   quantitative results that we got. Our findings indicate that there was a
   difference in the QAA between the 2 sectors. According to our findings,
   we assume that cultures, tradition, norms, social structure, modes of
   living, and related factors play a significant role as far as the
   development of students' QAA and apparently any intended attempt
   targeting the QAA paradigm shift must take into consideration the
   multicultural context within which it is to be implemented.},

Abstract = {The processes of curricula, textbooks and student resources development
   have been broadly surveyed and studied while teachers' guides have
   received comparatively little consideration throughout recent reforms in
   science education. Ideal curriculum materials align instruction with the
   goals of reform. Well-designed teachers' guides contribute to
   communicating and supporting reform-based teaching. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate the functions and assistance that guides
   provide science teachers. A questionnaire was developed and administered
   to science teachers from a stratified sample of elementary and junior
   high schools in Taiwan. The findings indicated that the guides were of
   greater benefit to elementary school science teachers than they were to
   junior high teachers. These groups of teachers perceived the guides'
   usefulness differently, but they believed that a clear, concise
   presentation of the purpose, reminders, answer keys, concept maps of the
   main topics and learning progression provided the most helpful and
   preferred layout. Teachers felt that the function of a teachers' guide
   is to provide teaching resources rather than to guide teacher thinking.
   This study discusses design suggestions that can engage teacher
   thinking.},

Title = {USING AN ENHANCED CONFLICT MAP IN THE CLASSROOM (PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT)

Abstract = {Researchers have shown that most students resist changes to their core
   beliefs by offering auxiliary hypotheses at the first sign of the
   development of conceptual change. Studies have viewed student reaction
   to discrepant events as an important clue in helping researchers
   understand not only the structure of alternative concepts (Niaz, Science
   \& Education, 7(2):107 - 127, 1998) but also the nature of scientific
   concepts. The main objectives of this research were the following: (a)
   to consider prudently the conflict map of Tsai (International Journal of
   Science Education, 22(3):285 - 302, 2000); (b) to initiate and develop
   an enhanced conflict map based on Lakatosian ethodology, which could
   help science teachers and students resolve conflicts that occur in the
   explanation of natural phenomena; (c) to examine the effectiveness of
   the enhanced conflict map; and (d) to discuss these implications in
   science education. Specifically, this study used two freshman classes
   from the Department of Electronics and one class of Astronomy majors
   from C. National University, South Korea, to investigate how scientific
   concepts change after selecting the modern physics field (Photoelectric
   effect), which is included in the Physics and Astronomy courses. Modern
   physics has led to the so-called Lakatosian heuristic principle or
   methodology, a useful framework that includes scientific philosophy and
   science history as study strategies. ``Enhanced conflict maps{''} are
   suggested for use to consistently show all the study processes.},

Abstract = {Public concerns about biotechnology have resulted in greater attention
   being paid to the mechanisms by which biotechnology is communicated with
   non-scientists, including the provision of science communication
   training. As undergraduate and postgraduate courses form the foundation
   of the biotechnology sector by providing a pipeline of university
   graduates entering into the profession, it has been proposed that formal
   science communication training be introduced at this early stage of
   career development. Using an Australian biotechnology degree course as a
   case study, this paper examines science communication training within
   this course and the views of past and present students towards this
   training. Interviews were undertaken with 22 stakeholders in the case,
   including undergraduate lecturers (who also supervise postgraduate
   research students), doctoral candidates and biotechnologists recently
   graduated from the course. Few of the students felt the course provided
   them with any form of science communication training, let alone training
   in how to engage non-scientists. Many were unaware of the training
   available to them and few of the lecturers were able to identify where
   communication skills are taught within the course. A previous study of
   this case has also shown that biotechnology undergraduates taking this
   course do not value communication with non-scientists. Clearly, the
   current state of science communication training for these students needs
   to be improved if they are to enter the biotechnology workforce as able
   civic scientists. The findings of this study may be useful for other
   university biotechnology courses which have yet to integrate science
   communication training into their curriculum.},

Abstract = {The relative positions of the sun, moon, and earth, their movements, and
   their relationships are abstract and difficult to understand
   astronomical concepts in elementary school science. This study proposes
   a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual reality (VR) model named the Sun and
   Moon System. This e-learning resource was designed by combining
   Microsoft Direct3D Library, C++ programming language, and Autodesk 3 Ds
   Max for constructing models. This learning environment provides a way
   for teachers to integrate information and technology into their science
   teaching. Furthermore, this study explored how teaching with the Sun and
   Moon System affected 128 Taiwanese fourth-grade students' science
   achievement. Four classes were randomly divided into comparison and
   treatment groups. The results show that: (a) students in the treatment
   group achieved significantly better grades than those in the comparison
   group under traditional class instruction and (b) the questionnaire
   results revealed that more than two thirds of the treatment group liked
   to use the 3-D VR model and would like to introduce it to their
   classmates. Based on these positive results, we are encouraged to
   develop more 3-D VR learning environments.},

Abstract = {The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has been
   developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
   to provide participating nations with internationally comparative mean
   literacy scores in reading, mathematics, and science for students
   nearing the end of compulsory schooling. The number of nations from the
   Americas that are participating in PISA has been increasing over the
   past 4 administrations. This 2-part paper (a) outlines the reaction to
   PISA within the media of both North and South America and (b) presents
   an Americas-specific example of the ways in which the PISA dataset can
   be used for more exploratory analysis through the lens of policy and
   curriculum suggestions, rather than just league table comparisons. We
   used multilevel modeling of scientific literacy predicted on a number of
   school-level background variables. Results point to the importance of
   socioeconomic background of the student as well as the school in
   predicting scientific literacy across all nations in the study; however,
   other school-level significant predictors were more nation-specific.
   Interpretations of these models as well as next steps are discussed.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to elicit students' understanding of the
   particulate nature of matter via a cross-age study ranging from
   secondary to tertiary educational levels. A questionnaire with five-item
   open-ended questions was administered to 166 students from the secondary
   to tertiary levels of education. In light of the findings, it can be
   deduced that the number of students' responses categorized under the
   ``sound understanding{''} category for each item increased with
   educational level, except for U1. Also, it can be concluded that
   students' specific misconceptions decreased steadily from SHS1 to SHS3,
   except for item 4, but there is surprisingly a clear increase at U1.},

Title = {Students' Sense of Belonging in Introductory Chemistry: Identifying Four
   Dimensions of Belonging via Grounded Theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 8},
Abstract = {Students' sense of belonging impacts their affect, motivation,
   well-being, and academic success. Sense of belonging is considered
   context-dependent as what determines one's belonging differs across
   contexts. This study explores how sense of belonging manifests among
   post-secondary, introductory chemistry students. This context is
   important given the threats to belonging that may arise from the
   transition into post-secondary studies and the pivotal role introductory
   courses play in student success. To carry out this investigation, 19
   post-secondary students from introductory chemistry courses were
   interviewed following a semi-structured approach. Qualitative analyses
   were conducted that led to a conceptualization of belonging. Belonging
   can be situational, dependent on the occurrences within the setting, or
   dispositional, representing long-standing tendencies. It is also
   acceptance-based, such as friendships and support, or value-based, where
   contributions are recognized or acted upon. These traits are combined
   into four dimensions: Situational Acceptance, Dispositional Acceptance,
   Situational Value, and Dispositional Value. This nuanced understanding
   can guide instructional and research efforts to improve students' sense
   of belonging.},

Title = {Using Notebooks to Explicitly Distinguish Multiple Perspectives in the
   Elementary Science Methods Course},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 21},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore an approach to an elementary
   science methods course that utilized a science notebook to physically
   distinguished multiple perspectives of science teaching and learning. We
   conceptualized teacher candidates' (TCs') thinking within a framework
   titled Exploring Multiple Perspectives in the Methods Course, focusing
   on a student perspective and a teacher perspective. We examined the
   pre/post drawings of a science teacher, which included reflections on
   the drawings, and end-of-semester focus group responses of 30 TCs from
   two sections of the methods course. Nineteen TCs either included
   notebooks in their post-drawings or indicated their value in their
   reflections. Focus group responses suggested the impact of taking the
   student perspective and the teacher perspective in the methods course.
   Furthermore, TCs discussed the notebook as a reference and reflection
   tool for students and teachers, as a tool for assessment and recording
   thinking, and notebook use as an elementary teacher. The findings of
   this study add to the literature by examining how TCs perceive and talk
   about using the science notebook when it serves as a tool to support
   explicit attention to student and teacher perspectives in the methods
   course.},

Title = {Current Trends in Math Anxiety Research: a Bibliometric Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 14},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate current trends in research of
   math anxiety (MA) through bibliometric perspective. Three main clusters
   were formed based on author keywords: cognitive correlates (working
   memory, attention, numerical cognition, mental arithmetic),
   psychological factors and effects (self-concept and self-efficacy,
   motivation, confidence, attitudes), and educational context (PISA,
   measurement, gender differences, math achievement, math education,
   assessment). Analysis of the index keywords revealed somewhat different
   organization with two dominant clusters: the experimental cluster in
   which the most frequent are psychophysiological measures and terms and
   the correlational cluster in which the topics of MA psychosocial factors
   are most represented. The map of bibliographic coupling showed several
   relatively separated groups of authors with different focus in cited
   references. However, a map of co-citation of authors revealed closeness
   of these separated groups, with Beilock, S. L. and Ashcraft, M. H. by
   far the most-cited authors in this field.},

Abstract = {This article presents a case study of two Grade 5 boys' argumentation
   concerning addition and subtraction of negative numbers while using an
   interactive tablet-based application simulating positive and negative
   tiles. We examine the properties of integers they conjectured, and the
   kinds of evidence and arguments they used to support their conjectures.
   The proof-based teaching theory used to develop the tasks, and the
   features of the virtual manipulative environment, are described. The
   results show that the tasks, in combination with the virtual
   manipulative environment, allowed the boys to perform calculations that
   they had not been able to perform previously, that in one instance one
   boy used a deductive argument to explain a conjecture they had made, and
   that a known weakness of the counterbalance model of integers that was
   used was not a problem in this case.},

Title = {Teaching Early Mathematical Skills to 3-to 7-Year-Old Children -
   Differences Related to Mathematical Skill Category, Children's Age Group

Abstract = {This study explored teaching early mathematical skills to 3- to
   7-year-old children in early childhood education and care (ECEC) and
   pre-primary education. Teachers in ECEC (N = 206) answered a web survey.
   The first aim was to determine whether teaching frequency or pedagogical
   awareness of teaching early mathematical skills varied according to the
   category of skills (numerical skills, spatial thinking skills and
   mathematical thinking and reasoning skills) and whether children's age
   group moderated these differences. The second aim was to explore to what
   extent teacher-related characteristics and children's age group
   explained variations in teaching frequency concerning early mathematical
   skills. Results from repeated MANOVAs demonstrated that the frequency
   and pedagogical awareness of teaching early mathematical skills depended
   on the skill category and that children's age group moderated these
   differences. In 5- to 6-year-olds and 6- to 7-year-olds, numerical
   skills were taught more often than spatial thinking skills, whereas in
   3- to 5-year-olds, they were taught as frequently. In all age groups,
   mathematical thinking and reasoning skills were taught the least.
   Pedagogical awareness was lowest in teaching spatial thinking skills in
   all age groups, but only in 6- to 7-year-olds was teachers' pedagogical
   awareness in teaching numerical skills higher than in the two other
   categories. According to a univariate analysis of variance, pedagogical
   awareness and mathematics professional development programmes were
   strongly associated with teaching frequency in all skill categories. The
   results emphasise that children's opportunities to learn early
   mathematical skills depend on teachers' characteristics.},

Abstract = {This epilogue for the special issue consists of brief reviews related to
   reading in language arts, science, and mathematics research areas;
   summaries of the nine contributions; themes arising from a cross-case
   comparison of the contributions; and further research, curriculum, and
   instructional considerations. The introduction and articles not only
   indicate the authors' thinking about reading as a stand-alone language
   art but also imply the paired language arts (i.e. reading-writing,
   representing-interpreting, talking-listening) and scientific and
   mathematical literacies. Seven themes emerged from these contributions:
   the influences from the nature of these disciplines, unique attributes
   that affect discipline-specific reading comprehension, movement toward
   international perspectives and languages, models of reading and
   comprehension, content teachers' responsibility for explicit strategy
   instruction and metacognition, data collection and analysis to reflect
   established frameworks for reading and other language arts in doing and
   learning science and mathematics, and professional learning and
   promising classroom practices. The concluding remarks provide
   suggestions for further research, classroom instruction, and
   professional development.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous setbacks in the different
   sectors of society until today (as of writing) including higher
   education institutions worldwide. Nevertheless, it also created
   opportunities to explore different aspects of pandemic prevention and
   preparedness. Specifically, this study attempted to explore predictors
   of COVID-19 pandemic preventive behavior including Views on the Nature
   of Science, belief on COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in the government
   among undergraduate students in one of the state universities in the
   Philippines. Following the survey research design, 389 undergraduate
   students answered a questionnaire whose items were adapted from
   literature. Data collected were analyzed through partial least
   squares-structural equation modeling using Smart PLS. The analysis
   allowed simultaneous assessment of measurement validity and reliability
   and hypotheses testing. Results showed that Views on the Nature of
   Science and belief on COVID-19 pandemic predicted COVID-19 pandemic
   preventive behavior. However, these two variables did not predict trust
   in the government nor did trust in the government predicted COVID-19
   pandemic preventive behavior. A reflection on socio-scientific issues
   and the role of Views on the Nature of Science, synergy of beliefs, and
   public trust, science, and COVID-19 pandemic preventive behavior are
   provided.},

Abstract = {This study explores the effects of gendered inquiry-based learning (IBL)
   practices on other science learning experiences and motivations
   including STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
   career aspirations. For this, PISA 2015 data representing the Finnish
   15-year-old student population has been selected and analyzed by
   multiple group structural equation modeling. According to the results,
   while girls and boys perceived a similar frequency of conducting IBL at
   school as a student, boys were more aware that students were allowed to
   conduct high autonomous IBL activities such as designing their own
   experiments. Also, boys expressed that they got more feedback from their
   teachers, and it was moderately related to the IBL engagement. Moreover,
   the result showed that while boys perceived more IBL experiences, the
   efficacy of the IBL activities was higher for girls since the
   relationship between IBL and science motivations was stronger for girls
   compared to boys. Lastly, this study found that a teacher was more prone
   to undervalue girls' science performance than boys during IBL. Based on
   the findings, this study argues that school IBL practices could be a
   good source for examining gender equity in science education. Also, the
   findings recommend gender-inclusive science practices at school in order
   to increase girls' interest in STEM careers and to enhance the effects
   of IBL on students' science achievement.},

Title = {Preservice Subject Teachers' Lack of Interest in Their Minor Subject: Is
   It a Problem?},

Abstract = {Interest in a particular subject is one central factor in preservice
   teachers' decision to become subject teachers. Interest in a subject can
   also become visible in preservice teachers' teaching and may
   consequently impact their students' interest in the subject. However,
   the interest of preservice teachers in their major and minor subjects
   has been scarcely addressed. In Finland, secondary school teachers
   usually study and teach two or three subjects. Major subjects are often
   chosen based on interest; however, the reasons for choosing a minor
   subject can vary. In this study, we examined the narratives of three
   preservice subject teachers regarding their interest in their minor and
   major subjects. They all studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry and
   revealed a much weaker interest in the minor subjects compared to the
   major subjects. Interestingly, our findings also reveal that preservice
   teachers' perceived strengths in a specific subject may not be as
   crucial to their interests, as has been suggested by prior research. We
   discuss the consequences of preservice teachers' weaker interest in
   certain subjects and provide recommendations for teacher education.},

Abstract = {We investigated the cognitive demand of the exercise problems that
   middle school students from Nepal are expected to complete. The middle
   school (grades 6, 7, and 8) mathematics textbooks examined in this study
   were published and distributed by the government of Nepal. Our data set
   consisted of textbooks that are currently in use in public schools of
   Nepal and used by majority of the middle school students in Nepal. Using
   the mathematical tasks framework to analyze the data, we found more than
   92\% tasks are of lower cognitive demands, and most tasks are at the
   level of procedures without connections. We also observed that the
   majority (more than 75\%) of exercise problems are supplemented with
   similar worked examples. We discuss implications and suggest future
   studies.},

Abstract = {Some of the online explainer videos for physics present misconceptions
   as scientifically correct explanations. Even so, some of these videos
   achieve good ratings on online platforms. A possible reason is that
   explainer videos with misconceptions foster an ``illusion of
   understanding{''}-the mistaken belief that a topic has been understood.
   Misconceptions close to everyday experiences might appear more
   attractive than scientifically correct explanations. This experimental
   study (N = 149 physics learners with a low prior knowledge on average,
   sample of convenience) was conducted to explore this effect. Two
   explainer videos were developed to be comparable in terms of
   comprehensibility and duration. The explanatory approach was the only
   difference between the two videos. While the experimental group watched
   a video introducing the concept of force using misconceptions, the
   control group watched a scientifically correct video. Learners from the
   experimental group developed an equal belief of understanding, but more
   misconceptions and fewer scientifically correct conceptions than those
   from the control group. We argue that this illusion of understanding
   might become problematic (a) in physics instruction because students who
   have watched a misleading video might regard further teaching in school
   as irrelevant, and (b) learners might tend to rate videos including
   misconceptions better on an online platform like YouTube. Future studies
   should examine these two possible consequences.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this qualitative interview-based study is to explore the
   experiences of female higher education students currently enrolled in
   math-intensive STEM majors in universities in Kazakhstan and identify
   the factors that determine their retention and success in STEM
   education. The lesson from this study is twofold: (1) one compelling
   reason for women underrepresentation in STEM in traditional contexts is
   the benevolent discrimination from all sorts of directions (faculty,
   male peers, and potential employers) resulting from dominant social
   stereotypes regarding women's occupation in STEM; (2) universities need
   to implement measures to overcome hidden biases and stereotypes to
   improve the retention of females in STEM.},

Abstract = {Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is
   regarded by many countries as fundamental to economic growth and as a
   result received continued attention. Scientist-teacher-student
   partnership (STSP) is one of the ways to make STEM education attractive
   and meaningful. However, research on the performance quality of STSP is
   scarce. Thus, this grounded model research aims to construct a model of
   performance quality STSP for STEM education. The research employed a
   sequential exploratory mixed method design which was carried out in two
   phases. In the first phase, data were collected through semi-structured
   interviews with 125 students, nine teachers, and ten scientists. Using
   the constant comparative data analysis technique, the grounded model of
   STSP emerged from the data which consisted of four main themes:
   collaboration factors, internal factors, institutional factors, and
   external factors. In the second phase, a quantitative survey was
   conducted with 267 science teachers to validate the grounded model of
   STSP. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling
   method with SmartPLS. The findings of the second phase study confirmed
   that the grounded model of STSP developed from the first phase can be
   applied to the wider sample of STEM teachers to enhance the performance
   quality of STSP in STEM education.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to provide data to better understand the
   processes of early mathematical modelling. According to this, an early
   mathematical modelling activity carried out by 21 Spanish schoolchildren
   aged 5-6 years is analysed, using the validated tool ``Rubric for the
   Evaluation of Mathematical Modelling Processes{''} (REMMP). The results
   show that children link the content of the problem with their prior
   knowledge (understanding); identify the important data of the problem
   and simplify it (structuring); show some difficulties in substituting
   the elements of the real context for mathematical objects
   (mathematizing); use progressively mathematical objects and strategies
   in order to propose solutions for the problem (working mathematically);
   compare the solution with the initial problem (interpretation); justify
   the proposed model via valid arguments (validation); and also
   communicate the decisions taken throughout the modelling process and the
   concrete model obtained applied to the real context (presenting). We
   conclude that the description of this type of activities and the tools
   for their analysis could be used for grading and teaching tool in order
   to promote mathematic modelling in early childhood education.},

Abstract = {The teachers should support students in acquiring knowledge and
   developing skills thus preparing them to think and learn independently.
   Considering this, the significance of implementing the modified
   Know-Want-Learn (KWL) teaching strategy, which directs students to
   perform metacognitive activities, becomes more evident.
   Quasi-experimental research was used to investigate the correlation
   between elementary school students' physics performance and
   metacognition regarding the use of a modified KWL strategy. The study
   included an experimental and control group and a pre-test and post-test
   research method. Two physics knowledge tests and a questionnaire on
   metacognition were distributed to the 110 sixth-grade students in the
   elementary school. Results indicated that statistically significant
   correlation existed between students' performance in physics and
   metacognition when the traditional teaching method was used. At the same
   time, there was no statistically significant correlation when a modified
   KWL strategy was used. It can be indicated that, while addressing the
   problem of poor students' performance, an improvement can be seen in
   case of the metacognition.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate how 22 preservice science
   teachers' (PSTs') beliefs about teaching socioscientific issues (SSI)
   changed after experiencing SSI instruction and reflection from both a
   learner's perspective and a teacher's perspective during a 12-week
   initial teacher education course. The study also explored the learning
   experiences associated with these changes. This study was conducted in
   Hong Kong, where the science, technology, society and environment (STSE)
   framework has been integrated into the secondary science curriculum but
   no SSI instruction is provided. Data were collected through learning
   tasks completed by the participants: (a) curriculum designs (pre-, mid-
   and post-course), (b) lesson plans (mid- and post-course) and (c) weekly
   reflective journals. Six profiles characterising teaching beliefs about
   SSI emerged from the data analysis. Qualitative analysis showed that the
   teaching beliefs of the PSTs had shifted from the traditional view that
   SSI should not be covered in science education to embracing SSI
   teaching. Three illustrative cases were used to capture key learning
   experiences and explore how these had led to a change in beliefs over
   time. These cases explained how PSTs' reflection on the why, what and
   how of teaching SSI to students can shape their beliefs about teaching
   SSI. The results have implications for the development of a closer
   alignment between PST beliefs and the SSI paradigm.},

Abstract = {Estimation supports the development of higher level mathematical
   thinking and reasoning; however, has received relatively little research
   attention. We examined whether making predictions influences the
   accuracy of numerosity estimates in elementary-aged children, and
   whether the amount of information available to the estimator determines
   the accuracy of their subsequent estimate. The study was conceptualized
   on the basis of five different conditions for estimating, based on the
   contention that estimates will become more accurate as additional
   information becomes available to the estimator. To test this idea, the
   study utilized two tasks to examine the responses of year 2 (grade 2)
   and year 6 (grade 6) students (n = 110) when using prediction-first and
   estimation-only strategies. Across both tasks, we found a direct linear
   relationship between the accuracy of students' estimates and the amount
   of information available. Moreover, there was some evidence that being
   given an opportunity to make an initial prediction improved the accuracy
   of final estimates; however, these conclusions were tempered by task and
   age. Overall, our findings support a strategy sophistication effect,
   whereby the amount of information available to the estimator, and the
   ability to use that information effectively, increases the accuracy of
   the estimate.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the quality of class talk
   during episodes corresponding to different levels of generalization. A
   total of 10 sessions in two classrooms in grade 7 were videotaped. A
   mixed approach was adopted to analyze the videotaped sessions. The
   findings show that triadic dialog was the dominant mode of interaction
   during class talk. The teacher's general teaching approach was inductive
   with a tendency to dialogic teaching, although there were some
   indicators to univocal class talk. This tendency to use dialogic
   teaching was due to shifts between generalization level episodes (at a
   macro level) and among knowledge types within episodes (at a micro
   level), which influenced the quality of class talk. Besides, the teacher
   played the role of secondary knower, thus allowing dialogic discourse
   during class talk. Furthermore, in almost all episodes, it was the
   teacher who initiated the episodes, and he frequently started the
   majority of exchanges. Triadic dialog in class talk and the multiplicity
   of teacher's roles, as initiator and secondary knower, helped to elicit
   various levels of generalization.},

Abstract = {Studies measuring teachers' beliefs quantitatively by using self-report
   Likert scale instruments often face methodological difficulties. Such
   difficulties might be due to the fact that those instruments often
   provide less or no contexts. Whereas, several studies have shown that
   contexts at school, particularly contexts related to students'
   abilities, may influence teachers' beliefs. To overcome such
   difficulties, we offer an approach by using rank-then-rate items instead
   of Likert scale items and by explicitly taking into account students'
   abilities within a questionnaire. In this study, we had 43 Indonesian
   teachers answering this questionnaire to investigate how students'
   abilities influence teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning of
   mathematics and problem solving as well as the interrelation between
   these beliefs with their beliefs about mathematics. The results suggest
   that teachers may elicit different beliefs about teaching and learning
   in the context of students' abilities. Furthermore, we found that
   teachers' beliefs about mathematics correlate with their beliefs about
   teaching and learning in the context of low ability students, but not in
   the context of high ability students.},

Abstract = {Our goal in this article is to organise an epistemological matrix for
   the concept of rational number that contemplates its different meanings.
   Aiming at understanding the various ways to signify the rational numbers
   and based on the theoretical-methodological approach of conceptual
   profiles, we produce and analyse data from various sources, including
   the sociocultural and ontogenetic domains, namely data extracted from
   secondary sources on the history of mathematics, mathematical analysis
   of subconstructs of rational numbers, analysis of textbooks for the
   middle and high school, as well as textbooks for higher education,
   research data on students' alternative conceptions, interviews with 3
   teacher educators and 4 in-service teachers from middle and high school.
   Such data allowed us, by means of an active interpretation of the
   researchers, to list 11 themes from which the rational numbers can be
   signified and to organise them into an epistemological matrix. Finally,
   we conduct a theoretical discussion that compares our epistemological
   matrix with an already quite widespread perspective in mathematics
   education, which is Kieren's subconstructs.},

Title = {Strategies Applied by Pre-service Elementary School Mathematics Teachers
   for Coping with Tasks that Require a Mental Rotation},

Abstract = {Despite the plethora of research in the field of mental rotation,
   researchers are still divided over a range of related issues,
   particularly the processes involved in coping with mental rotation
   tasks. This field of research, for the most part, is descriptive rather
   than interpretative, leading to the absence of a theoretical framework
   to enable the development of a coherent dedicated training program.
   Against this background, the present study is underpinned by the
   assumption that identifying relations between strategies that
   potentially lead to a successful coping with mental rotation tasks and
   those that do not lead to success might help us in designing a dedicated
   training program for pre-service teachers. The study involved 122
   pre-service elementary school mathematics teachers. They responded to a
   questionnaire that included, among others, two tasks that required
   performing mental rotation. In line with other studies, the results of
   the present study indicate that there is an advantage to implementing a
   holistic strategy over an analytic one. However, the mere implementation
   of a certain strategy does not guarantee that one would draw a correct
   conclusion, as the same strategy might lead to either correct or
   incorrect conclusion. Based on these results, we inferred that there is
   a mechanism that mediates between the strategy employed and the
   conclusion reached. Apparently, in the context of mental rotation, the
   study of strategies does not allow understanding the essence of this
   mechanism, and in order to construct an interpretative theory, an
   alternative course of inquiry is needed.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on developing the abilities of preservice secondary
   mathematics teachers to modify mathematical tasks through
   noticing-oriented activities. To this end, the study designs three
   phases for Noticing-Oriented Task Modification Activity (NOTMA) and
   applies it to preservice secondary mathematics teachers. It investigates
   characteristics of preservice teachers' noticing that emerged from NOTMA
   and analyzes their modified tasks in terms of their noticing. The
   results indicate that the development of preservice teachers' noticing
   is linked to their progressive understanding of the mathematical and
   pedagogical elements involved in tasks, and this improvement influences
   their task modification. Based on the results, we discuss that NOTMA can
   be useful to develop the task modification abilities of mathematics
   teachers and make some suggestions for the teacher training programmes.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the performance of 790 fourth graders from
   Taiwan for judging the reasonableness of a computational result by using
   corresponding methods pertaining to whole numbers. A number-sense
   web-based two-tier diagnostic test was used to assess the number-sense
   performance of the fourth graders who participated in this study. The
   results revealed unsatisfactory performance of study participants. Only
   25\% of them could apply the number-sense-based method to answer
   problems, and approximately 38\% of them had misconceptions regarding
   various items. This paper discusses several of these misconceptions, as
   well as the study implications and suggestions for future research.},

Abstract = {This study compares English- and Korean-speaking university students'
   colloquial and mathematical discourses on the notion and practice of
   limit. There exists a lexical discontinuity in Korean with the word
   limit, since the mathematical word for limit is not commonly used as a
   colloquial word in Korean, unlike its use in English. This study
   discusses similarities and differences with regard to ways students in
   each country use the word limit in colloquial contexts and in
   mathematical tasks. Data include surveys and interviews, and
   participants' discourses, which were analyzed using Sfard's (2008)
   discursive framework. Findings indicate that the mathematical discourse
   of the Korean speakers was structural (i.e. formal or mathematical) and
   the one for the English speakers was processual. Further, the
   differences between the US and Korean participants' use of limit in
   everyday and mathematical discourses informed the language-dependent
   properties of school mathematics discourses in terms of word use,
   routines, endorsed narratives, and visual mediators. This study
   discusses different discursive needslinguistically and culturallyto
   support meaningful mathematical discourses.},

Abstract = {Many efforts have been made to reach educational equity, especially to
   reduce mathematics and science achievement gaps by students'
   socioeconomic status. Across countries, educators strive to reform
   traditional teacher-centered instructional approaches to more
   student-centered/inquiry-based instruction to improve equity in
   education. In this context, this study examines whether relationships
   between socioeconomic status and scientific or mathematical literacy are
   moderated by student-centered instruction. Ten countries covering a wide
   range of achievement levels as well as equity in education are selected
   for an international comparison. A linear regression analysis is applied
   to student achievement, equity, and frequency of student-centered
   instruction data from the PISA 2012 and PISA 2015. We find mixed
   results: As student-centered instruction is offered more frequently, the
   gap in mathematical and scientific literacy between low and high
   socioeconomic status is generally narrowed or maintained. In most
   countries, students' mathematical and scientific literacy scores are
   expected to decrease across all socioeconomic status as student-centered
   instruction is given more frequently. The findings necessitate further
   scrutiny of how teachers implement student-centered instruction in
   various educational systems. This further research need to consider the
   complexity of implementation related to sociological and pedagogical
   aspects.},

Abstract = {Students in Shanghai ranked at the top in mathematics on the past two
   assessments of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).
   However, even though Asian students in general, and Chinese students in
   particular, ranked at the top in mathematics, we know little about
   Shanghai students' subjective well-being (SWB). This paper reports two
   studies that investigated the SWB of elementary and middle school
   students in Shanghai, as well as their mathematics performance. It is
   found that the mean scores of elementary school students on all scales
   of SWB are significantly higher than those of middle school students,
   representing a large drop for students when moving from elementary to
   middle school. Furthermore, students' mathematics performance is
   moderately correlated with their SWB. And for Grade 6, students' SWB
   affects their mathematics performance, especially from academic
   self-concept, attentiveness in the classroom, and relationship with
   teachers.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to survey and report on the empirical
   literature at the intersection of science education research in Latin
   American and previous studies addressing international research trends
   in this field. Reports on international trends in science education
   research indicate that authors from English-speaking countries are major
   contributors of publications. Despite the internationalization of the
   science education community, as represented by the publication of the
   work generated in non-English-speaking countries, research trends in
   science education in Latin America are uncommon in the literature.
   Therefore, it was deemed important to explore the scholarly productivity
   of science education researchers from Latin America to learn about the
   research orientations pursued by scholars from this region. Collective
   review findings are presented with respect to author's nationality,
   publication volume generated in each country, research type and topic,
   collaborative research, and areas for future research. Of the ten
   countries represented in this study, Brazilian authors were the most
   research active scholars followed by their colleagues from Venezuela,
   Mexico, and Argentina. The History, Philosophy and the Nature of Science
   (HPNOS) was the topic that most attracted the interest of Latin American
   science education researchers, and the Empirical Qualitative studies was
   the most frequent research type combination in the analyzed
   publications. Findings in this study suggest a relationship between
   investment power in Research and Development (R\&D) and the scholarly
   productivity not only in science education but also in the scientific
   field in the countries of the region.},

Title = {Reification in the Learning of Square Roots in a Ninth Grade Classroom:
   Combining Semiotic and Discursive Approaches},

Abstract = {This paper reports on combining semiotic and discursive approaches to
   reification in classroom interactions. It focuses on the discursive
   characteristics and semiotic processes involved in the teaching and
   learning of square roots in a ninth grade classroom in Japan. The
   purpose of this study is to characterize the development of mathematical
   discourses in a series of mathematics lessons in terms of the
   commognitive framework and the model of semiotic chaining. To achieve
   this objective, the notion of reification is revisited from cognitive,
   semiotic, and discursive points of view, and classroom activities are
   observed and analysed in terms of the combined theoretical framework.
   The results suggest that the model of semiotic chaining is not

Abstract = {Six US first-year university students in humanities or social science
   degree programmes were interviewed while solving 4 tasks on continuity
   and asymptotes in a required mathematics course. The focus was on how
   the students referred to the definitions or to the concept images when
   solving the tasks and if partial understandings appeared. Partial
   understanding denotes when the definition or the concept image has
   correct parts but essential parts are missing or incoherencies occur.
   Some students confused continuity with differentiability or perceived it
   as a graph not having holes, which is also reported by other studies.
   Another misconception that emerged is to perceive points on the x-axis
   as non-continuous. The partial understandings of asymptotes were related
   to the vertical asymptote as it was confused with a function property.
   Some students referred to the definitions when correctly solving some of
   the tasks and some students with coherent concept images were successful
   solving some of the tasks even when they did not refer to the
   definitions.},

Title = {Mathematics Teachers' Perceptions of Resources and Curriculum

Abstract = {This study explored similarities and differences in mathematics teaching
   and learning between public and private schools in post-apartheid South
   Africa. These conditions are viewed through the perceptions of
   mathematics teachers who navigate these two distinct spaces. This
   investigation was conducted during a cultural immersion component of a
   study abroad experience in Johannesburg, South Africa which targeted the
   examination of a township school in juxtaposition with a university
   sponsored magnet school. The study poses the question ``what are the
   perceptions of South African mathematics teachers regarding resources,
   student population and curriculum availability among neighboring
   schools?{''} Using critical theory as a framework to promote critical
   consciousness and to break down the institutional structures that
   continue to persist long after the apartheid, we employ the use of an
   exploratory case study to investigate these insights. Data was
   triangulated using the following methods; observations, interviews, and
   researcher reflections. As a result of our analysis, major themes in
   both settings emerged encompassing teachers' issues with time
   management, segregation of English as second language learners, and
   pressures felt by unreasonable expectations for mathematics curricula.
   This research will contribute to the field as implications for future
   investigation rest in the exploration of miscellany of mathematics
   curriculum among schools in South Africa.},

Abstract = {Misconceptions about climate change science are pervasive among the US
   public. This study investigated the possibility that these
   misconceptions may be reflective of science teachers' knowledge and
   teaching of climate change science. Florida and Puerto Rico secondary
   science teachers who claim to teach extensively about climate change
   were surveyed in regard to their conceptions of climate change science
   and the climate change-related topics they teach. Results show that many
   teachers hold naive views about climate change (e.g. that ozone layer
   depletion is a primary cause of climate change) and climate change
   science (e.g. that it must be based on controlled experiments for it to
   be valid). In addition, teachers in both groups neglect crucial topics
   such as how evidence for climate change is developed and the social,
   political, and economic dimensions of climate change. Our results
   suggest the need for teachers to understand how to teach climate change
   and the nature of climate change science using authentic contexts that
   promote effective socioscientific decision-making and climate change
   mitigation.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of structuring cooperative learning
   based on conceptual change approach on grade 9 students' understanding
   the concepts of mixtures and their motivation, compared with traditional
   instruction. Among six classes of a high school, two of them were
   randomly assigned to cooperative learning group where students were
   instructed by Cooperative Learning based on Conceptual Change (CLCC),
   the other two classes were randomly assigned to traditional learning
   group where students were instructed by Cooperative Learning based on
   Conceptual Change without well-structuring the basics of cooperative
   learning (CLCC(-)), and the remaining two classes were randomly assigned
   to control group where students were instructed by Traditional
   Instruction (TI). Mixtures Concept Test (MCT), motivation section of
   Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) except goal
   orientation sub-scales, and Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ) were
   assigned to the sampled students before treatments are commenced as
   pretests and after treatments are completed as post-tests. According to
   post-test scores, there were statistically significant mean differences
   among the groups exposed to variations of cooperative learning based on
   conceptual change and traditional instruction with respect to students'
   understanding the concepts of mixtures and their motivation. Results
   drawn upon this study revealed specifically that students exposed to
   CLCC had better understanding and lower alternative conceptions about
   the concepts of mixtures, perceived contents related to chemistry more
   valuable, felt greater control over their own learning, dealt better
   with sense of worry and emotionality during tests, adapted performance
   avoidance goals less, and mastery approach goals more than students
   instructed by CLCC(-) and TI.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether the 7 abilities found in a previous study
   carried out by the authors to constitute fraction understanding of sixth
   grade elementary school students determine hierarchical levels of
   fraction understanding. The 7 abilities were as follows: (a) fraction
   recognition, (b) definitions and mathematical explanations for
   fractions, (c) argumentations and justifications about fractions, (d)
   relative magnitude of fractions, (e) representations of fractions, (f)
   connections of fractions with decimals, percentages, and division, and
   (g) reflection during the solution of fraction problems. The sample
   comprised of 182 sixth grade students that were clustered into 3
   categories by means of latent class analysis: those of low fraction
   understanding, those of medium fraction understanding, and those of high
   fraction understanding. It was found that low fraction understanding
   students were sufficient in fraction recognition and relative magnitude
   of fractions, those belonging to the medium category in fraction
   recognition, relative magnitude of fractions, as well as in connections
   with decimals, percentages and division and representations of
   fractions, while high fraction understanding students were sufficient in
   all 7 abilities. It was also found that these levels were stable across
   time; the hierarchical levels were the same across three measurements
   that took place. Possible implications for fraction understanding are
   discussed, and directions for future research are drawn.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop and validate Science Homework Scale
   (SHS) which assesses middle-school (grades 6-8) students' perceptions of
   teachers' homework practices and homework self-regulation in science.
   Students' perceptions of teachers' homework practices included homework
   quality and feedback on homework while students' homework
   self-regulation consisted of homework goal orientations (i.e. mastery,
   performance, and work-avoidance), homework strategy use (i.e. deep
   learning and management), and homework procrastination; 3 studies were
   conducted with 7th-grade Turkish students. In study 1 (n = 618), the
   data were analyzed through exploratory factor analyses. In study 2 (n =
   758), in order to test the hypothesized factor structure, the data were
   subjected to confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). Goodness-of-fit
   indices indicated good model fit and Cronbach alpha reliabilities of
   subscales ranged from 0.77 to 0.96. Additionally, multi-group CFAs
   supported factorial invariance of SHS across boys and girls. In the 3rd
   study (n = 8318), CFA results supported 8-factor structure. Next, a
   homework model which suggested relationships among students' perceptions
   of teachers' homework practices, homework self-regulation, and
   achievement was proposed. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses
   results revealed that students' perceptions of homework quality and
   feedback on homework were associated with homework self-regulation
   components which in turn related to science achievement.},

Abstract = {The issues of metacognitive scaffolding in science education (MSiSE)
   have become increasingly popular and important. Differing from previous
   content reviews, this study proposes a series of quantitative
   computer-based analyses by integrating document co-citation analysis,
   social network analysis, and exploratory factor analysis to explore the
   intellectual structure of the MSiSE literature (i.e. the relationships
   within and between subfields of MSiSE). Co-citation refers to any two
   articles that are jointly referenced in other articles. After the
   computation of co-citation analysis, 27 articles that have been co-cited
   at least once by follow-up studies as references were identified as the
   final set of core articles. The whole co-citation profile of 27 cores
   with the 434 links was then visualized in a network through social
   network analysis, representing an overview for the intellectual
   structure of core MSiSE studies. The most cross-referenced underpinnings
   in the network focused on adaptive scaffolding for self-regulated
   learning to enhance students' conceptual understanding and on younger
   students' metacognition in online science inquiry learning environments.
   Furthermore, two emerging topics in the network were identified through
   an exploratory factor analysis as ``non-technological metacognitive
   scaffolding media,{''} and ``behavior patterns \& task analysis in
   technology-infused environments.{''} Overall, the study provides an
   innovative review method of scholarly communication in the MSiSE
   literature.},

Abstract = {This research study examines the development of the ability of
   pre-service teachers to notice signs of students' understanding of the
   derivative concept. It analyses preservice teachers' interpretations of
   written solutions to problems involving the derivative concept before
   and after participating in a teacher training module. The results
   indicate that the development of this skill is linked to pre-service
   teachers' progressive understanding of the mathematical elements that
   students use to solve problems. We have used these results to make some
   suggestions for teacher training programmes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the constructivist learning
   environment among Palestinian science students. The study also aimed to
   investigate the effects of gender and learning level of these students
   on their perceptions of the constructivist learning environment. Data
   were collected from 125 male and 101 female students from the faculty of
   science in Al-Quds University. In order to assess the constructivist
   learning environment, the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey
   (CLES) was used in this study; this version has five scales containing
   six items in each scale. In this study, CLES has been strongly supported
   by the factorial validity, and Cronbach's alpha reliability of the
   instrument was found to be 0.90. The study revealed that the mean of the
   items in the CLES was 3.8 based on a five-point Likert-type scale. The
   result of the present study suggests that there is a statistically
   significant gender difference in students' responses to the CLES, with
   female students' perceptions of the constructivist learning environment
   being more positive than those of their male counterparts.},

Title = {THE EFFECTS OF SOCIO-SCIENTIFIC INSTRUCTION ON PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS'
   SENSE OF EFFICACY FOR LEARNING AND TEACHING CONTROVERSIAL FAMILY HEALTH

Abstract = {This research investigates the effects of socioscientific instruction on
   pre-service teachers' sense of efficacy in the teaching and learning of
   controversial family health issues. For this purpose, a total of 251
   students from two teacher training colleges participated in the study
   and were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups. The
   experimental group was taught the contents of the controversial family
   health issues using socioscientific instruction approach and the control
   group was taught the same content using a more traditional approach.
   Quantitative data were obtained from both groups after responding to the
   `Teacher sense of Efficacy Scale' as instrument used for data collection
   before and after the treatments. Analysis of covariance was used in data
   analysis of which the pre-treatment scores were used as covariates.
   Qualitative interviews were conducted with ten participants randomly
   selected from the experimental group before and after the treatment to
   deepen and elaborate the quantitative data. The quantitative and
   qualitative findings indicate that the integration of the
   socioscientific instruction have significantly affected the pre-service
   teachers' sense of efficacy in favour of the experimental group that
   shows a more stronger sense of efficacy. It was concluded that the
   socioscientific instruction is significantly effective in changing the
   pre-service teachers' weaker sense of efficacy to a stronger one in the
   controversial family health issues.},

Abstract = {Beginning primary teachers' knowledge and beliefs were assessed at the
   end of teacher education and 4 years later. In addition, they reported
   about their school context and job satisfaction and took a video-based
   assessment on their perception, interpretation, and decision-making
   skills. Research questions were (1) whether we have to deal with a
   ``reality shock{''} in that beginning teachers' beliefs change to more
   traditional ones or whether their knowledge decreases, (2) whether the
   school context in terms of appraisal and a climate of trust influences
   the knowledge and belief development, and (3) to what extent the
   beginning teachers' knowledge and beliefs predict their perception,
   interpretation, and decision-making skills. Data from 231 German primary
   teachers in their third year in the profession neither revealed changes
   of beliefs towards traditional ones nor a substantial loss in knowledge.
   In contrast, general pedagogical knowledge (GPK) grew significantly and
   beliefs on the nature of mathematics were more dynamic 3 years after
   teacher education. Thus, drawbacks are a rare phenomenon in our sample.
   Those teachers who had perceived a stronger climate of trust revealed
   higher content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge and GPK as well
   as more dynamic beliefs. These teachers also revealed significantly
   stronger performance-related skills.},

Abstract = {In this study, we developed an instrument for assessing teachers'
   mathematics content knowledge (MCK) on ratio and proportion and examined
   the profile of Indonesian primary teacher's MCK on this topic. The MCK
   items were administered to 271 Indonesian in-service primary teachers
   with a variety of educational backgrounds and teaching experiences.
   Teachers' responses were analyzed by factor analysis and cluster
   analysis. The MCK instrument was found to have good acceptability in the
   reliability analysis with 3 factor components-meaning of proportional
   and non-proportional situations, number structures in situation, and
   figural representation-which was the main result of the study. With
   respect to the 3 factors, the teachers in the 3 assigned categories
   ({''}Good,{''} ``Middle,{''} or ``Low{''}) showed consistent performance
   on the items of the 3 factors. In particular, our results indicated that
   Indonesian in-service primary teachers had difficulty with the factor on
   figural representation, but they performed best on number structures in
   situation representing products of proportional reasoning.},

Abstract = {This study explored environmental worldviews of selected undergraduate
   students in Taiwan and located the associations of these worldviews with
   science. The ``environment{''} is represented as nature or the natural
   world, as opposed to the social and spiritual world. The participants
   were undergraduate students (14 science and 15 nonscience majors)
   enrolled in a general science course at a southern Taiwanese university.
   A questionnaire and individual interviews were conducted in parallel to
   elicit in depth the students' ideas/beliefs about nature, such as, to
   what construes nature, how it works, and how humans relate to nature.
   The responses were analyzed using a phenomenographic approach to
   emphasize the qualitative variation of the students' views. The key
   findings based on their relations to science and science education were
   the following: (1) Most students seemed to immediately relate the topic
   of nature to science and thus sought to explain nature from a scientific
   perspective, yet their understanding of scientific concepts or
   metaphors, such as the balance of nature, was problematic; (2) a
   value-free perspective is evident among some students in viewing
   human-induced natural crises: What we should do is merely look at facts
   and let science tell us what we should and should not do. (3) The
   students generally expressed trust in science and technology and
   believed it to be the key to improving the condition of nature as well
   as human life.},

Abstract = {The impact of a professional development experience involving scientists
   and fourth to eighth grade teachers of science was explored. Teachers
   attended a summer program at a research facility where they had various
   experiences such as job shadowing and interviewing scientists. They also
   participated in authentic inquiry investigations and planned inquiry
   units for their classrooms. Data on teachers' understanding and
   implementation of inquiry were collected through surveys,
   questionnaires, and classroom observations. Findings show that the
   teachers' understanding of inquiry improved and most participants were
   able to successfully implement inquiry science in their classrooms.
   Barriers to the implementation of inquiry practices and the impact of
   specific experiences with the scientists were explored.},

Title = {IMPACT OF A REPRESENTATIONAL APPROACH ON STUDENTS' REASONING AND

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore whether a representational approach
   could impact on the scores that measure students' understanding of
   mechanics and their ability to reason. The sample consisted of 24
   students who were undergraduate, preservice physics teachers in the
   State University of Malang, Indonesia. The students were asked to
   represent a claim, provide evidence for it, and then, after further
   representational manipulations, refinement, discussion, and critical
   thought, to reflect on and confirm or modify their original case. Data
   analysis was based on the pretest-posttest scores and students'
   responses to relevant phenomena during the course. The results showed
   that students' reasoning ability significantly improved with a d-effect
   size of 2.58 for the technical aspects and 2.51 for the conceptual
   validity aspects, with the average normalized gain being 0.62
   (upper-medium) for the two aspects. Students' conceptual understanding
   of mechanics significantly improved with a d-effect size of about 2.50
   and an average normalized gain of 0.63. Students' competence in
   mechanics shifted significantly from an under competent level to mastery
   level. This paper addresses statistically previously untested issues in
   learning mechanics through a representational approach and does this in
   a culture that is quite different from what has been researched so far
   using student-generated representational learning as a reasoning tool
   for understanding and reasoning.},

Abstract = {Because of their focus on psychological structures and operations,
   neo-Piagetian approaches to learning lend themselves to neurological
   hypotheses. Recent advances in neural imaging and educational technology
   now make it possible to test some of these claims. Here, we take a
   neo-Piagetian approach to mathematical learning in order to frame two
   studies involving the use of electroencephalography and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging imaging, as well as the use of iOS-based apps
   designed to elicit particular ways of operating with mathematics.
   Results could inform theories of mathematical learning and effective
   educational game design.},

Abstract = {This paper builds on results from a previous phenomenological study
   examining characteristics of influential facilitators of elementary
   mathematics professional development. The current study utilized a
   survey design where results from the qualitative investigation were
   quantitized to develop an instrument that allowed participants to
   identify qualities of facilitators that are necessary to motivate
   teachers to be engaged in professional development sessions related to
   mathematics at the elementary level. This paper describes the instrument
   development process and results when implemented to a sample of teachers
   in the USA (n = 565). Findings from this research indicate that
   participants share the same perceptions of what it means to be an
   influential facilitator as participants from the phenomenological
   investigation of facilitator characteristics.},

Title = {INQUIRING INTO MY SCIENCE TEACHING THROUGH ACTION RESEARCH: A CASE STUDY
   ON ONE PRE-SERVICE TEACHER'S INQUIRY-BASED SCIENCE TEACHING AND
   SELF-EFFICACY},

Abstract = {This case study reports the effects of a cooperative learning field
   experience on a pre-service teacher's views of inquiry-based science and
   her science teaching self-efficacy. Framed by an action research model,
   this study examined (a) the pre-service teacher's developing
   understanding of inquiry-based science teaching and learning throughout
   the planning and implementation phases of the field experience and (b)
   the pre-service teacher's inquiry-based science teaching self-efficacy
   beliefs prior to and after the field experience. The pre-service
   teacher's self-reflections before and after the field experience, video
   reflections, and results from the Personal Science Teaching Efficacy, a
   subscale on the Science Teaching Expectancy Belief Instrument-form B,
   were analyzed in this study. The findings revealed that (a) the
   pre-service teacher's understanding of inquiry-based science teaching
   and learning was developed and enhanced through the planning and
   teaching phases of the field experience and (b) the pre-service
   teacher's science teaching self-efficacy beliefs were improved as a
   result of a stronger appreciation and understanding of inquiry-based
   science teaching and learning. Further, the significance of this study
   suggests the use of cooperative inquiry-based field experiences and
   pre-service teacher action research by teacher education programs as
   means to deepening understanding of inquiry-based science instruction
   and increasing self-efficacy for such teaching.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we build on growing conversations centered around
   indigenous knowledge and its parity with various ways of knowing nature
   including traditional ecological knowledge, indigenous ways of living in
   nature, a Japanese way of knowing seigo-shizen, and Eurocentric
   sciences. We situate our discussion in Philippine postcolonial
   realities, where categorical boundaries are blurred, and any attempt to
   create culturally relevant preservice science teacher preparation will
   create confusions and tensions between/among/within abovementioned
   discourses. The Philippines is a highly colonized country-physically,
   for more than 300 hundred years, and mentally, after our colonizers have
   long gone. The marks of colonization are still present in our
   consciousness, in our current local knowledge, and in our ways of living
   with nature. In the attempt to create a ``third space{''} for culturally
   relevant science teacher preparation, tensions are highlighted and
   categorical boundaries are troubled. Where is science? Which one is
   indigenous or neo-indigenous? Which one is Filipino? Which one is
   foreign? Which one is ours? Which one is borrowed? These tensions and
   insights are highlighted through analysis of narratives drawn from
   interviews with and written outputs of prospective science teachers, as
   they attempted to make sense of the local knowledge of residents of a
   rural coastal village in the Philippines during Community Immersion, a
   community-centered, early field experience in science teacher
   preparation.},

Abstract = {The primary focus of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of
   games when used in tertiary-level mathematics classes in the United Arab
   Emirates. Our study incorporated a mixed-method approach that involved
   surveys (to assess students' perceptions of the learning environment and
   attitudes towards mathematics), interviews, observations of classes and
   narrative stories. A sample of 90 students from 3 tertiary-level
   institutions in Abu Dhabi participated in the study. In-depth
   qualitative data provided information about the introduction and use of
   games in mathematics. A narrative, based on classroom observations of
   students playing Jeopardy!-type mathematics games, provided insights
   into games in action in the classrooms. The data were analysed to
   examine students' interactions during the games and to triangulate,
   clarify and explain students' responses to the learning environment and
   attitude questionnaires. To examine pre-post differences in students
   perceptions of the learning environment and their attitudes, 2
   questionnaires were administered to students before and after the
   introduction of games. Pre-post differences for 3 of the 6 learning
   environment scales (Teacher Support, Involvement, Personal Relevance)
   and both attitude scales (Enjoyment of Mathematics Lessons and Academic
   Efficacy scales) were statistically significant. Information obtained
   from interviews with students and teachers were used to explain the
   pre-post differences.},

Abstract = {Typically, mathematics and science are seen as linked together, where
   both subjects involve numbers, critical thinking, and problem solving.
   Our study aims to develop a better understanding of the connections
   between student's achievement scores in mathematics and science, student
   gender, and self-efficacy. We used the Trends in International
   Mathematics and Science Study 2007 eighth grade data to answer our
   research questions and were able to demonstrate that when controlling
   for self-efficacy, there is a statistically significant difference in
   the achievement scores between males and females by subject, where
   females score higher Algebra, but males score higher in the other
   mathematics subjects. Likewise, we were also able to demonstrate that
   there is a statistically significant difference in the achievement
   scores in Earth Science, Physics, and Biology, between males and females
   where males score higher in science subjects. In both mathematics and
   science examinations, we controlled for self-efficacy where in
   mathematics females hold lower self-efficacy then males and in science
   there is no difference between females and males in terms of
   self-efficacy. We conjecture that mathematics and science classrooms
   that consider self-efficacy may impact student's achievement scores by
   subject, which can ultimately impact career choices in mathematics- and
   science-based fields.},

Title = {PROMOTING STUDENTS' CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF PLANT DEFENSE RESPONSES
   USING THE FIGHTING PLANT LEARNING UNIT (FPLU)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Most students think animals are more interesting than plants as a study
   topic believing that plants are inferior to animals because they are
   passive and unable to respond to external challenges, particularly
   biological invaders such as microorganisms and insect herbivores. The
   purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry-based learning unit, the
   Fighting Plant Learning Unit (FPLU), which focuses on plant defense
   responses to biological stimuli. The study also investigated students'
   perceptions of the FPLU implemented in a constructivist classroom. A
   total of 31 Thai science majors from grade 12 participated in this
   study. Multiple data-gathering techniques (quantitative and qualitative)
   were employed: conceptual testing, concept mapping, the Constructivist
   Learning Environment Survey questionnaire and semi-structured
   interviews. It was found that from their active participation, the
   students developed a better conceptual understanding of plant defense
   mechanisms. In addition, they appeared to have positive attitudes toward
   the FPLU as evidenced by their preference for inquiry-based teaching in
   a constructivist learning environment. Finally, their perspectives on
   and appreciation of plants as active organisms had been favorably
   changed by the experience.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop an instrument to measure
   school students' competence in learning science as part of a large
   research project in Taiwan. The instrument consisted of 29 self-report,
   Likert-type items divided into 2 scales: Competence in Scientific
   Inquiry and Competence in Communication. The Competence in Scientific
   Inquiry scale contained 4 subscales: presenting questions and
   hypothesis, planning, experimenting and data gathering, and data
   analyzing, interpreting, and concluding. The Competence in Communication
   scale contained 4 subscales: expressing, evaluating, responding, and
   negotiating. Students were recruited randomly from primary, junior, and
   senior high schools in different regions of Taiwan to validate the
   instrument and establish its reliability and validity. The results of
   the analyses indicate that the instrument, scales, and subscales have
   reasonable internal consistency; that the theoretical structure was
   supported by empirical data; and that the subscales are homogeneous.
   These results indicate that it is an appropriate tool for measuring
   students' competence in learning science. Implications and suggestions
   for further studies are included.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the potential impact of a national pilot initiative
   in England aimed at increasing and widening participation in advanced
   mathematical study through the creation of a new qualification for 16-
   to 18-year-olds. This proposed qualification pathway-Use of
   Mathematics-sits in parallel with long-established, traditional advanced
   level qualifications, what we call `traditional Mathematics' herein.
   Traditional Mathematics is typically required for entry to
   mathematically demanding undergraduate programmes. The structure,
   pedagogy and assessment of Use of Mathematics is designed to better
   prepare students in the application of mathematics, and its development
   has surfaced some of the tensions between academic/pure and
   vocational/applied mathematics. Here, we explore what Use of Mathematics
   offers, but we also consider some of the objections to its introduction
   in order to explore aspects of the knowledge politics of mathematics
   education. Our evaluation of this curriculum innovation raises important
   issues for the mathematics education community as countries seek to
   increase the numbers of people that are well prepared to apply
   mathematics in science and technology-based higher education courses and
   work places.},

Abstract = {Researchers, policy officials, and the wider public in Japan and abroad
   often hold different views about the quality of Japanese education.
   Whereas Western researchers are attracted by the academic performance of
   Japanese students in international assessment studies, Japanese
   university professors launched a public debate in 1999 about declining
   achievement. Both advocates and detractors, however, assume that
   students perform equally well or bad, teachers do not differ in their
   methods, and students are treated similarly across schools. This study
   explored the validity of the mutually opposing views about the quality
   of Japanese education and addressed the issue of unequal educational
   opportunities, which has not been investigated based on representative,
   large-scale datasets. According to the Programme for International
   Student Assessment (PISA) studies, Japanese students performed well but
   a decline is visible between 2003 and 2006 for mathematics. The PISA
   studies also indicate that an achievement gap exists in Japan and that
   tracking leads to differential school experiences.},

Abstract = {Learning and effective teaching are both complicated acts. However, many
   administrators, teachers, parents, and policymakers appear not to
   recognize those complexities and their significance for practice.
   Fueling this perception, recommendations from isolated research findings
   often neglect the complexities in learning and teaching, and when
   implemented in classrooms often fall well short of the advertised
   effect. Consequently, education research is generally ignored, and the
   resulting research-practice gap raises concerns regarding the utility of
   university-based teacher education, and education research more
   generally. However, the strength of education research resides in the
   synergy resulting from its integration into a unifying system that
   guides, but does not determine, decision-making. Dewey (1929) argued for
   teacher decision-making guided by education research, but recently
   several writers have justly criticized education researchers for not
   providing comprehensible assistance to educators and policymakers (Good,
   2007; Shymansky, 2006; Windschitl, 2005). This paper proposes a
   decision-making framework for teaching to help beginning and experienced
   teachers make sense of education research, come to understand crucial
   teacher decisions, and how those decisions interact to affect student
   learning. The proposed decision-making framework for teaching has
   significant utility in the design of science methods courses, science
   teacher education programs, effective student teacher supervision
   experiences, and professional development workshops.},

Abstract = {Within increasing pressure on young people to perform successfully in
   work, there is a growing concern regarding their levels of numeracy (and
   literacy). Whether such concerns are founded is the basis of this paper.
   This paper reports on the numeracy practices undertaken by three young
   boatbuilders who were nearing the completion of their 4-year
   apprenticeship. Using a method of stimulated recall and supplemented
   with interview data, the numeracy practices enacted by the boatbuilders
   was documented. It was found that the employees were highly competent in
   a number of areas-estimation, problem solving, holistic thinking and
   measuring (formal and informal). These skills are at variance with the
   basic skills being called for by public and government. It is proposed
   that the numeracy skills used by the employees may represent significant
   changes in workplaces being brought about through new technologies, and
   thus creating new and different numeracy demands from those of previous
   generations.},

   School Mathematics Teachers′ Knowledge of Students′ Misconceptions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 25},
Abstract = {The study assessed the relationship between career preparation, beliefs,
   attitudes, in-service training, and peer communication of primary school
   mathematics teachers and their knowledge of students ` misconceptions.
   Seven hundred one Chinese teachers were selected for the test and
   questionnaire survey. The mathematics teacher test paper had good
   reliability and content validity. The coefficient omega ( omega) and the
   confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to test the reliability and
   validity of the questionnaire items on mathematics teachers ` beliefs,
   attitudes, in-service training, and peer communication. The structural
   equation model (SEM) was used to explain the relationship between
   factors. SEM results showed that career preparation had no significant
   influence on mathematics teachers ` knowledge of students `
   misconceptions. Mathematics teachers ` attitudes towards students `
   misconceptions, student-centered beliefs, and peer communication
   positively influenced their knowledge of students' misconceptions.
   Furthermore, peer communication was the mediating variable between
   mathematics teachers' attitudes and knowledge of students `
   misconceptions, meanwhile between the student-centered beliefs and the
   knowledge of students ` misconceptions. These results of the study have
   indicated the direction for education departments and schools to improve
   teacher education courses and teacher activities in classroom practice.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Month = {2023 DEC 8},
Abstract = {In this qualitative study, we examined how prospective mathematics
   teachers' instructional visions align with their instructional practices
   through an approximation of practice opportunity. Namely, we employed
   scripting tasks to understand how prospective teachers complete a
   scripting task and respond to students' misconceptions, and we compared
   their instructional visions with their responding practices. The 81
   prospective mathematics teachers who were taking the ``Misconceptions in
   Mathematics Teaching{''} course at two different state universities
   comprised the participants. Data was obtained from the instructional
   vision questionnaire and two scripting tasks in fractions. We analyzed
   the data using the content analysis technique. Our findings indicate
   that the majority of the participants' instructional visions were
   aligned with ambitious instruction, while their responding practices
   were mostly inconsistent with their visions. Our findings suggest that
   while their instructional visions were highly reform based, prospective
   mathematics teachers still need to be oriented in an ambitious
   instructional direction in their practices.},

Abstract = {Questioning is a critical instructional strategy for teachers to support
   students' knowledge construction in inquiry-oriented science teaching.
   Existing literature has delineated the characteristics and functions of
   effective questioning strategies. However, attention has been primarily
   cast on the format of questioning like open-ended questions in prompting
   student interactions or class discourses, but not much on science
   content embedded in questions and how they guide students toward
   learning objectives. Insufficient attention has been cast on the
   connection between a chain of questions used by a teacher in the attempt
   to scaffold student conceptual understanding, especially when students
   encounter difficulties. Furthermore, existing methods of question
   analysis from massive information of class discourses are unwieldy for
   large-scale analysis. Science teacher education needs an instrument to
   assess a large sample of Pre-service Teachers' (PST) competencies of not
   only asking open-ended questions to solicit students' thoughts but also
   analyzing the information collected from students' responses and
   determining the logical of consecutive responses. This study presented
   such an instrument for analyzing patterns of 60 PST's questioning chains
   from when they taught a science lesson during a methods course and
   another lesson during student teaching. Cohen's Kappa was conducted to
   examine the inter-rater reliability of the coders. The PST's
   orientations from the two videos were determined and the correlation
   between them was compared to test the validity of this instrument.
   Consideration of the data from this instrument identified patterns of
   the PSTs' science teaching, discussed the importance of guiding
   questions in inquiry teaching, and suggested quantitative studies with
   this instrument.},

Abstract = {When justifying a mathematical statement, textbooks often interweave
   several instances of justification, creating, what we term, paths of
   justification. This study aims to characterize the paths of
   justification of mathematical statements that are offered in eight 7(th)
   grade Israeli mathematics textbooks. The study attended to context and
   compared paths of justification in different mathematical domains
   (algebra and geometry) and in textbooks intended for students with
   different achievement levels. Analysis focused on the number of
   instances of justification in a path, the types of justification of
   those instances, and their order. Comparing paths of justification
   between algebra and geometry, and between textbooks intended for
   students with different levels of achievements, revealed several
   similarities and differences. The findings portray a complex picture of
   textbook justifications, underlining the need to be sensitive to context
   when studying textbook justifications. The study results are discussed
   in light of relevant literature, highlighting potential factors involved
   in the way a textbook path of justification of a specific mathematical
   statement is structured.},

Title = {The Novelty Effect on Assessment Interventions: a Qualitative
   Replication Study of Oral Performance Assessment in Undergraduate

Abstract = {This paper reports on a qualitative replication study investigating the
   impact of the novelty effect on findings from interventions about the
   assessment of mathematics at university. The replication study used the
   same data collection tools of a previous study on oral assessment of
   mathematics, but data were collected in a context where oral assessment
   is the norm. We aimed to find whether the results of the two studies
   were comparable and whether there was plausible evidence of an impact of
   novelty effect on the findings of the original study. The findings of
   the current study appear to be comparable to those of the original
   study. Students associate oral assessment with the assessment of
   conceptual understanding and written assessment with the assessment of
   procedures; they report being more anxious about the oral assessment,
   but they perceive oral assessment as a better learning experience than
   closed book exams. However, in a culture where oral assessment is the
   norm, we found students engaging with learning also following
   considerations of the difficulties of other modules taken in the same
   period of their degree. Finally, in this culture, oral communication of
   mathematics is also much valued.},

Abstract = {This study is aimed to understand the connections between didacticians'
   meta-didactical praxeologies for the design and implementation of a
   teacher professional development program and their documentation work
   for the program itself. Didacticians are mathematics education
   researchers with the role of teacher educators. Data presents a case
   study, in which two didacticians (the authors) generate documents for
   the work with seventeen in-service mathematics teachers working at the
   lower secondary level, on inquiry mathematics tasks. The results reveal
   relationships, not yet fully addressed in research, between the
   intertwining evolution processes of the didacticians' meta-didactical
   praxeologies and their documentation work, nurtured by the collaboration
   with the teachers. The whole process is led by the evolving goal of the
   professional development program, from the promotion of the classroom
   implementation of inquiry mathematics tasks to the broader goal of
   building an inquiry community with the teachers. This study could
   contribute to the introduction of an interpretative model for the
   didacticians' work for the design and implementation of a teacher
   professional development program, based on the combination of
   Meta-Didactical Transposition and Documentational Approach to Didactics
   frameworks.},

Abstract = {The call for the implementation of integrated science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (iSTEM) teaching has been on the rise. This
   teaching approach helps students to develop innovative skills and meet
   twenty-first century challenges. However, teachers need to possess
   positive attitudes toward iSTEM teaching to implement it. Therefore,
   studying factors that influence these attitudes is important. So far,
   investigated factors have focused on teachers' personal and professional
   experiences. Predisposing and enabling factors related to iSTEM teaching
   are yet to be investigated. One putative construct that includes
   predisposing and enabling factors is adaptive expertise (AE) which
   allows professionals to highly perform in new tasks. Here, we argue that
   AE in science teaching is linked to teachers' iSTEM attitudes through
   its three dimensions: perceived relevance (PR), self-efficacy (SE), and
   anxiety (Anx). We utilized a cross-sectional survey method to verify the
   proposed relationship on fourth year preservice primary science teachers
   (n = 91). They completed two online surveys measuring AE in science
   teaching and iSTEM attitudes, respectively. Results from multivariate
   regression modeling indicate a significant positive effect of AE in
   science teaching was found significantly positive on all three
   dimensions of iSTEM attitudes. These findings draw teacher educators'
   attention to the importance of developing adaptive expertise while
   preparing iSTEM teaching advocates.},

Abstract = {STEM integration has attracted considerable attention in educational
   research, yet there has been a dearth of research exploring how STEM
   integration is perceived and implemented in regular school settings. The
   purposes of the study were to explore Taiwanese junior secondary
   teachers' conceptions of STEM integration with regard to their
   practices, investigate the ways STEM integration is implemented in the
   current school curricula, and analyze contextual supports and barriers
   to the implementations. This study adopted a qualitative research
   design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 in-service
   teachers who delivered integrated STEM in their classrooms. The
   teachers' conceptions and contextual factors were analyzed using the
   constant comparison method, whereas the implementations were examined by
   the two-dimensional spectral framework proposed in the study:
   disciplinarity and pedagogy. Three categories of teacher conceptions
   were identified that highlighted how STEM can bring different learning
   experiences to students. The implementations varied in the degree of
   disciplinary integration and the extent to which teacher guidance was
   provided. While school conditions and wider educational contexts posed
   challenges to STEM integration and implementation, school professional
   support plays a key role in facilitating integration and teaching across
   disciplines. This study provides insights into how teachers reconcile
   their conceptions with school conditions and educational contexts to
   implement STEM integration in regular classrooms. The two-dimensional
   framework remarks the values of diversity, namely, to appreciate the
   learning possibilities opened by varied integration approaches, promote
   diverse learning outcomes, and allow adaptations based on school
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Measurement estimation skills are relevant for our everyday life and
   should be addressed in the mathematics classroom. Although students'
   measurement estimation skills were examined in several empirical
   studies, a structure model to describe these skills is still missing.
   The current research aimed at analyzing the structure of length
   estimation skills as one basic measurement estimation skill. Taking into
   account the different kinds of estimation situations, a test on length
   estimation skills was developed and administered in two contrasting
   samples of 3rd- and 4th-grade students from Germany and Taiwan in two
   studies. Study 1 (N = 248) followed an exploratory approach to analyze
   the structure of length estimation skills (research question 1).
   Exploratory factor analysis suggested a 3-dimensional model of length
   estimation skills, dividing the dimensions (1) estimating lengths of
   small objects, (2) estimating lengths of objects that are not small but
   touchable, and (3) estimating lengths of objects that are not small and
   not touchable. This 3-dimensional structure could be confirmed using
   confirmatory factor analyses in study 2 (N = 903). In addition, the test
   on students' length estimation skills proved to be partially measurement
   invariant across the two groups (research question 2). The
   cross-national comparison (research question 3) revealed differences
   between Taiwanese and German students' length estimation skills that
   correspond to the educational traditions in each country. Taiwanese
   students reached better results on the dimensions small as well as not
   small and touchable while German students were ahead in the dimension
   not small and not touchable.},

Title = {Undergraduate Students' Use of Primitive Notions When Reasoning About

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that students form fragmented understandings
   about variability even after instruction and that these primitive
   notions function as obstacles to a robust understanding of variability.
   To investigate the effect of disruptions to students' primitive notions
   of variability, we examined undergraduate students' reasoning about
   variability when distributions of quantitative datasets to be compared
   (a) have equal ranges, (b) do not include extreme values, and (c) have
   approximately the same number of different values. We designed homework
   questions and collected student responses to these questions from a
   large number of students attending an introductory statistics course. We
   also reorganized these questions into interview tasks and conducted
   task-based interviews with students. The results showed that students
   either did not address variability in these narrowly framed situations
   or provided limited, ambiguous, or inconsistent responses. The findings
   suggest that students typically think about variability in terms of
   range's colloquial meaning and how different the values are from each
   other. Students' reasoning was often contingent upon the particular and
   more prevalent characteristics of the distributions on which they were
   asked to work. Future work should explicate ways to utilize students'
   available conceptions of variability in teaching the concept's normative
   meaning.},

Abstract = {This study examined the relationship between mathematics achievement and
   epistemic actions. Cognitive actions that are observed as outcomes of
   using intellectual resources are referred to as epistemic actions in
   this study. We focused on four epistemic actions as follows: selecting,
   analyzing, computing, and representing, which are theoretically
   important to understand mathematical practices and required to solve
   test items. We sequentially applied the generalized DINA (generalized
   deterministic inputs, noisy ``and{''} gate) and linear regression to the
   Iowa Assessments data from grades 6 to 8. The findings showed that
   mastery of the epistemic actions contributed to the improvement of
   mathematics achievement individually as well as collectively. The
   actions of selecting and computing contributed to higher mathematics
   achievement across grades 6 to 8, while the development of representing
   improved mathematics achievement, though to a lesser degree. Students
   with all four epistemic actions had considerably higher mathematics
   achievement compared to their peers with other possible combinations of
   selecting, analyzing, computing, and representing. We also found
   learning loss because of the transition from elementary school to middle
   school. The findings suggested that students need to be offered more
   opportunities to experience these epistemic actions collectively with
   greater instructional emphasis on analyzing patterns and selecting
   strategies to find correct answers. However, when students have
   difficulties in the development of epistemic actions, teachers can have
   different emphasis on representing in elementary schools, selecting and
   analyzing in middle schools, and computing through elementary and middle
   schools.},

Abstract = {We investigated and compared sociomathematical norms in secondary
   mathematics teachers' classrooms before and after using mathematical
   modeling activities. Participants were four secondary mathematics
   teachers. The data included 104 h of videotaped classroom observations
   and teacher interviews. The data analysis revealed notable changes in
   sociomathematical norms in teachers' lectures not utilizing modeling
   activities beyond those utilizing modeling activities. The results
   implied that teachers and students were convinced by and adopted what
   was done in the modeling environment. We discussed that modeling
   activities could be a powerful tool for mathematics teachers and
   students in challenging and transforming traditionally oriented
   classroom norms to those aligned with reform-oriented mathematical
   classrooms and their sustainability.},

Abstract = {There has been an ongoing discussion about the role and level of teacher
   scaffolding in developing student agency while also meeting intended
   learning outcomes in inquiry-based science classrooms. This study
   investigates how teachers practice classroom talk to scaffold students'
   learning through the inquiry process and how teacher authority and
   student agency are embedded in a dialogical practice. A case study using
   an ethnographic approach was employed to understand the complexity of
   teachers' and students' interactions through classroom talk. Two
   elementary teachers and their students were involved in this study.
   Through classroom talk, the teachers demonstrated openness and
   flexibility in their dialogical turns to develop students' agency in
   problem solving, while at the same time employed their authority to
   monitor and lead classroom talk toward students' understanding of
   science concepts as part of the intended curriculum. They sought to
   emphasize scientific attitudes in the inquiry process by acknowledging
   the authority of science and scientists' ways of problem solving.
   Accordingly, this study found that the teachers alternated between
   dialogical and authoritative voices in classroom talk to facilitate
   student learning with agency. Furthermore, this study suggests the
   importance of distinguishing teacher pedagogical authority from teacher
   authority as power dominance.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a partnership between a university and an urban
   school district, formed with a goal of preparing mathematics teacher
   leaders to conduct professional development (PD) at their schools. The
   university and district partners worked together to achieve the
   district's mission of providing every student with high-quality
   instruction and equitable learning opportunities in mathematics by
   building the district's capacity to conduct school-based PD for
   mathematics teachers. Given the power of school-based subject-specific
   PD for improving instructional quality, we worked with Teacher Leaders
   from participating schools to prepare and support them to lead PD
   workshops at their schools. In this paper, we examine how Teacher
   Leaders learn and adapt key elements of a PD model over three school
   years through the lenses of Prediger et al.'s Three-Tetrahedron-Model
   (2019) and the university's Learning to Lead model. Over 3 years, we see
   that Teacher Leaders use the key structures of the PD model; make
   adaptations in response to school goals, interests, and priorities; and
   gain confidence in their work with colleagues. By viewing the
   adaptations through the lens of pedagogies of practice as well as the
   relationships illustrated by the 3-T model, this work offers insights
   into the complexities of teacher leadership development.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to examine mathematical creativity in students'
   work in geometry. Research conducted was based on two aspects: (a)
   examining the influence of geometrical figure apprehension on the
   production of multiple solutions and (b) how the necessity to construct
   auxiliary lines in the given shape promotes the production of multiple
   solutions and the variables of creativity. Data was collected from 243
   tenth graders (15 and 16 years old); all participants were asked to
   complete a 2-part test, a multiple solution problem solving test, and a
   geometrical figure apprehension test. The analysis of the results
   primarily shows that the way through which students perceive the
   geometrical figure and their ability to process it, is an important
   factor in predicting their mathematical creativity. Furthermore, it
   became evident that only perceptual apprehension of geometrical figures
   is not a reliable predictor of creativity variables, as opposed to
   operative apprehension of geometrical figures that positively predict
   the characteristics of creativity: fluency, flexibility, and
   originality.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to discuss preservice mathematics teachers'
   in-the-moment noticing of mathematical opportunities and how they
   reflected on those opportunities both orally and in writing. A
   faculty-school collaboration program was set up to enable preservice
   teachers to work with students in a school setting throughout a year.
   Ten preservice teachers participated in the study. Videotapes and
   written documents were major tools to collect data, and a coding
   framework was used to describe and pursue the pattern in preservice
   teachers' noticing skills. The results revealed that preservice teachers
   were able to notice mathematical opportunities occurring in class both
   in the moment of and after implementation of mathematical tasks.
   Although their responding actions during implementation were mostly in
   the form of orienting students to correct solutions, they attempted to
   enrich students' mathematical interpretations by providing
   justifications from the students' work in their oral and written
   reflections.},

Abstract = {Despite underrepresentation patterns in women minorities in STEM fields,
   a growing number are completing degrees. Exploring factors which serve
   as contributors to success in science are critical to broaden
   participation. STEM college faculty can serve as key contributors to the
   success of these students and exploring ways that faculty support their
   students is important. This study aimed to understand ways that science
   faculty from a Northeast University believed they supported
   underrepresented students. Utilizing semi-structured interviews, six
   faculty and one advisor identified the critical factors that fostered
   success in their students. Using thematic analysis, key themes included
   the value of advising, mentoring, and networking; the importance of a
   supportive inviting environment; and targeted support programs as the
   salient factors. These factors align with current research but suggest
   that many college science faculty are not providing these resources for
   their students. While only a small sample, this study adds to the scant
   literature exploring how faculty provide support for underrepresented
   students in science.},

Abstract = {Results of international comparison studies show substantially better
   mathematics performance of the investigated Asian than European students
   from the early years on. A Taiwanese-German Research Program (TaiGer)
   engages in exploring differences and similarities in the educational
   system, in teachers' knowledge and beliefs and in teaching or learning
   practice in Taiwan and Germany. Embedded in this Research Program, this
   contribution focuses on early mathematics education. As mathematics is
   often seen as an internationally more or less homogeneous discipline, it
   could be assumed that differences in the educational outcomes could be
   explained by, e.g. cultural-societal factors, curriculum or instruction
   practice. This contribution gives an overview about results of studies
   analyzing the differences between children's mathematical performance in
   Asia and Europe or America with a focus on early childhood education.
   For a sound comparison between countries aiming to analyze if cultural
   differences or other aspects (e.g. teaching practice or structural
   differences) are responsible for differences, basic conditions
   concerning teaching and learning should be controlled. At first sight,
   it could be recognized that, next to the cultural background, Germany
   and Taiwan differ extremely in basic frame conditions (e.g. preservice
   training) concerning early mathematics education. For this reason, this
   contribution analyzed if, with a third well-considered European country,
   a comparative design for ongoing research could be possible, where
   pairwise similarities allow to clarify relations between differences in
   early mathematics education and the cultural background on the one hand
   and early mathematics education and institutional frame conditions or
   the teachers' professional knowledge on the other hand.},

Abstract = {STEAM education evolved to address the critical demand for creative
   transdisciplinary teaching that was under-realized in STEM programs.
   However, this novel concept has not been clearly conceptualized; this is
   likely attributed to the lack of a grounding theory to frame STEAM. We
   propose using connected learning theory to examine a previously
   developed STEAM conceptual model. This work explores the potential of
   connected learning theory to understand specific STEAM instructional
   practices. Using observations of 43 middle-grade teachers from 14
   schools enacting STEAM practices in their classrooms, we examined what
   connected learning looked like in STEAM classrooms and how the STEAM
   conceptual model could be enhanced by analyzing implementation practices
   through the principles of connected learning. The qualitative data
   analysis of observations, video recorded data, and debriefing sessions
   with teachers after the observations included two rounds of analysis.
   This found significant overlap in ideas of connected learning and STEAM,
   notably a shared emphasis on design, collaboration, and contextualized
   learning.},

Abstract = {In the sciences, energy is an important idea to get insight into
   phenomena, as energy can help to reveal hidden systems and processes.
   However, students commonly struggle to use energy ideas to interpret and
   explain phenomena. To support students in using energy ideas to
   interpret and explain phenomena, a range of different graphical
   representations are commonly used. However, there is little empirical
   research regarding whether and how these representations actually
   support students' ability to use energy ideas. Building on common ways
   of representing energy transfer, we address this issue by exploring
   whether, and if so how, a specific representation called the energy
   transfer model (ETM) supports middle school students' interpretation of
   phenomena using the idea of energy transfer. We conducted an interview
   study with N = 30 8th grade students in a quasi-experimental setting and
   used qualitative content analysis to investigate student answers. We
   found evidence that students who construct an ETM when making sense of
   phenomena consider the role of energy transfers between systems more
   comprehensively, i.e., they reason about hidden processes and systems to
   a larger extent than students who do not construct an ETM.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the number of science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM) specialized schools has been rapidly increasing
   internationally. In the United States, a new movement of establishing
   inclusive STEM high schools (ISHSs) aimed at expanding access to
   specialized STEM education for underrepresented and diverse student
   groups has begun to emerge. Due to its recent emergence, rigorous
   evidence on the impact of ISHSs on student outcomes is scarce and
   inconclusive. This study adds to this limited but growing body of
   empirical literature by examining whether ISHSs have an effect on
   student achievement, course-taking, and high school completion, and if
   effects vary by sociodemographic subgroups. Focusing on the Texas STEM
   academies-the largest cluster of ISHSs in the US, and analyzing a
   decade-long data from the Texas Statewide Longitudinal Data System,
   pooled regression analysis results showed that while ISHSs had no impact
   on student test scores in mathematics and science, the effects are
   positive on completing advanced level math courses in high school.
   Subgroup analyses indicated that ISHSs generally have no differential
   effects on student outcomes by sociodemographic subgroups, with the
   exception that they improve the rates of high school graduation for
   racial minority and low-income students.},

Abstract = {Integrated STEM education leverages interconnections between science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics in order to reflect upon how
   each discipline operates within real world contexts. Students benefit
   from the integrated STEM approach because it values the real-life
   experiences of students along with the hands-on applications that mirror
   professional STEM work. Nevertheless, integrated STEM instruction
   remains ill-defined with many gaps evident in the existing research of
   how implementation explicitly works. The school setting central to this
   case study was a suburban public middle school that had sustained an
   integrated STEM program for a period of over 5 years. Through the use of
   phenomenological qualitative inquiry, we focused on both teachers' and
   students' experiences of participation in one integrated STEM model.
   Three major themes emerged as part of this inquiry. First, teachers
   engaged in continual reflection that along with district supports
   contributed to the durability of the model. Second, teachers and student
   engaged in dynamic learning transactions based on the particular task
   and concept covered. Third, science projects anchored learning
   opportunities deemed most successful by participants.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of design-based science (DBS)
   instruction on students' learning of electrical energy and students'
   metacognitive strategy use in science. Two classes of seventh-grade
   students participated in the study. DBS instruction was used in the
   treatment group, while the comparison group was taught the unit with
   curriculum-oriented science instruction (COSI). Mixed between/within
   subjects, ANOVA results suggest that at the beginning of the study,
   there was no difference between the treatment and comparison groups in
   terms of electrical energy learning or metacognitive self-regulation. At
   the end of the study, students in the DBS group outperformed students in
   the COSI group in electrical energy learning. Students in both groups
   had increased understanding of electrical energy; however, the
   improvement levels were much higher in the DBS group than in the COSI
   group. At the end of the study, the DBS group also reported higher
   levels of monitoring strategy use than the COSI group, while there was
   no difference between the groups in terms of planning and regulation
   strategies. Furthermore, the DBS group showed improvement in all
   metacognitive learning strategy components, whereas no change was
   detected in the COSI group. Thus, it seems that DBS contributed to
   students' learning in electrical energy and enhanced their metacognitive
   self-regulation in science more than COSI. Additionally, students in the
   DBS group generally thought positively about the influences of DBS
   instruction on their science learning. They identified similarities
   between DBS processes and activities engineers use in real life.},

Abstract = {This study explored how a 2-year, maker-centered science, technology,

   curriculum aimed at leading students to be makers changed students,
   science teachers, and a rural middle school in Taiwan, where teachers
   were stressed due to the low birth rate and low grades in the
   Comprehensive Assessment Program for Junior High School Students (CAP).
   This practical action research study utilized data collected from 24
   students in a maker class, their peers, 4 teachers, and administrative
   documents related to school enrollment and student competitions'
   records. Results showed that teachers had shifted their teaching from
   being teacher-centered to student-centered. The students who
   participated in the M-STEM-PjBL curriculum actively assisted peer
   learning and initiated active teacher-student interactions. Both teacher
   and student participants improved their practical skills during the
   process. Students in the maker science class had more positive attitudes
   toward science and science learning and changed their peers' attitudes
   in the regular science class. The problematic rate of not meeting the
   required standard in the science subtest of the CAP was reduced from 36
   to 26\%. Moreover, student participants' products recommended to the
   county or national level competitions frequently won awards. Student
   participants' creativity and the science teachers' teaching efforts were
   recognized in the media. Parent endorsement of the school was increased,
   the threat of losing students to other schools was decreased, and the
   crisis of cutting the number of classes was reduced.},

Abstract = {Working with scientists has been suggested as an effective way for high
   school students to learn science more authentically. However, several
   challenges hinder partnerships between students and scientists, such as
   intimidation issues, the complexity of scientific language, and
   communication barriers. The purpose of this phenomenographic study was
   to introduce a pedagogical tool, cogenerative dialogs (cogens), to
   improve student-scientist partnerships and to investigate high school
   students' experience of cogens with scientists. The analysis of high
   school students' and scientists' experiences of cogens in this study
   suggested four positive and two challenging experiences that shed light
   on the use of cogens by two distinctly different groups of stakeholders.
   This study demonstrates positive evidence that cogens can help students
   build a stronger bond with scientists to enhance their science learning.
   Suggestions to improve cogen practices between students and scientists
   are provided.},

Abstract = {Teachers have a crucial role to play in raising future generations of
   citizens who are aware of issues in genetics literacy such as gene
   therapy, cloning, and stem cell research. Teachers' teaching practices
   are influenced by their knowledge in genetics literacy and their
   attitudes towards different issues. Accordingly, this study explored the
   relationships among middle school science teachers' background
   characteristics (gender, teaching experience, self-perceived interest in
   and self-perceived knowledge of genetics), their genetics literacy
   levels, their attitudes towards various issues in genetics literacy, and
   their perceptions of teaching issues in genetics literacy. Data were
   collected from 435 Turkish middle school science teachers by completing
   the Genetics Literacy Assessment Inventory, the scale for attitudes
   towards issues in genetics literacy and perceptions of teaching issues
   in genetics literacy. The results of canonical correlation analysis
   suggested that being female, having a high level of interest in
   genetics, and perceiving oneself as knowledgeable in genetics were
   associated with higher levels of knowledge in genetics literacy and
   holding favorable general attitudes. These teachers believed in the
   necessity of introducing genetics literacy and held higher self-efficacy
   teaching beliefs regarding the teaching of issues in genetics literacy
   in their classes. However, they tended to emphasize more impeding
   factors as well as hold unfavorable attitudes towards gene therapy and
   gene therapy applications, implying that their attitudes were context
   dependent.},

Abstract = {This study begins the task of mapping out two approaches that may be
   helpful in overcoming incorrect responses to conservation tasks,
   focusing on the non-conserved quantity. The incorrect responses, which
   were the result of over-generalizations of conservation, and gradually
   increased with age despite formal knowledge and minor perceptual input,
   were explained as being consistent with the intuitive rule same A-same
   B. The following paper presents initial findings, involving 60 students
   (5th, 7th, 9th grade), who were presented with authentic tasks and 40
   9th grade students who were presented with extreme tasks. As data show,
   in both authentic tasks and extreme tasks, the percentage of
   participants' correct responses was higher compared to students'
   responses to formal analogue tasks, although there was no difference in
   participants' declarative judgments. Indeed, further research is needed
   to improve students' responses and judgments not only in analogous and
   everyday tasks but also on how learning tasks can be designed, and to
   understand the observed gap between the students' performance and their
   declarative knowledge.},

Abstract = {The results of international large-scale assessments have shown that
   countries vary considerably in their mathematics performance. Culture
   has been suggested as a possible cause for the national difference, but
   insufficient empirical research has been conducted to investigate the
   effect of culture on mathematics achievement. Based on Hofstede's
   conceptualization of culture, the present study examined the
   relationship between national culture and students' mathematics
   achievement by analyzing data from 51 countries using two-level
   hierarchical linear modeling. The results showed that national culture
   played an important role in shaping mathematic achievement. It accounted
   for 23.89\% of the country differences in mathematics performance after
   controlling for student gender, family socioeconomic status, and
   national GDP per capita. One cultural dimension ``long-term
   orientation{''} had a strong positive association with mathematics
   achievement. The implication of the findings is discussed, followed by a
   discussion of issues regarding employing culture dimensions theory in
   mathematics education.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the development of e-textbooks. We claim
   that analysis (and design) of e-textbooks requires the development of a
   specific frame. Digital affordances provide particular opportunities
   (e.g. in terms of interactions between users) that require specific
   considerations for their analysis, as teachers and students use them for
   their individual and collective purposes. In this study, we develop a
   framework for mathematics e-textbook analysis, based on the notion of
   ``connectivity.{''} We introduce criteria to assess the different
   aspects of connectivity and build an analysis grid for e-textbooks. We
   illustrate the framework proposed by analyzing 2 commonly used French
   grade 10 mathematics e-textbooks. The results of the analyses show that
   there are major differences between the 2 e-textbooks in terms of
   connectivity, which can be related to differences in their design.
   Beyond these 2 examples, we claim that focusing on connectivity is a
   useful and relevant way of analyzing e-textbooks, as it can provide a
   window into issues of interactivity, both practically and cognitively.},

Abstract = {Recent studies emphasize the importance of learning science while
   considering multiple perspectives on environment, society, economy, and
   technology, which allows learners to relate what they do in the
   classroom to the world beyond. In this study, 68 12-year-old primary
   students from 1 Malaysian school were followed while they engaged in a
   science curriculum centered around 8 environment-related
   socio-scientific issues during a unit on the interaction among living
   things. The analysis shows that the informal reasoning skills of the
   students improved significantly. Progressive implementation of SSI
   activities encouraged students to use evidence-based decision-making,
   improving reasoning modes, and advancing reasoning levels.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an analytic tool for describing the
   mathematics made available to learn in a `textbook lesson'. The tool is
   an adaptation of the Mathematics Discourse in Instruction (MDI) analytic
   tool that we developed to analyze what is made available to learn in
   teachers' lessons. Our motivation to adapt the use of the MDI analytic
   framework to textbooks is to test the relative robustness of the
   framework in moving across different pedagogic texts (e.g. video of a
   lesson, a textbook lesson). Our initial findings suggest it has
   applicability across pedagogic texts, thus opening possibilities for
   using a common framework and language in research and in professional
   development activities involving the written and enacted curricula.},

Abstract = {Coordination of multiple representations (CMR) is widely recognized as a
   critical skill in mathematics and is frequently demanded in reform
   calculus textbooks. However, little is known about the prevalence of
   coordination tasks in such textbooks. We coded 707 instances of CMR in a
   widely used reform calculus textbook and analyzed the distributions of
   coordination tasks by chapter and for the type of task demanded
   (perception vs. construction). Results suggest that different
   coordination tasks are used earlier and later in learning and for
   different topics, as well as for specific pedagogical and scaffolding
   purposes. For example, the algebra-to-text coordination task was more
   prevalent in the first chapter, suggesting that students are being eased
   into calculus content. By contrast, requests to construct graphs from
   algebraic expressions were emphasized in later chapters, suggesting that
   students are being pushed to think more conceptually about functions.
   Our nuanced look at coordination tasks in a reform textbook has
   implications for research in teaching and learning calculus.},

Abstract = {A large part of the media landscape surrounding us consists of
   advertising. Therefore, skills for critically coping with advertising
   are indispensable. Students need to develop such skills for evaluating
   messages and facts from advertisements. They also need to learn about
   the mechanisms behind how advertisements are created and used to
   influence the public. Today, advertising for many products has a strong
   scientific component. However, learning with and about advertising does
   not play a prominent role in school science education. To date,
   advertising is almost exclusively discussed and evaluated within the
   humanities and social sciences, especially language education. The
   scientific components of advertising are not taken into account in these
   subjects. Engaged science teachers might prove to be the key to
   innovation when it comes to media education in the science classroom.
   This study explores both the opinions of German science teachers on the
   importance of scientific media literacy and their attitudes to
   implementing teaching units covering advertising in their science
   classes. Semistructured interviews with 12 secondary science teachers
   were conducted and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Two main
   types of teachers were identified, who have completely different views
   towards learning with and about advertising in science education.},

Abstract = {This study applies the theory of planned behavior as a basis for
   exploring the impact of knowledge, values, subjective norms, perceived
   behavioral controls, and attitudes on the behavioral intention toward
   science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education among
   Taiwanese preservice science teachers. Questionnaires (N = 139)
   collected information on the behavioral intention of preservice science
   teachers engaging in STEM education. Data were analyzed using
   descriptive statistics, path analysis, and analysis of variance. Results
   revealed that, in terms of direct effects, higher perceived behavioral
   control and subjective norms were associated with stronger STEM teaching
   intention. More positive attitude and greater knowledge were indirectly
   associated with higher subjective norms and perceived behavioral
   control, which resulted in stronger STEM teaching intention.
   Additionally, gender did not affect preservice teachers' intention to
   adopt STEM teaching approaches. However, preservice teachers whose
   specialization was in different fields tended to influence their
   knowledge and perceived behavioral control; these issues require further
   investigation.},

Abstract = {This study examines Swedish upper secondary school teachers' gendered
   conceptions about students' mathematical reasoning: whether reasoning
   was considered gendered and, if so, which type of reasoning was
   attributed to girls and boys. The sample consisted of 62 teachers from
   six different schools from four different locations in Sweden, The
   results showed that boys were significantly more often attributed to
   memorised reasoning and delimiting algorithmic reasoning. Girls were
   connected to gamiliar algorithmic reasoning, a reasoning type where you
   use standard method when solving a mathematical task. Creative
   mathematical founded reasoning, which is novel, plausible and founded in
   mathematical properties, was not considered gendered.},

Title = {THE EFFECTS OF EPISTEMIC BELIEFS IN SCIENCE AND GENDER DIFFERENCE ON
   UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' SCIENCE-TEXT READING: AN EYE-TRACKING STUDY},

Abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to explore not only the effects of
   epistemic beliefs in science on science-text reading but also the gender
   differences in epistemic beliefs and the reading process. The
   interactions between gender and epistemic beliefs during reading were
   also explored. A total of 25 university students, 13 male and 12 female,
   were paid to participate in the study. The scientific epistemological
   beliefs (SEBs) questionnaire was used to probe the subjects' epistemic
   beliefs in science, while the eye-tracking method was employed to record
   their science-text reading process. It was demonstrated that the
   participants in the study had developed sophisticated SEBs. Complicated
   SEBs were associated with higher cognitive attention to the reading of
   data-related information but less mental effort to fact, scientific
   explanations, and the microview photos. As for the gender difference,
   female students displayed less mental effort in comprehending scientific
   explanations, but attended more to data and the microview graphic. It is
   argued that female learners are better at processing textual
   information. Interactions between SEBs and gender were found and
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Communication skills are one of the most important competencies for 21st
   century global citizens. Our guiding presupposition was that
   socioscientific issues (SSIs) could be used as an effective pedagogical
   tool for promoting students' communication skills by increasing peer
   interactions, stimulating students' reasoning, and in constructing
   shared social knowledge. We implemented a SSI program on gene
   modification (GM) technology to 132 9th graders in South Korea and
   investigated to what extent this SSI instruction contributed to
   enhancing students' communication skills. Data sources included pre- and
   post-scores on the Communication Skills Questionnaire (CSQ),
   semi-structured interviews with the students and instructor, and
   classroom observations. The results demonstrated that SSI instruction
   could bring about a moderately large impact on students' ability to
   understand the key ideas of others and to value others' perspectives, as
   well as a marginal positive effect on developing active assertions.
   However, SSI instruction appeared to have a lesser impact on students'
   ability to develop shared understanding. Overall, this research
   indicates the potential that even a limited SSI classroom could have in
   terms of promoting students' communication skills in the context of
   their regular science class.},

Abstract = {The study reported here investigated experienced teachers' views on
   several nature of science (NOS) issues 2 to 5 years after they completed
   a demanding secondary science teacher education program in which the NOS
   was an extensive and recurring component. Both quantitative and
   qualitative data were collected and analyzed to determine study
   participants' NOS understanding. Study participant's NOS views were
   determined to be generally accurate and robust, suggesting that
   experiences in their science teacher education program had a
   long-lasting positive impact on NOS understanding. The preservice
   program that study participants completed has several unique features
   that may account for that long-lasting impact and has implications for
   preservice and inservice science teacher education professional
   development.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the role of disciplinary climate in the
   classroom and student math self-efficacy on math achievement. The
   student part of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA)
   2003 survey containing 4,199 U.S. observations was employed in a
   weighted least squares nested multiple regression framework to predict
   math achievement from disciplinary climate and self-efficacy in addition
   to several control variables. The results showed that improvement in
   disciplinary climate was associated with a reduction in the achievement
   gap whereas improvement in self-efficacy was associated with an
   expansion in that gap. These effects varied across race and gender. A
   significant interaction effect was found between the disciplinary
   climate and self-efficacy. Educational implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study combines the Japanese lesson study approach and mathematics
   teachers' professional development. The first year of a 4-year project
   in which 3 Dutch secondary school teachers worked cooperatively on
   introducing making sense of the calculus is reported. The analysis
   focusses on instrumental and relational student understanding of
   mathematical concepts and the transition between the conceptual
   embodiment and the operational symbolism of the calculus. This paper
   reports on 2 cycles of lesson studies that took place in the first
   project year, the first cycle focussing on the notion of the derivative
   (introduced for polynomials) and the second on trigonometry (as the
   concepts shift from ratios in a right-angled triangle to functions in
   the calculus). The lesson study cycles resulted in changes in the
   teachers' educational goals and instructional strategies in relation to
   student understanding. However, the teachers' desire to be good
   teachers, their perceived need to prepare students for standard
   examinations and their reluctance to use computers impeded their
   progress in developing a lesson study approach. The introduction of a
   Japanese lesson study approach into a Dutch context merits further
   reflection in the later years of the project.},

Abstract = {In 2001, the Chinese Ministry of Education issued Guidelines for
   Preschool Education (GPE) (trial version) to call on early childhood
   practitioners to use a child-centered and play-based approach to
   teaching and learning. The guidelines also include mathematics within
   the science domain and described its standards in a way that
   significantly lessens the teacher's role as knowledge disseminator.
   Instead, the guidelines encourage mathematics learning and teaching
   through play, self-discovery, and problem solving. This qualitative case
   study examined one kindergarten teacher's implementation of and
   associated challenges in delivering mathematics lessons from a newly
   developed integrated provincial curriculum (PC) and the quality of
   instruction as influenced by using a curriculum that is organized around
   thematic units. The analysis of the curriculum, ten videotaped lessons,
   two teacher interviews, and other supporting documents, such as student
   work and teacher lesson plans, indicated that the teacher encountered
   difficulties implementing the PC as intended due to a number of factors,
   including inadequate curricular resources, incoherency of the curriculum
   design, and a mismatch between the mathematics standards and curriculum
   goals and the teacher's instructional style and teaching philosophy. As
   a result, the quality of mathematics instruction was poor, especially in
   the areas of (1) using effective teaching strategies, (2) providing
   clear and accurate instruction with a positive attitude, (3) engaging
   students in sustained interactions with mathematical ideas, and (4)
   offering on-going assessment and feedback. To close, recommendations for
   curriculum refinement and professional development are provided.},

Abstract = {The day-to-day business of being a science or mathematics teacher
   involves the continuous assessment of students. This, in turn, is an
   inherently discursive process. The aim of the present study is to
   examine some of the specific discursive practices through which science
   and mathematics knowing is jointly produced through classroom
   interaction. In particular, we examine the coproduced nature of two
   students' not knowing-one in an outdoor elementary school science lesson
   and the other in an elementary school mathematics lesson. Our analysis
   is based on ideas in discursive psychology and challenges conventional
   interpretations of students' academic performance in school science and
   mathematics.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the similarities and differences of
   mathematics-related teaching competencies between the future secondary
   school teachers of Taiwan and Singapore by using data from the
   international Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics
   (TEDS-M), organized by the International Association for the Evaluation
   of Educational Achievement. Taiwan and Singapore are identified as the
   only two Asian countries integrating the Chinese/Confucian tradition in
   their education regarding TEDS-M. The relative strengths and weaknesses
   of these two countries, as compared to other TEDS-M higher-achieving
   Western countries, such as Germany, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, and the
   USA, are examined after reselecting and reclassifying the achievement
   items based on Niss' (2003) mathematics competence and Hsieh's
   (Secondary Education, 63(3), 2012) mathematics teaching competence
   structures. This study shows that Singaporean future teachers are weaker
   in the competence of devising formal mathematical arguments and
   transforming heuristic ideas into valid proofs than Taiwanese future
   teachers. Taiwan and Singapore demonstrate relative strengths at
   primary, lower-, and upper-secondary levels in mathematics competencies
   but show relative weaknesses at the tertiary level than do other
   higher-achieving Western countries. Comparing these two countries,
   Taiwan shows relative strengths at upper-secondary and tertiary levels,
   and Singaporean strengths are at primary and lower-secondary levels.
   This distinction is primarily because of the thought-oriented category
   of mathematics competencies. This study also finds that Taiwan and

Abstract = {The concept of function is a central but difficult topic in secondary
   school mathematics curricula, which encompasses a transition from an
   operational to a structural view. The question in this paper is how the
   use of computer tools may foster this transition. With domain-specific
   pedagogical knowledge on the learning of function as a point of
   departure and the notions of emergent modeling and instrumentation as
   design heuristics, a potentially rich technology-intensive learning
   arrangement for grade 8 students was designed and field-tested. The
   results suggest that the relationship between tool use and conceptual
   development benefits from preliminary activities, from tools offering
   representations that allow for progressively increasing levels of
   reasoning, and from intertwinement with paper-and-pencil work.},

Abstract = {Thermal physics is in the realm of everyday experience, underlies
   current environmental concerns, and underpins studies in sciences,
   health and engineering. In the state of NSW in Australia, the coverage
   of thermal topics in high school is minimal, and, hence, so is the
   conceptual understanding of students. This study takes a new approach at
   exploring conceptions of students with a qualitative analysis
   facilitated by NVivo complemented with reference to sociocultural ideas
   of learning. A 2-part pen and paper question was given to 598 first year
   university students of different educational backgrounds (and therefore
   physics expertise). `The Question' was based on 2 familiar scenarios and
   required the selection of a concept first, followed by an explanation.
   The results showed that concepts were favoured based on a student's
   everyday experience and their curriculum through high school, and some
   were more effective than others in making scientifically congruent
   responses. The reported thermal physics alternative conceptions were
   also examined in our sample, and students' reasoning behind such
   conceptions indicate that some conceptions do not inhibit scientifically
   congruent responses whilst others do. The results implicate language and
   the everyday experiences of the student in the teaching and learning of
   thermal physics.},

   accuracy of their responses to acid-base test items. A total of 147 (76
   male, 71 female) students provided item-specific confidence judgments
   during a test of their knowledge of acids and bases. Using the
   correctness of the answer responses, a confidence rating score, an
   unweighted rating score, and a relative confidence rating score were
   calculated for each respondent. The correlations between the boys and
   girls for each score area showed girls as scoring higher than boys in
   their knowledge of acids and bases, were more confident in this
   knowledge, and more willing to express different levels of confidence

Abstract = {The present study aimed at investigating children's and adolescents'
   understanding of constant and accelerated motions. The main objectives
   were (1) to investigate whether different task formats would affect the
   performance and (2) to track developmental changes in this domain. Five
   to 16 year olds (N=157) predicted the distances of a moving vehicle on
   the basis of its movement durations on both a horizontal and an inclined
   plane. The task formats involved: (1) nonverbal action tasks, (2)
   number-based missing-value word problems, and (3) verbal judgments. The
   majority of participants of all age groups based their reactions in the
   first two task types on the assumption of a linear relationship between
   time and distance-which is correct for motions with constant speed but
   incorrect for accelerated motions. However, in the verbal judgments that
   tapped conceptual understanding, children from the age of 8 years
   onwards correctly assumed that an object rolling down an inclined plane
   would accelerate. The role of the task format in evoking erroneous
   beliefs and strategies is discussed.},

Abstract = {Concept inventories are often used to assess current student
   understanding although conceptual change models are problematic. Due to
   controversies with conceptual change models and the realities of student
   assessment, it is important that concept inventories are evaluated using
   a variety of theoretical models to improve quality. This study used a
   modified item response theory model to determine university nonmajor
   biology students' levels of understanding of natural selection (n =
   1,192). Using Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection, we have
   reported how we applied Bock's modified nominal item response theory
   model and the distracter test item analysis. We found that the use of
   this model can define student levels of understanding and identify
   problematic distracters.},

Title = {EQUITY IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE OUTCOMES: CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED
   WITH HIGH AND LOW ACHIEVEMENT ON PISA 2006 IN IRELAND},

Abstract = {Equity in education is a key concern internationally; however, it is
   rare that this issue is examined separately for low-and high-achieving
   students and concurrently across different subject domains. This study
   examines student and school background characteristics associated with
   low and high achievement in mathematics and science on the Programme for
   International Student Assessment. Based on the results of a multilevel
   multinomial model of achievement for each domain, findings indicate that
   a greater number of the variables examined are associated with low
   rather than high achievement. At student level, home language, intention
   to leave school early, socioeconomic status, grade level, cultural
   capital, and books in the home are significantly associated with
   achievement in mathematics and science. At school level, only school
   average socioeconomic status is statistically significant in the models.
   Significant gender differences are found in the distribution of high and
   low achievers, which vary across the domains. In mathematics, females
   are more likely to be low achievers while males are more likely to be
   high achievers. In science, gender interacts with early school-leaving
   intent whereas males intending to leave school early are more likely to
   be in the low-achieving group than females intending to leave early.
   Conclusions emphasise the need for targeting resources aimed at
   promoting equity in outcomes at student level as well as at school
   level. Future work may extend the current analyses by incorporating
   domain-specific variables or examining cross-country differences.},

Title = {EXAMINING EIGHTH GRADE KUWAITI STUDENTS' RECOGNITION AND INTERPRETATION
   OF REASONABLE ANSWERS},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {This research documents Kuwaiti eighth grade students' performance in
   recognizing reasonable answers and the strategies they used to determine
   reasonableness. The results from over 200 eighth grade students show
   they were generally unable to recognize reasonable answers. Students'
   performance was consistently low across all three number domains (whole
   numbers, fractions, and decimals). There was no significant difference
   in students' performance on items that focused on the practicality of
   the answers or on items that focused on the relationships of numbers and
   the effect of operations, or on both. Interview data revealed that 35\%
   of the students' strategies were derived from two criteria for judging
   answers for reasonableness: the relationships of numbers and the effect
   of operations, and the practicality of the answers. They used strategies
   such as estimation, numerical benchmarks, real-world benchmarks, and
   applied their understanding of the meaning of operations. However, over
   60\% of the students' strategies were procedurally driven. That is, they
   relied on algorithmic techniques such as carrying out paper-and-pencil
   procedures. Additionally, some of the students' strategies reflected
   misunderstandings of how and when to apply certain procedures. Given
   these findings, mathematics education in Kuwait should shift the
   emphasis from paper-and-pencil procedures and provide systematic
   attention to the development of number sense and computational
   estimation so Kuwaiti students will be more adept at recognizing
   reasonable answers.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect on student performance in drawing
   their attention to relevant task variables, focusing on accuracy of
   responses and reaction times. We chose this methodology in order to
   better understand how such interventions affect the reasoning process.
   The study employs a geometry task in which the irrelevant salient
   variable (area) interferes with the reasoning process related to
   perimeter comparison. We compared eighth graders' performances in a
   pretest and a posttest, with or without intervention. The posttest
   results showed that raising students' awareness of the relevant task
   variable activates effortful and time-consuming control mechanisms which
   help them overcome the interference of the irrelevant variable. The
   paper discusses the educational importance of helping students to attend
   selectively to relevant information in order to overcome interference,
   thus promoting logical reasoning.},

Abstract = {Responding to concerns that engineering is a poorly understood
   occupation and that young people are exposed to stereotyped images of
   scientists and engineers at an early age, this investigation sought to
   identify how science and engineering is portrayed in contemporary junior
   fiction (ages 8-12) and to what extent. An examination of 4,800 junior
   fiction titles in one region in New South Wales, Australia, identified
   as few as 71 titles that addressed themes related to engineering and the
   sciences. While the crazy, nerdy, scientific stereotype exists in these
   stories, mostly in humorous vein, we found that fictional characters
   were split between the nerdy, eccentric, and the more serious and
   professional types who were depicted as more popular. The emphasis was
   on male characters, but not exclusively so. There were limited details
   that could be associated with engineering. Where building, making, and
   working with machines featured, they were depicted as male activity and
   primarily connected to vehicles, mostly cars. We concluded that while
   young people, particularly girls, were unlikely to gain accurate or
   compelling images about engineering as an occupation from this source at
   present, as a medium for informing the young and their parents, the
   potential of fiction was considerable.},

Abstract = {In the US, there is a significant number of learning-disabled high
   school students included in regular science classrooms. It has been
   argued that students with learning disabilities can succeed in science
   if they receive the kind of instruction they need. To facilitate such
   instruction, the special education teacher is often incorporated into
   the class along with the learning disabled students. We observed 53 high
   school science lessons from ten pairs of science and special-education
   teachers who were responsible for delivering instruction to groups of
   students, some of whom were learning-disabled. We analyzed narrative
   notes collected in these lessons reflecting the kinds of classroom
   activities, organization of work, and teachers' roles. In addition, we
   interviewed the teachers individually to gain a better understanding of
   these inclusive classes. The underlying question of this research was
   whether inclusive classes with two teachers delivered the type of
   science education that is better than solo-teaching in addressing the
   needs of learning-disabled students. Our evidence indicates that even
   with a special-education teacher present in the class, learning-disabled
   students usually did not receive a science education that met their
   needs. We elaborate on the reasons for this problem and make suggestions
   for improvement.},

Abstract = {This paper broadly addresses the question of whether university students
   whose major does not require expertise in logic can improve their
   ability in deductive reasoning by taking an introductory course in
   logic. In particular, our study aims to evaluate a course in deductive
   logic offered by one of the authors in a department of elementary
   education. Two experiments were conducted by using a pretest-posttest
   design with an experimental and a control group as well as a follow-up
   test after 6 months on the experimental group. The results of the
   analyses showed that the course mainly succeeded in strengthening
   students' general logical ability in the experimental group and these
   gains were retained 6 months later in the follow-up test. Promises and
   constraints of the study are discussed in the educational context.},

Title = {A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF A CONCEPT MAPPING ENHANCED
   LABORATORY EXPERIENCE ON TURKISH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF
   ACID-BASE CHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {The research reported here consists of the introduction of an
   intervention based on a series of laboratory activities combined with
   concept mapping. The purpose of this intervention was to enhance student
   understanding of acid-base chemistry for tenth grade students' from two
   classes in a Turkish high school. An additional aim was to enhance
   student attitude toward chemistry. In the research design, two cohorts
   of students were compared; those from the intervention group (N=31) and
   a second group (N=28) who were taught in a more traditional manner.
   Student understanding of acid-base chemistry was evaluated with a
   pretest/posttest research design using a purpose-designed instrument,
   the Concept Achievement Test (CAT) consisting of 25 items, 15 multiple
   choice and ten multiple choice with explanation. Alternative conceptions
   identified in the pretest were incorporated into the intervention, which
   thereby sought to move students toward views more in accord with
   scientific views for the concepts. Statistical tests indicate the
   instrument is reliable (with an alpha reliability of 0.81) and the
   analysis of the findings revealed statistically significant differences
   between the intervention and traditional groups with respect to
   conceptual understanding. Examination of student explanations and
   analyses of semi-structured interviews conducted with selected students
   suggest that the main influence was the laboratory activities. Analysis
   of the findings in the context of relevant literature that concept
   mapping in conjunction with laboratory activities is more enjoyable,
   helps student link concepts, and reduces their alternative conceptions.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the patterns of students' performance in
   inductive reasoning, scientific reasoning and science motivation at
   different grade levels. We also examined the interaction of these
   variables with parental factors in predicting students' STEM
   achievement. A cross-sectional study assessed 726 participants from the
   6(th), 8(th), 10(th) and 11(th) grades in 6 secondary schools. The
   findings showed that students in the upper grades achieved higher scores
   on reasoning tests than their counterparts in the lower-grade cohorts,
   but their motivation toward learning science decreased slightly across
   the grade cohorts. Although the students performed better on an
   inductive reasoning test, the developmental patterns were comparable for
   the results on 2 cognitive tests across grade levels. Generally, we
   found that inductive reasoning and scientific reasoning were closely
   tied and that both had a significant effect on STEM achievement, while
   parents' education impacted positively on both STEM performance and
   parental involvement in their children's schooling. However, parental
   involvement and science motivation had a minor-and different-influence
   on students' STEM achievement in the individual grade cohorts. The
   implications for enhancing students' STEM performance are further
   discussed accordingly.},

Abstract = {A theoretical model describing young students' (Grade 3)
   arithmetic-algebraic structure sense was formulated and validated
   empirically (n=130), hypothesizing that young students'
   arithmetic-algebraic structure sense consists of five distinct but
   correlated factors; structure in numerical equivalence and word-problem
   modeling, structure in arithmetic, mathematical structure in number
   sequences, varying quantities and number correspondences, structure in
   patterns, and structure in functions. Data analysis suggested that
   arithmetic and arithmetic-algebraic tasks can be categorized based on
   the proposed model. Analysis traced three categories of students that
   represent different profiles of students. Students of the basic
   arithmetic structure sense profile approach flexibly simple arithmetic
   and patterning tasks that do not require generalization; students of the
   advanced arithmetic structure profile exhibit an awareness of local
   relations by describing the underlined relations in a variety of
   numerical situations. Students of the emergent arithmetic-algebraic
   profile utilize the awareness of mathematical structural relations to
   symbolize functional relations. A structural model showed the importance
   of grasping structure in patterns and describing the mathematical
   structure in numerical situations to develop structure in functions.},

Abstract = {Literacy, specifically reading mathematical text, is an essential
   component of developing deep mathematical understanding. Given the role
   that textbooks play in classroom instruction around the globe, it is
   useful to consider how features of curriculum design might influence
   classroom practice related to reading. Results from studies of a
   curriculum series in which reading mathematics is an embedded design
   feature provide insight on teachers' and students' perceptions on the
   importance and frequency of reading in mathematics and on the strategies
   used. The results have implications for curriculum developers as they
   design mathematics textbooks.},

Title = {Lessons from Lockdown: Parent Perspectives on Home-learning Mathematics
   During COVID-19 Lockdown},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, many parents suddenly had to assume
   responsibility for their children's learning at home. Research conducted
   before the pandemic showed that mathematics homework is often
   unsuccessful or stressful for both parents and children and that tension
   exists between home and school in the learning of mathematics.
   Understanding parents' experience of home-learning mathematics during
   lockdown has implications for positive learning relationships between
   home and school in the future. During the lockdown, we sent an online
   survey to New Zealand parents and received 634 responses. We found that
   parents were generally very engaged in the home learning of mathematics.
   They reported a range of opinions about the quality of mathematics work
   and teacher support, and there was a correlation between general stress
   levels and negative opinions. To further support their child's
   mathematics learning, many parents turned to online mathematics
   programs, about which they were very positive. Parents of younger
   children were more positive about their overall home-learning
   experiences of mathematics, but the crisis brought to the fore several
   pre-existing issues. We argue that these findings have implications for
   mathematics home learning in the future; we suggest that schools listen
   to parental feedback regarding the quality, level, and quantity of
   mathematics work. Additionally, schools could consider ways to deliver
   effective teacher support and to foster parental agency in helping their
   children with mathematics learning.},

Abstract = {Noticing is often dependent on time-sensitivity and uses video or live
   observations. This paper explores loosening the time-sensitivity
   component and implementing self-narrative and inquiry approaches by
   having teachers write to explore noticing. This study explores narrative
   writing of beginning mathematics teachers using a noticing framework as
   opposed to data from video, discussion, or prompted writing as most
   noticing studies have implemented. This study analyzed narrative
   writing, termed written teaching replays, by early career secondary
   mathematics teachers to understand what these teachers attended to when
   writing about a classroom situation. Written teaching replay analysis
   results were similar to other mathematics noticing research studies,
   including earlier teacher development work on beginning teachers' focus
   on self. Differing from this literature, the majority of teaching
   replays did not focus on managing student behavior. The narrative
   inquiry work also revealed teachers connecting the professional
   development experience to their classrooms and vice versa. The paper
   suggests noticing may not need to be captured in the moment and
   highlights potential applications for teacher education and professional
   development as well as implications for research.},

Abstract = {Interest in creativity in mathematics education research is increasing,
   and the field of research is growing. Yet, research on creativity and
   the notions (we use this wording to accumulate understandings, beliefs,
   and ideas about the construct) of creativity that are addressed in
   empirical research are diverse and difficult to organize in an overview,
   with different theoretical backgrounds and theoretical assumptions
   underlying them. The aim of this article is therefore to provide a
   systematic overview of notions of creativity addressed in recent
   empirical research on mathematical education. We conducted a systematic
   literature review, guided by the question, What notions of creativity
   are addressed in current mathematics education research and what
   theoretical foundations do they rely on? The article gives an overview
   of the five predominant notions of creativity that were identified in
   current empirical research in mathematics education from 2006 to 2019.
   We describe and evaluate these notions and identify trends that will
   help to structure this diverse field of research.},

Abstract = {To improve students' mathematics achievement, their errors should be
   treated as an opportunity to stimulate conceptual and procedural
   understanding. Using a teaching scenario, this study investigated 40
   high school teachers' analyses of and responses to a student error(s) in
   solving a quadratic equation by using the factoring method. The
   teachers' responses were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively.
   Analyses results revealed a gap between identified errors and addressed
   ones, as well as a gap between interpreting a knowledge weakness and
   explaining a knowledge focus. While the errors came from conceptual
   aspects of the factoring method, most of the participants offered
   conceptual explanations addressed in a teacher-centered way. The results
   also revealed that student errors and mathematical knowledge were two
   foci of the teachers' responses to students. The broader implications of
   the study for the international community are discussed in accordance
   with the findings.},

Abstract = {The affective domain and its impact on science achievement has been
   studied with increasing attention over the past decade. However, there
   has been little empirical work on how individual interest, and
   facilitation of situational interest in the classroom, facilitates
   learning of concepts within fine-grained units of instruction. Drawing
   upon previous theoretical and empirical work, we test the hypothesis
   that individual interest facilitates situational interest, and that this
   in turn facilitates content learning, with respect to a 10-day health
   education intervention focused on teaching middle school students about
   light, color, and vision. We found that individual interest in science
   facilitates situational interest in the classroom activities and the
   teacher's instruction, and that situational interest has a positive and
   significant effect on learning concepts related to light and vision. Our
   data suggest that facilitating situational interest is a requirement if
   individual interest and prior knowledge are to be effective scaffolds
   for conceptual learning. However, targeting of other affective traits
   like motivation and engagement or cognitive processes like goal setting
   may be necessary to fully harness students' interest toward effective

Abstract = {Fractions are a very important but difficult topic in elementary and
   secondary mathematics curricula around the world. The difficulty in
   teaching and learning fractions is usually caused by their various
   subconstructs. To facilitate learning of fractions, a test consisting of
   20 items was developed to examine 310 sixth graders' hierarchical
   understanding of the part-whole and measure subconstructs of fractions.
   Rasch analysis and cluster analysis were used to analyze the data. The
   results showed six distinguishable levels of understanding of the two
   subconstructs. Briefly, constructing fractions alone was the easiest to
   develop, followed by repartitioning/reconstructing and regarding
   fractions as numbers. The abilities involved at the highest level were
   successively partitioning, defining a unit interval freely and placing
   fractions on number lines. The results also indicated that most of the
   students were able to deal with part-whole subconstruct problems but
   still had difficulty handling measure subconstruct problems by the end
   of their elementary education. They could construct fractions/the whole,
   recognize the number notion of fractions and fractional unit and measure
   distances, but lacked enough ability to partition successively and place
   fractions on number lines. This study provides a clearer picture of
   hierarchy of understanding the two subconstructs and contributes to the
   corresponding development of instructional resources and the
   teaching/learning of fractions.},

Abstract = {This paper examines a didactic phenomenon, a perception that the
   elements of sets have a common property, e.g. that \{1, 2, 3\} and \{a,
   b, c\} are sets but \{1, 2, 3, a, b, c\} is not a set. The paper reports
   manifestations of this phenomenon in one country: across a range of
   school students in textbooks and in curricula and across pre-service and
   in-service teachers. The paper considers interpretations of the results
   under various theoretical frameworks and argues that these
   interpretations can be synthesized around the anthropological theory of
   the didactic. The paper ends with implications for what is taught under
   the name `mathematics'.},

Title = {The Impact of Environmental Education on Environmental and Renewable
   Energy Technology Awareness: Empirical Evidence from Colombia},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {This paper empirically investigates to what extent environmental
   education (EE) at school can explain variation in environmental literacy
   of 15-year-olds in Colombia, while controlling for several other
   student- and school-level confounding factors. We use a two-level nested
   model, where the individual observations are nested within schools.
   Based on the maximum likelihood estimation method, we estimate a linear
   mixed model which contains both fixed effects and random effects. Our
   empirical results only provide weak evidence that environmental
   education can promote a higher level of environmental awareness. The
   relationship between environmental education and awareness of renewable
   energy technologies (RETs) is even weaker. Our findings therefore
   suggest that environmental education should not be considered a magic
   bullet in promoting environmental literacy among students. Additionally,
   we find more reliable predictors for environmental awareness than for
   awareness of RETs. Overall, the socio-economic status, stronger student
   science abilities, parent characteristics, and a few school-level
   characteristics such as quality of education resources and school
   ownership (public versus private) seem to be decisive factors for
   varying levels of environmental literacy among students in Colombia.},

Abstract = {Currently, studies focusing on mathematics education pay more attention
   to the study of the lecturer's knowledge, aiming to understand this
   knowledge, its development, and how it is reflected in the practice of
   teaching. Following this line of research, the present study is based in
   the Mathematics Teacher's Specialized Knowledge (MTSK) model, which
   includes two domains of knowledge, namely, mathematical knowledge and
   pedagogical content knowledge. Through an instrumental case study,
   classroom observation, and a semi-structured interview, we inquire how
   the knowledge of practices in mathematics, one of the subdomains of
   mathematical knowledge, is related to the pedagogical content knowledge
   of a lecturer in a real analysis course. The results show relationships
   between these subdomains considering their nature of support or
   conditioning. In this regard, the lecturer's knowledge of practices in
   mathematics conditions his/her knowledge of mathematics teaching (e.g.
   techniques, metaphors, and analogies). So, a lecturer's teaching goal is
   that students, in addition to understanding the mathematical contents,
   learn how to think mathematically to validate and construct arguments.
   Additionally, a lecturer's knowledge of students' weaknesses in carrying
   out proofs and working with quantifiers is supported by his/her
   knowledge of practice in mathematics (e.g. different methods of proofs
   and statements with quantifiers, as well as their meaning). In this
   respect, the nature of relationships between two or three subdomains of
   the MTSK model contributes to understanding how the lecturer's knowledge
   is integrated and is a good starting point for investigating the
   development of lecturers' mathematical and pedagogical knowledge.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to understand how a learning
   trajectory supports pre-service primary teachers in their noticing of
   students' mathematical understanding. A total of 95 pre-service primary
   school teachers used a learning trajectory related to the part-whole
   meaning of the fraction concept to interpret students' understanding and
   provide instructional decisions. The findings indicate that the learning
   trajectory provided pre-service teachers with a specific language to
   describe students' understanding and helped them to notice students'
   mathematical understanding. Furthermore, the pre-service primary
   teachers who produced a more detailed discourse also proposed more
   suitable activities based on students' understanding. These findings
   suggest that the learning trajectory can act as a scaffold to notice
   students' mathematical understanding.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to validate an instrument to evaluate the
   teaching of mathematics through mathematical processes using a
   structural equation model. To that end, we have administered the
   instrument to 95 in-service Spanish teachers and we have also analysed
   the presence of mathematical processes (problem solving, reasoning and
   proof, communication, connections and representation) in teaching
   practice. The descriptive statistics obtained through a quantitative
   study show that all the items perform similarly in each of the
   processes, obtaining medium to high scores. A change in this trend is
   only detected in some of the items of the mathematical process
   ``connections{''}, which measure if mathematical knowledge is related to
   other disciplines. The results obtained from the exploratory factor
   analysis show a high coefficient for all the processes (higher than
   0.72), as well as a significant p value, and the results obtained from
   the confirmatory factor analysis show an internal consistency of the
   items of each construct, with values greater than 0.8.},

Abstract = {A task-based written survey was administered to 69 pre-service teachers

   different levels of PSTs' content knowledge. However, in cases of
   unconventional examples, PSTs' levels of content knowledge were easily
   discernible. Also, PSTs across different performance levels perceived
   equal partitioning as a key mathematical point and gave it primary
   consideration in sequencing examples, but they interpreted ``equal
   parts{''} in many different ways, and only the high-performance group
   incorporated unconventional examples in making a sequence. In all
   performance levels, the inclusion of a non-example in making a sequence
   was scarce. Implications for improving the teaching of fraction concepts
   in teacher preparation programs are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at contributing to the debate in Mathematics Education
   about the understanding of the dynamics of students' group interactions
   by proposing an interpretative lens, which defines four modes of
   participating in a group on the basis of different kinds of utterances,
   gestures, postures, and glances that each student makes. We apply this
   lens to two selected cases of students working in a small group, and, by
   comparing and contrasting similarities and differences observed through
   our interpretative lens, we attempt to understand how, and under which
   circumstances, the students reach mathematical understanding as a group,
   or not.},

Title = {Empathy Awareness Among Pre-service Teachers: the Case of the Incorrect
   Use of the Intuitive Rule ``Same A-Same B{''}},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Teacher empathy has proven to be highly relevant for the educational
   process and for educational outcomes, while integrating it into the
   teacher practicing process is challenging. This study suggests using
   PSTs' (pre-service students) incorrect responses as a pedagogical tool
   for improving empathy awareness among them so that PSTs can feel empathy
   and not merely learn about empathy. Incorrect responses to conservation
   tasks, recorded in the process of interviewing 47 PSTs who major in
   science education, are used as a first step research. A possible
   approach to the arousal of empathy during the interview was unexpectedly
   revealed to learn about the PSTs' incorrect responses to conservation
   tasks. Confronting PSTs with their incorrect responses resulted in
   feelings of embarrassment, confusion, and even loss of self-confidence.
   Such feelings may help in evoking an attitude of empathy toward student
   errors, increasing PSTs' awareness to tacit knowledge and to students'
   tacit feelings and integrating bottom-up vs. top-down processes during
   PSTs' reflective practice; and might be regulated effectively to better
   instruction.},

Abstract = {The introduction of makerspaces in Science, Technology, Engineering, and
   Math education caused new challenges in research: learning in this
   innovative environment and the exchange of knowledge. The collaboration
   is the essence of most parts of activities in these spaces, and the
   exchange of information is the way to learning. It is usual to analyze
   the collaboration only among human actors. It is also usual to forget
   the role of non-human actors in this process. This paper analyzes the
   role of human and non-human actors in a maker activity. The teachers and
   researchers proposed a challenge to High School students in Brazil where
   the students were instructed to build a bag to transport some screws.
   During the process, some videos were made and later tools of video
   analyses and Social Network Analyses were used to produce topologies of
   information exchanges among the teacher, students, and artifacts. The
   results showed that both artifacts and environment layout play an
   important role in this process.},

Abstract = {The Maker movement has started to influence the field of science
   education. However, a tension exists between the movement's informal
   grassroots learning emphasis on open-ended personalized projects and the
   requirements of the formal and standardized science education
   curriculum. This study explores how high school chemistry teachers in
   Israel experienced a 32-h professional development (PD) course on
   ``Chemistry Teachers as Makers{''} as a vehicle to suggest specific
   recommendations that might productively introduce the Maker approach
   into high school chemistry education. By analyzing the course syllabus,
   in-depth interviews of four participating teachers, teacher projects,
   and reflections of the two course instructors, the study explores how
   the teachers experienced the PD Maker course, i.e., what interested
   them, how they compared themselves to Makers, how they navigated their
   open-ended projects, and what they perceived as the pros and cons for
   introducing Makers into chemistry education. The findings present five
   overarching themes that emerged from the data analysis, which provide
   the background to the study's four interconnected recommendations. The
   study contributes to the research literature on bridging the gap between
   the informal learning emphasis of the Maker movement with the formal
   educational emphasis of high school science, with a focus on the
   professional development of teachers.},

   parents during scaffolding and non-scaffolding interactions were carried
   out. Three mothers, with different parenting styles and education
   levels, and their preschoolers were observed and interviewed. In
   general, the occurrences of contingency, fading and transfer of
   responsibility were found to be scarce. Diagnostic and intervention
   strategies were also analysed and discussed.},

Title = {Progression Trend of Scientific Reasoning from Elementary School to

Abstract = {This study examines progression trends of Chinese students' scientific
   reasoning skills across grade levels from elementary school to
   university. A large-scale survey using the Classroom Test of Scientific
   Reasoning (CTSR) was conducted with 2669 Chinese students at 13 grade
   levels (grades 4-16). The construct validity of the CTSR was first
   examined using Rasch analysis to verify that the various reasoning
   sub-skills targeted by the test (hypothetical-deductive reasoning,
   proportional reasoning, correlation reasoning, probabilistic reasoning,
   and control of variables) form a cohesive cognitive construct. Based on
   an affirmative result, we proceeded to fit grade-level averages to the
   best-fit logistic regression model and generated trend lines for the
   reasoning sub-skills measured by the CTSR. Results show that the
   cross-grade progression trends generally follow continuous paths through
   increasingly greater levels of improvement. While all sub-skills display
   a noticeable growth during middle and high school years, they progress
   across the grades with different rates. Specifically, the development of
   proportional reasoning is fast-paced and large, but the progression of
   hypothetical-deductive reasoning and control of variables is markedly
   tardy and small. Formal science instruction, particularly the emergence
   of multiple domain-specific science courses in middle and high school,
   can influence the cross-grade progression trends. Possible causes and
   future improvement in science education are proposed. This study
   contributes to our understanding about the development of scientific
   reasoning and offers important implications for science instruction and
   research at different grades.},

Title = {The Different Learning Outcomes of High School and College Students on a
   3D-Printing STEAM Engineering Design Curriculum},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {To enable high school students, especially those interested in art and
   design-related careers, to improve their ability to integrate knowledge
   of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in their
   creative design practices and to be familiar with auto manufacturing,
   the development of a bridging curriculum, known as STEAM (science,
   technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) using digital tools such
   as 3D printers, has been increasingly recognized as emergent and vital.
   As a bridging curriculum, it is essential to examine the curriculum with
   respect to high school and college students to highlight the differences
   in their knowledge and skills for improving curriculum development.
   Hence, we conducted a teaching experiment using a CO2-car engineering
   design curriculum in this study to analyze the learning outcomes of four
   groups of students (three 3D-printing groups: 108 high school students,
   12 design college students, and 12 engineering college students; one
   handmade group: 36 high school students) to assess their competencies.
   The results of the present study highlight significant differences in
   creativity, forecast accuracy, race outcomes, and learning outcomes.
   Suggestions based on the results were generated to improve the
   curriculum. The findings in this study serve as a reference for the
   future design, development, and implementation of STEAM curricula.},

Title = {Elementary Teachers' Perceptions of Their Professional Teaching
   Competencies: Differences Between Teachers of Math/Science Majors and
   Non-math/Science Majors in Taiwan},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to probe the differences of perceived
   professional teaching competence between elementary school math/science
   teachers in Taiwan who are majored in math/science and those who are
   not. A researcher-developed Math/Science Teachers' Professional
   Development Questionnaire was used in a nationwide survey, using a
   two-stage stratified random sampling involving 556 elementary schools
   and 1374 math/science elementary school teachers. The original
   questionnaire consisted of a total of 105 Likert scale questions
   distributed unevenly among four subscales. In this study, the authors
   selected a subset of 63 items from the above questionnaire and analyzed
   the available data in order to find out whether there is any significant
   difference in the perceived professional teaching competencies between
   the two groups of elementary school math/science teachers. The internal
   reliability of the selected items as measured by Cronbach's alpha was
   .97, while the result of a factor analysis indicated that the selected
   subset of items contained 10 key factors. ANOVA tests were conducted
   subsequently, and the results indicated that there were 9 key factors in
   which significant difference between the two groups of teachers existed.
   Considering their practical significance, two factors focusing
   respectively on teachers' self-efficacy in inquiry skills and abilities
   to provide students a learning environment that helps them understand
   the nature of math/science were identified as areas in which
   professional competencies for non-math/science majors need to be
   strengthened.},

Abstract = {Using a sample of 310 Year 10 Chinese students from Hong Kong, this
   survey study examined the effects of multiple goals in learning
   mathematics. Independent variables were mastery, performance-approach,
   performance-avoidance, and pro-social goals. Dependent variables
   included perceived classroom goal structures, teacher's support,
   learning motives and strategies, attitudes, and grade aspiration. Based
   on regression and cluster analyses, this study found convergent evidence
   supporting the benefits of adopting additional adaptive goals alongside
   mastery goals. Regression analyses located significant interaction
   between pro-social goals and mastery goals in predicting higher levels
   of positive learning attitudes and lower levels of surface learning
   motives. Cluster analyses confirmed that students endorsing pro-social
   goals, performance-approach goals and mastery goals in their goal
   profiles had an adaptive pattern of perceptions, use of strategies,
   learning motives and grade aspiration in mathematics.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore elementary students' listening
   comprehension changes using a Web-based teaching system that can
   diagnose and remediate students' science listening comprehension
   problems during scientific inquiry. The 3-component system consisted of
   a 9-item science listening comprehension test, a 37-item diagnostic
   test, and 107 scaffoldings of listening strategies. The diagnostic and
   remediation system was trialed with grade 6 students (NaEuro,= 526) from
   southern Taiwan who were selected by cluster sampling. The participants
   were asked to take the 3 components individually on a computer. The
   students' responses were collected and analyzed to document performance
   and changes. Results indicated that the diagnostic test had a positive
   influence on science listening comprehension proficiency and addressed
   potential problems, while the scaffolding helped remediate confirmed
   listening difficulties. Instructional implications for classroom
   diagnosis-remediation applications are discussed and future research is
   outlined.},

Abstract = {Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) 1998/1999,
   we examine the relationship between elementary students' (K-5)
   manipulative use and mathematics learning. Using a cross-sectional
   correlational analysis, we found no relationship between manipulative
   use and student mathematics achievement. However, using a longitudinal
   analysis, we documented a positive relationship between manipulative use
   and student mathematics learning during their elementary school years
   (K-5). From a teaching and learning perspective, these findings provide
   important evidence of the influence of long-term manipulative use on
   students' overall learning. From policy and methodological perspectives,
   these findings provide evidence for the importance of modeling student
   learning (as opposed to achievement) when studying the effectiveness of
   instructional strategies.},

Abstract = {Past research in calculus education has shown that Riemann sum-based
   conceptions of the definite integral, such as the multiplicatively based
   summation (MBS) conception, can have important value in interpreting and
   making sense of certain types of definite integral expressions. However,
   additional research has shown that students tend to not draw on the MBS
   conception, even in situations where it would be advantageous to do so.
   In this study we examine how introductory instruction on integration, in
   which explicit attention is given to the Riemann sum and Riemann
   integral, may be related to students' tendency to not use the MBS
   conception. In particular, it appears that some calculus instructors may
   make instructional moves in their classrooms that directly undermine the
   time the instructors had spent developing the Riemann sum and Riemann
   integral concepts. In doing so, students may perceive these concepts
   only as calculational procedures, rather than as a potential source of
   conceptual meaning.},

Abstract = {This article explores the impact of an augmented reality iPad-based
   mobile game, called The Great STEM Caper, on students' interaction at a
   science center. An open-source, location-based game platform called ARIS
   (i.e. Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling) was used to create
   an iPad-based mobile game. The game used QR scan codes and a
   challenge-based game structure to encourage engagement in science.
   Participants wore head-mounted GoPro cameras to record interactions
   within the physical and social environment. The purpose of this research
   was to study the impact of a mobile game on student interactions in a
   science center. Gender differences in gameplay behaviors and perceptions
   were compared. The study included a quasi-experimental design with two
   groups: one group that played the iPad mobile game during their science
   center visit, and one group that explored the science center in a
   traditional free exploration manner. Video data from the GoPro cameras
   provided examination of the different ways students interacted with the
   science center. The female students outperformed the male students on
   every measure of the iPad game achievement. Lazzaro's (2004) four types
   of fun was used to describe the gender differences in game perceptions
   and interactions. Females tended to enjoy hard fun and collaborative
   people fun, while males enjoyed easy fun and competitive people fun. The
   females tended to be more goal-oriented, persistent in the face of
   difficulty, and appreciative of hard fun. The results of this study have
   implications for the design of mobile-based gaming technology to
   encourage interaction in an informal science center setting.},

Abstract = {Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in early
   childhood education is an area currently given little attention in the
   literature, which is unfortunate since young children are natural
   scientists and engineers. Here, we outline our mixed-methods
   design-based research investigation of a pre-kindergarten (Pre-K)
   classroom where two early childhood educators are incorporating STEM
   activities. We used a protocol consisting of a list of potential
   characteristics of effective and appropriate STEM curriculum for young
   children to structure our classroom observations. We also used
   semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a questionnaire to collect
   data from multiple stakeholders (teachers, students, and parents), to
   examine how STEM activities were incorporated in Pre-K, to explore
   students' engagement with STEM concepts, and to investigate parents'
   opinions about STEM in general and STEM as experienced by their
   children. Our findings provide support for the inclusion of STEM-based
   learning experiences for young children.},

Abstract = {Although a major goal of Science, Technology, Engineering, and
   Mathematics (STEM) education is to develop scientific literacy, prior
   efforts at measuring scientific literacy have not attempted to link
   scientific literacy with success in STEM fields. The current Scientific
   Literacy Survey for College Preparedness in STEM (SLSCP-STEM) scale was
   specifically developed to predict the academic preparedness of incoming
   freshman STEM majors. The SLSCP-STEM was developed within the context of
   utilitarian scientific literacy and allows independent assessment of
   three dimensions of scientific literacy: (a) attitudinal and behavioral
   domains of scientific literacy, (b) content knowledge of scientific
   concepts, and (c) scientific reasoning skills. This paper presents the
   theoretical framework for the development of the scale along with
   supporting data on its validity and reliability. The SLSCP-STEM
   demonstrated reliability including tests of internal consistency
   {[}attitude/behavior dimension (alpha = .86), content knowledge
   dimension (alpha = .73), scientific reasoning dimension (alpha = .72)]
   and instrument stability over time {[}attitude/behavior dimension (r =
   0.88, p < .01), content knowledge dimension (r = 0.74, p < .01),
   scientific reasoning dimension (r = 0.80, p < .01)]. Furthermore,
   content validity, tested with expert science faculty members,
   demonstrated that the content knowledge sections were relevant for
   freshman STEM majors. Finally, item analysis verified appropriate item
   difficulty level and item discrimination.},

Abstract = {This study reports on the algebraic generalization strategies used by
   elementary and middle/high school pre-service mathematics teachers in
   Kuwait. They were presented with 9 tasks that involved linear,
   exponential, and quadratic situations. The results showed that these
   pre-service teachers had difficulty in generalizing algebraic rules in
   all 3 types of tasks. The most difficult problems were those involving
   exponents; they seemed to confuse exponential growth with the
   multiplication of n. Although they used several strategies such as
   explicit, recursive, and chunking, they tended to rely on explicit
   reasoning. They saw the explicit rule as a quick and easy rule to be
   used. In order to improve students' understanding of algebraic
   reasoning, we must improve the understating of generalization. Teachers'
   programs should put more emphasis on the type of content that teachers
   need to learn rather than on how much mathematics credits teachers need.},

Abstract = {To improve the quality of education, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Education
   has encouraged schools to implement inquiry-based instruction. This
   study identifies psychosocial factors that predict teachers' intention
   to use inquiry-based instruction in their science classrooms. An adapted
   model of Ajzen's (1985) theory of planned behaviour-the Science Adoption
   Model-was used to study Kuwaiti science teachers' beliefs. Four hundred
   and ninety-six teachers from all the government primary schools in
   Kuwait completed a questionnaire. The data were analysed using the
   Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) to statistically
   examine the relationships among the constructs of the model. It was
   found that teachers' attitudes towards using inquiry-based instruction
   significantly predicted their capacity to create and deliver
   inquiry-based lessons. Although Kuwaiti science teachers held positive
   beliefs about the implementation of inquiry-based instruction, many
   factors limited their use of this approach in their science classroom.
   One clear implication from this study is that educators need to overtly
   consider teachers' beliefs as inquiry-based instruction reform is
   implemented.},

Abstract = {As China and the United States become the top two carbon emitters in the
   world, it is crucial for citizens in both countries to construct a
   sophisticated understanding of energy consumption issues. This interview
   study examines how U.S. and Chinese students compare in explaining and
   arguing about two critical energy consumption issues: burning fossil
   fuels and using electricity. In particular, we focused on using
   scientific knowledge to explain and argue about these issues. Based on
   relevant literature and our previous research, we developed a model to
   guide separate assessment and evaluation of students' argumentation and
   explanation. We conducted clinical interviews with 40 biology majors,
   including 20 U.S. students and 20 Chinese students. This study generated
   several important findings. First, Chinese students tended to be less
   consistent across explanations and argumentation, and their levels of
   argumentation were lower than their levels of explanation. Second, in
   comparison to their Chinese counterparts, U.S. students provided more
   scientific arguments but many fewer scientific explanations. Finally,
   although all participants were college students and had completed at
   least one introductory level science course before the interviews, some
   of their explanations and arguments were based on informal ideas rather
   than matter and energy. We discuss the possible interpretations of these
   findings and their implications for teaching and learning of scientific
   explanation and argumentation in both countries.},

Title = {Developing a Structural Model on the Relationship among Motivational

Abstract = {This study examines the interrelationships among students' motivational
   beliefs (i.e. achievement goal orientations, perception of classroom
   goal structure, and self-efficacy), use of self-regulated learning
   strategies (i.e. elaboration, organization, and metacognitive
   self-regulation strategies), and achievement in mathematics, by
   proposing and testing a structural model. Participants were 1,019
   seventh grade students, enrolled in public elementary schools in Ankara,
   Turkey. Self-report questionnaires and a mathematics test were
   administered to participants during their regular class periods. Results
   revealed that students' perception of classroom goal structure was
   significantly related to their adoption of achievement goals. Among
   achievement goals, only mastery goal orientation was significantly
   related to use of self-regulated learning strategies and mathematics
   achievement. Among self-regulated learning strategies, only elaboration
   was significantly related to mathematics achievement. In addition,
   self-efficacy was associated with achievement goals, use of
   self-regulated learning strategies, and mathematics achievement. These
   results supported many of the hypothesized relationships, and offered
   additional clarification for the literature. Possible explanations are
   discussed regarding both the expected and unexpected outcomes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate whether participating in
   science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) project-based
   learning (PBL) activities effected students who had varied performance
   levels and to what extent students' individual factors influenced their
   mathematics achievement. STEM PBL has been a critical challenge to be
   embedded in schools, thus the effect of STEM PBL should to be examined.
   Teachers in 3 high schools attended sustained professional developments
   provided by 1 STEM center based in a Southwestern university and were
   required to implement STEM PBLs once in every 6 weeks for 3 years (2008
   through 2010). The participants were 836 high school students in these 3
   schools who took the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS)
   test and had scores at least in the initial year. Hierarchical linear
   modeling was used to analyze the data using student's mathematics TAKS
   scores and demographic information for the longitudinal study. STEM PBL
   instruction influenced student achievement in mathematics by both
   student demographic backgrounds and performance levels. Low performing
   students showed statistically significantly higher growth rates on
   mathematics scores than high and middle performing students over the 3
   years. In addition, student's ethnicity and economic status were good
   predictors of academic achievement. Results of the present study implied
   that STEM PBLs in schools benefitted low performing students to a
   greater extent and decreased the achievement gap.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, research has shown the challenge posed to teachers by
   science education in informal contexts such as science museums or
   centres. In addition, there is consensus that in the case of pupils
   visiting a science centre, learning improves when the visit is connected
   to the classroom curriculum, so the teachers' involvement in preparing a
   visit is essential. In this work, we present research into primary and
   secondary school teachers' behaviour when preparing a school visit to
   the `Eureka Science Museum' in San Sebastian. Semistructured interviews
   were conducted for 158 teachers (87 from primary and 71 from secondary
   education). The results show that most teachers who visit this centre
   with their class group scarcely prepare for the visit, i.e. they do not
   have a clear idea of how to use the museum as an informal resource for
   learning about science.},

Abstract = {This research study examined the effect of origami-based geometry
   instruction on spatial visualization, geometry achievement, and
   geometric reasoning of tenth-grade students in Turkey. The sample (n =
   184) was chosen from a tenth-grade population of a public high school in
   Turkey. It was a quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design. A control
   group (94 students) received regular instruction during a geometry unit
   in a tenth-grade classroom whereas an experimental group (90 students)
   received origami-based instruction for 4 weeks. The Spatial
   Visualization Test (SVT) was used to measure students' spatial
   visualization ability in this study. The SVT consists of the Card
   Rotation Test, Cube Comparison Test, and the Paper Folding Test which
   were originally developed by Ekstrom, French, Harman \& Derman (1976)
   and translated into Turkish by Delialioglu (1996). Besides, Geometry
   Achievement Test and Geometric Reasoning Test were developed by the
   researcher to measure geometry achievement level and geometric reasoning
   level of participants in key aspects of triangles. All tests had
   versions of pretest and posttest, and these tests were administered to
   both groups. A repeated-measures Analysis of Variance was used on each
   test scores to analyze data. The results indicated that origami-based
   instruction had significant effect on all dependent variables (spatial
   visualization, geometry achievement, and geometric reasoning). This
   suggested that origami might be integrated into high school geometry
   lessons to make geometry learning more effective.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a
   relationship between pre-service science teachers' Field Dependent or
   Field Independent (FD/FI) cognitive styles and the application of
   degrees of naive impetus theory. The sample consisted of 122 pre-service
   science teachers (97 females and 25 males) who were enrolled in the
   Introductory Physics course required by the Science Education program.
   Data were collected in two successive years, after the completion of the
   required Introductory Physics undergraduate courses, in 2008 and 2009.
   The Group Embedded Figure Test and Impetus Theory Application Test (a
   two-tier-type test) were administered to assess the FD/FI tendency of
   students and to determine the degree students applied the na < ve
   impetus theory, respectively. Initial results showed that a majority of
   students had made use of the native impetus theory repeatedly. The
   results also indicated that the degree to which students applied the na
   < ve impetus theory was statistically related to their FD/FI cognitive
   styles. The findings of this research showed that there existed a
   statistically significant difference between the FI and FD students'
   degree of applying the na < ve impetus theory in favor of FI students.
   However, the test score gap between FI and FD students remained almost
   constant regardless of the testing instruments utilized in this study.},

Abstract = {Tracing the path from a numerical Riemann sum approximating the area
   under a curve to a definite integral representing the precise area in
   various texts and online presentations, we found 3 semiotic registers
   that are used: the geometric register, the numerical register, and the
   symbolic register. The symbolic register had 3 representations: an
   expanded sum, a sum in sigma notation, and the definite integral.
   Reviewing the same texts, we found that in the presentation of double
   and triple integrals, not a single textbook continues to present the
   numerical register and the expanded sum representation of the symbolic
   register. They are implied and the expectation appears to be that
   students no longer need them. The omission of these representations is
   quite ubiquitous and correspondingly affects millions of students.
   Materials that present the missing numerical register representation and
   the expanded sum representation of the symbolic register throughout
   topics associated with double and triple integrals have been created.
   This paper presents the results of a clinical study on the improvement
   of student comprehension of multivariable integral topics when these
   representations are included.},

Abstract = {Research indicates that differentiated practices enhance the likelihood
   of meeting the needs of students who find literacy learning challenging
   (Tobin \& McInnes, 2008; Tomlinson, 2003). The aim of the professional
   development project described here was to leverage these findings and to
   build the foundation for future research exploring if similar outcomes
   occurred in science. We wanted to examine teachers' perceptions
   regarding planning and implementing Differentiated Instruction (DI) in
   science. Our workshops emphasized multimodal possibilities, so the
   project draws on research indicating that elementary students are able
   to demonstrate their understanding of science concepts in a variety of
   ways (Tippett, 2003) as well as research on DI in the context of
   language and literacy instruction. The study yielded insights about
   in-service teachers' perceptions of the possibilities and potential
   barriers presented by DI in science.},

Abstract = {Spain was 1 of the 17 countries that participated in the International
   Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement's Teacher
   Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M 2008). In this
   paper, we explore and describe the structure of Spanish primary
   mathematics teacher education programs. We analyzed the documents
   collected from the 48 sampled Spanish institutions that participated in
   TEDS-M. Our approach to the syllabus analysis focused on the established
   content dimension of curriculum in educators' syllabi. These contents
   are structured into 4 knowledge domains-school mathematics, advanced
   mathematics, general pedagogy, and mathematics pedagogy-and categorized
   into subjects and topics. The results show that Spanish teacher
   education programs are diverse across institutions, but follow a basic
   structure that emphasizes the teaching of general pedagogy subjects.},

   domain-specific epistemological beliefs and to investigate whether
   preservice teachers distinguish disciplinary differences (physics,
   chemistry, and biology) in domain-specific epistemological beliefs.
   Mixed-method research design guided the present research. The researcher
   explored three epistemological dimensions: certainty and simplicity of
   knowledge, justification for knowing, and source of knowledge. Both
   quantitative and qualitative results suggested that a domain-specific
   epistemological beliefs system is a valid model to describe preservice
   teachers' epistemological beliefs. In terms of epistemological beliefs,
   disciplinary differences in physics, chemistry, and biology were
   discussed in the last parts of the study.},

Abstract = {From the sociocultural perspective, this research utilized activity
   theory as the theoretical framework to analyze the influences of
   cultural factors for Taiwanese Atayal junior high school students' study
   in mathematics. The research methodology adopted grounded theory,
   theoretical and methodological approaches which are illustrated through
   episodes from a study of the mathematics teaching and learning in a
   year-13 class, where Atayal students were considered as ``lower
   achievers{''} in their year group. We show a way to address complexity
   in the activity of learning and its development based on recognition of
   central cultural factors in mathematics teaching-learning by the use of
   the activity system. Analysis through this systematic network can reveal
   the factors influencing Atayal students' learning of mathematics under
   their cultural background. The tension between Atayal culture's speech
   representation system and Chinese culture's literal representation
   system causes Atayal students difficulties in carrying out the
   transformation of representations. Tension formed between Atayal
   students' holistic thinking style and the analytic thinking style
   presented in teaching material and teaching activities is unfavorable to
   their understanding of mathematical concepts. From a teaching practice
   perspective, Atayal students can be more actively involved in
   mathematics learning activities when the tension between the
   teaching/learning systems is considered. As for the theoretical
   structure, the analysis structure of classroom activity and the design
   of teaching activities developed from a sociocultural orientation and
   activity theory can indeed improve Atayal students' mathematical
   learning within the cultural stream.},

Abstract = {Beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing have been investigated
   extensively in educational and developmental psychology research.
   Hofer's framework on personal epistemology is adopted in the present
   study for assessing Lebanese university students' epistemologies of
   science. Participants were 213 students in their first year of
   science-related studies at a private university in Beirut. Two
   instruments were used for data collection: The science-focused
   epistemological beliefs questionnaire (Hofer, 2000) and an 8-item
   instrument adapted from the modified version of the ``Views on
   Science-Technology-Society{''} (Dogan \& Abd-El-Khalick, 2008), and an
   additional item developed by the authors. Thirty students were
   purposively selected for completing the second instrument followed by a
   semi-structured interview. Data analysis yielded the following
   assertions regarding students' epistemologies of science: (1) Scientific
   knowledge is liable to change; (2) the source of scientists' knowledge
   is inherent to human's construction, whereas the source of personal
   knowledge is independent from human subjectivity and based on external
   authority; (3) scientific knowledge is proven and validated through the
   concerted effort of scientists; and (4) absolute truth cannot be
   attained because of the lack of means to access knowledge. Findings
   highlighted the need to foster an academic culture that promotes
   students' epistemologies and explicitly addresses the nature and
   processes of science in curricula and instruction.},

Abstract = {This study compares the effects of two methods of
   teaching-teacher-centered and cooperative learning-on students' science
   achievement and use of social skills. The sample consists of 163 female
   elementary science students in 8 intact grade 5 classes who were
   assigned to 2 instructional methods and were taught an identical science
   unit by 4 classroom teachers. The students' science achievement was
   measured by a researcher-designed achievement test given to students as
   a pretest and a posttest. Students' social skills were determined by a
   researcher-designed survey administered as a pretest and posttest.
   Analysis of the achievement test scores and the social skills survey
   responses revealed that cooperative learning strategies have
   significantly (p > 0.05) more positive effects on both students'
   achievement and social skills than teacher-centered strategies. These
   results provide an evidential base to inform policy decisions and
   encourage and persuade teachers to implement cooperative learning
   methods in Kuwaiti classrooms.},

Abstract = {Students' interest in studying science and their aspirations to pursue
   science-related careers is a topic of global concern. In this paper, a
   set of data gathered for the initial phase of the 5-year study of
   Science Aspirations and Careers: Age 10-14 (the ASPIRES project) is
   presented. In the initial phase of this project, a questionnaire
   exploring students' aspirations was developed, validated and trialled
   with nearly 300 primary school students. Principal component analyses
   and Cronbach's alpha revealed that the questionnaire was comprised of a
   number of unidimensional components and that reliability was acceptable.
   Further multivariate analyses indicated that students' aspirations in
   science were most strongly predicted by parental attitudes to science,
   attitudes towards school science, self-concept in science, images of
   scientists and engagement in science-related activities outside of
   school. Moreover, `Asian' students appeared to exhibit a highly positive
   set of attitudes towards science and aspirations in science,
   particularly when compared with White students. Reasons for this
   observed difference are also explored.},

Abstract = {We report on a project currently in progress that aims to identify
   through research the range of factors (individual, school and
   out-of-school, including home) and their interactions that influence
   post-16 (i.e. post-compulsory) participation in mathematics and physics
   in the UK and to assess their relative importance among different
   student populations. In this project, we are beginning to elucidate the
   views of students and examine the sources of these views by exploring
   the contexts in which both school and university students experience
   barriers or opportunities and form their identities with regard to
   participation in mathematics and physics. Our focus in this paper is on
   our methodology, the reasons for it and how and why our approach to data
   collection developed during the project. We situate our work within a
   mixed-methods approach, using multilevel modelling and discourse
   analysis to analyse and interpret our findings that derive from our own
   questionnaires, interviews and ethnography and from existing large-scale
   datasets. We argue that greater acknowledgement in the education
   literatures that investigate student participation in mathematics and
   science needs to be made than is usual of the range of factors,
   including unconscious forces that may affect participation.},

Abstract = {Connected classroom technology (CCT) is a member of a broad class of
   interactive assessment devices that facilitate communication between
   students and teachers and allow for the rapid aggregation and display of
   student learning data. Technology innovations such as CCT have been
   demonstrated to positively impact student achievement when integrated
   into a variety of classroom contexts. However, teachers are unlikely to
   implement a new instructional practice unless they perceive the
   practical value of the reform. Practicality consists of three
   constructs: congruence with teacher's values and practice;
   instrumentality-compatibility with the existing school structures; and
   cost/benefits-whether the reward is worth the effort. This study uses
   practicality as a framework for understanding CCT implementation in
   secondary classrooms. The experiences of three science teachers in their
   first year implementing CCT are compared with matched-pair mathematics
   teachers. Findings suggest that despite some differences in specific
   uses and purposes for CCT, the integration of CCT into regular classroom
   practice is quite similar in mathematics and science classrooms. These
   findings highlight important considerations for the implementation of
   educational technology.},

Abstract = {This study investigated Turkish preservice, elementary teachers'
   personal mathematics teaching efficacy (PMTE), and science teaching
   efficacy (PSTE) beliefs at the end of their teacher education program. A
   majority of the participants believed they were well prepared to teach
   both elementary mathematics and science, but their PSTE scores were
   significantly lower than their PMTE scores. However, a significant
   correlation was found between the PMTE and PSTE scores. No significant
   gender effect on PMTE and PSTE scores was observed, but unlike the
   results from other countries, Turkish female preservice elementary
   teachers were found to have slightly higher PMTE and PSTE scores than
   their male peers. High school major area was found to be a significant
   predictor of participants' PMTE and PSTE scores. Participants with
   mathematics/science high school majors were found to have significantly
   higher PMTE and PSTE scores than those with other high school majors.},

Abstract = {The World Wide Web is increasingly being used as a vehicle for flexible
   learning, where learning is seen to be free from time, geographical, and
   participation constraints. In addition to flexibility, the Web
   facilitates student-centered approaches, creating a motivating and
   active learning environment. The purpose of this study is to set up an
   adaptive learning environment on Internet and to experiment with the
   most suitable methods and applications. Our goal is to provide a better
   solution with regard to the related distance learning research. All the
   resources and background are from current relevant documents on the
   theory of asynchronous distance education. We set up an adaptive
   Internet learning system based on learning theory and related learning
   models. Our research targets are those students who took the `life
   chemistry' course for the asynchronous distance education environment at
   Providence University in Taiwan. The students were divided randomly into
   two groups: the experimental group, which was in an adaptive learning
   environment, and the controlled group, which was in a non-adaptive one.
   We used the American Chemistry Society test bank as our research tool
   and used SPSS to analyse the data we obtained. Results show that the
   experimental group in the adaptive learning environment out-performs the
   controlled group. In addition, those students who are field independent
   learning types, have higher pre-knowledge, are male, in science
   departments and have a longer study time span in an adaptive learning
   environment show much greater achievement levels than those in the
   opposite situations.},

Abstract = {The use of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) in years 9 and 10 classrooms
   as a tool to support learning or in preparation for senior secondary
   mathematics is controversial. This paper presents an analysis of the
   positive and negative aspects of using CAS identified in the literature
   related to these year levels, along with the perceptions of 12
   experienced secondary teachers who were working with years 9 and 10
   students. The literature review shows that CAS is valued for calculation
   and manipulation capabilities, the option of alternative
   representations, the opportunity for systematic exploration and for
   prompting rich discussion. However, the technical overhead, initial
   workload for the teacher and unresolved questions about the perceived
   relative contribution of machine and by-hand work to learning currently
   pose obstacles to teaching with CAS in the middle secondary years. The
   teachers who contributed data to this study perceived that using CAS in
   their teaching is, on balance, worth the effort. However, they believed
   that CAS is of most benefit to their high ability students and may
   present an obstacle to their low ability students' learning of
   mathematics.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 29},
Abstract = {Language as a cultural element influences Aboriginal pupils' mathematic
   performance. This study examines the utility of oral test in native
   language for computation and word problem mathematics items using score
   comparability. The sample includes 230 Grade 5 Orang Asli pupils from
   eight Malaysian primary schools in two states. By employing
   equipercentile linking using RAGE-RGEQUATE, the oral mathematics test
   was easier and more helpful, especially in native language for word
   problem items. The oral mathematics test is a valid measure for Orang
   Asli pupils in capturing their mathematical ability by reducing language
   as an erroneous secondary construct while assessing the primary
   dimension, which is mathematics knowledge. In addition, incorporating
   Aboriginal pupils' cultural elements can mitigate their challenges in
   learning Western mathematics.},

Abstract = {The expectations within higher education to improve online STEM courses
   have continued to increase. The pressure to do so particularly pertains
   to the lower-level introductory courses that act as gatekeeping courses
   to various STEM-related majors. Rather than working alone to improve
   their courses, more instructors for these courses pair with the
   respective instructional designers at their institutions to refresh or
   revise, their online courses. This study examines the revisions of a
   two-part introduction-to-biology series of online courses with their
   respective online labs over the span of three years, and from a sampling
   of 905 students, compares the final scores from the courses and the labs
   between each iteration. Findings indicate that multiple iterations of a
   course have the potential to increase student outcomes and to decrease
   the student dropout rate over time. Additionally, purely online students
   can perform differently in response to course revisions in comparison to
   the online students who also enroll in non-online courses, implying that
   the needs of online-only students may differ from those who have a
   blended learning experience.},

Title = {Affecting Task Values, Costs, and Effort in University Mathematics
   Courses: the Role of Profession-Related Tasks on Motivational and
   Behavioral States},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 2},
Abstract = {Expectancy-value models assume that task values play an important role
   in engaging successfully with the learning content. However, teacher
   education students in mathematics only value tasks that deal with
   university mathematics to a low degree. Offering students
   profession-related tasks that uncover the connection between university
   mathematics and school mathematics might help increase students' value
   beliefs and effort and decrease costs. Based on Eccles and Wigfield's
   (2020) situated expectancy-value theory and using a sample of 133
   teacher education students, we investigate whether offering
   profession-related tasks affects task values, costs, and effort for
   students with different levels of interest in school mathematics. In a
   within-subject design, students rated their task values, costs, and
   effort to solve seven mathematical tasks from number theory, which were
   either a profession-related task or a regular task with equal demands
   regarding the intended mathematical activities. Students reported higher
   utility value for their professional life, higher intrinsic value, and
   lower costs regarding profession-related tasks. No main effects were
   found for students' effort. However, students with a higher interest in
   school mathematics reported higher effort concerning profession-related
   tasks than regular tasks. On the theoretical level, our findings
   contribute to the discussion of the interplay between personal (i.e.
   interest) and task-specific factors (i.e. relation to future profession)
   for task values, costs, and effort in university mathematics. One
   important practical implication of our study is the recommendation to
   include profession-related tasks in university mathematics courses for
   teacher education students.},

Title = {How Students Construct Sophisticated Differential Equations to Model
   Real-World Contexts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 29},
Abstract = {Differential equations (DEs) are a powerful tool for modeling real-world
   contexts. Most research in this area has examined students'
   understanding and reasoning with pre-packaged DEs, with little attention
   being given to setting up sophisticated DEs to model complicated
   real-world situations. This study contributes through a collective case
   study on how individual students constructed DEs for various real-world
   systems, including a mechanical, a hydraulic, and an electrical system.
   We examined the students' readouts (how they ``read{''} a context),
   their inferential nets (inferences across knowledge resources), and
   their strategies (what guided their work), according to coordination
   class theory. Our study contributes the foundation of a knowledge base
   in students' DE modeling that further research and teaching work can
   build on.},

Abstract = {Elementary students demonstrate conflicts when measuring with rulers as
   well as measuring with discrete units. Their conflicts often lie in
   their focus on counting tick marks or focusing on the endpoint of
   objects on rulers or ignoring spaces with discrete units. In this study,
   we also investigated another area of conflict: students' conceptions on
   where measurements should start on a ruler. Across two time points, 32
   first graders and 37 third graders responded to a series of measurement
   tasks in the form of incorrect worked examples meant to expose students
   to these common conflicts of where the measurement starts and how to
   determine the overall length. Although students often said the objects
   should start at one, they were more likely to indicate that the object
   should be aligned with zero the closer the object was positioned to
   zero. However, many students said starting at the edge of the ruler
   (before zero) was okay, effectively equating the edge with either zero
   or one. Interestingly, on two related worked examples, their continuous
   and discrete measurements were not associated with each other. The
   incorrect worked examples helped illustrate important areas for further
   instruction, especially around their conceptions of rulers' edges and
   the impact of spaces with discrete units.},

Abstract = {Use of modeling as a learning strategy in introductory science courses
   could serve to support the persistence of all students, including those
   who identify with a traditionally underrepresented ethnic minority
   (URM). If students find inherent value in working on modeling-type
   problems then this authentic practice would aid in transforming personal
   interest into longer-term career-related beliefs, improving persistence.
   Yet research supporting this conjecture is negligible. Using Expectancy
   Value Theory, we compared the motivational beliefs of first-year
   engineering majors for different chemistry problem types and described a
   predictive model for modeling-type problems. We hypothesized that
   students' task value for different problem types would be influenced by
   gender, previous experience, and URM status and that previous or ongoing
   experiences would serve as a precursor for positive value judgments. The
   research design involved a correlational, single-case method. Data were
   analyzed using a mixed model analysis of variance and multiple linear
   regression. Overall, participants found modeling-type problems
   interesting and useful. However, our regression model revealed that URM
   status was a significant negative predictor of task value where these
   students were uninterested in modeling-type problems. However, an
   experience with a special modeling laboratory course completely changed
   the interest of URM students, suggesting the potential for modeling as
   an equitable instructional strategy for building persistence.},

Abstract = {It is important to cultivate dispositions of 21st-century skills (D21S:
   critical thinking, complex problem solving, creativity, communication,
   and collaboration) in project-based science, technology, engineering,
   and mathematics learning (STEM-PjBL). Previous research has seldom
   adopted the person-oriented approach to examine STEM-PjBL program
   effectiveness, and knowledge regarding group differences is still
   lacking. To fill this gap, a person-oriented analysis was used to form
   groupings of students based on D21S. Three latent profiles (high-,
   medium-, and low-D21S) of students were identified in 6 elementary
   schools, and the transition probabilities were estimated for 2 class
   types (treatment vs. comparison) across 1 semester. Most of the students
   (63.4\%) showed stable D21S profiles over 1 semester; however, some
   students (17.6\%) exhibited improvement, and some (18.9\%) showed
   declination. Additionally, the STEM-PjBL programs presented positive
   effects on the growth of D21S. This study further found that the D21S
   transitional types (i.e. declined, stable, and improved) could predict
   students' motivation (perceived STEM domain content mastery,
   self-efficacy, and task value), showing that a declined D21S also
   decreased academic motivation. The findings suggest that students who
   decline in D21S should receive attention from teachers because their
   perceived academic performance, competence beliefs, and values in STEM
   also decrease simultaneously.},

Abstract = {Emotions play an essential role in educational processes. Previous
   research has mainly dealt with achievement emotions which are
   experienced in specific situations such as exams or learning situations
   in mathematics (e.g. enjoyment or anxiety). Some achievement emotions
   are rather experienced in social contexts in mathematics and are closely
   related to the self. These emotions such as shame are assumed to be also
   relevant for mathematics achievement. However, a reliable and valid
   instrument is missing to measure shame in mathematics. Validity evidence
   for the newly developed Shame in Mathematics Questionnaire (SHAME-Q) was
   collected in three studies with pre-service primary teachers. Study 1
   investigated the content validity by conducting a systematic expert
   panel study. Study 2 and study 3 examined with two different samples the
   factorial structure and relations to other constructs in terms of
   discriminant (enjoyment) and convergent (anxiety) validity as well as to
   pre-service teachers' grade in school mathematics, their intention to
   teach mathematics at school, and gender. The data supported strongly the
   validity assumptions as well as reliability and parsimony of the
   instrument. Psychometric limitations of SHAME-Q and applicability of the
   questionnaire are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study integrated environmental issues as the initial problem to
   explore the process of problem-solving of high school students and
   proposes the concept of environmental problem-solving (EPS) to probe the
   interaction between high school students' scientific performance and EPS
   strategies. There were 139 high school students in Taiwan who
   participated in this study. Participants were required to complete the
   ``Environmental Literacy Scale,{''} ``Environmental Scientific
   Achievement Questionnaire,{''} and ``Environmental Problem-Solving
   Process Questionnaire.{''} The result showed that the students with
   higher scores in environmental scientific achievement got higher scores
   in the EPS process as well. However, the students with higher scores in
   environmental literacy were able to proffer better EPS strategies,
   analyze EPS solutions incisively, and present multiple plans. Further
   discussion is provided.},

Abstract = {Tasks that require students to construct examples that meet certain
   constraints are frequently used in mathematics education. Although
   examples do not serve as proofs for general statements, they have a
   supporting role in the preliminary stages of making sense of a certain
   mathematical phenomenon as well as in the development of argumentation.
   We hypothesize that examples of the limit-confirming type could also
   support the initiation of arguments for refuting an existential claim.
   Although students may be able to construct this type of example, they
   rarely use it effectively in their argumentation. In this qualitative
   study, we analyze how teachers could scaffold students' awareness of the
   potential role of limit-confirming examples as tools for supporting
   argumentative processes and reflections on methods of construction of
   effective examples. We analyzed teacher's actions to explain and
   generalize this process by identifying and categorizing key moments that
   could characterize an approach fostering students' aware and effective
   use of examples to develop argumentations.},

Abstract = {Mathematical modeling is a high-leverage topic, critical for college and
   career readiness, participation in STEM education, and civic engagement.
   Mathematical modeling involves connecting real-world situations,
   phenomenon, and/or data with mathematical models, and in this way
   applies across various STEM disciplines, including mathematics,
   engineering, and science. Although research has begun to explore
   mathematical modeling instruction in the elementary grades, questions
   remain about how to assess student learning at the elementary level. We
   addressed this need by designing an assessment of mathematical modeling
   competencies for students in grades 3 through 5. Informed by
   international research, our assessment includes a hybrid structure to
   assess mathematical modeling competencies holistically (as students
   engage in the complete modeling process) and atomistically (as students
   engage in different components of the modeling process, including making
   sense of phenomena and real-world situations, setting up and operating
   on mathematical models, and interpreting results in relation to the
   real-world context). We conducted student interviews, followed by two
   rounds of pilot testing to inform item development and ensure acceptable
   psychometric properties. The final assessment included 13 items (9
   multiple choice, 3 open-response, and 1 complete modeling task). We
   describe our assessment development process, and provide sample
   assessment items and detailed coding rubrics. We summarize quantitative
   analyses which established high reliability and low standard error for
   our assessment, supporting its use for grades 3 to 5. Implications of
   our framework and assessment for mathematical modeling instruction and
   future research on STEM learning are discussed.},

Abstract = {Nanoscience and nanotechnology (NST) focus on the creation and the
   exploration of materials' properties at the nanoscale. The estimations
   about the impact of the field on our daily life, the industrial demands
   for ensuring skilled workforce, and the need to form a nano-literate
   citizenry have triggered the incorporation of aspects of this
   cutting-edge field into school curricula on behalf of education
   researchers. Teachers play a vital role in the success of this endeavor.
   However, only a few studies up to date examine teachers' ideas of this
   field. In addition, there is not any analysis tool that would provide
   insights about how teachers' ideas are related to the key concepts and
   principles of NST. Concerning this gap, we describe in detail a
   deductive content analysis method, having been conducted to examine the
   meanings that 419 Greek primary school teachers give to NST. Results
   reveal the insufficient content knowledge of primary school teachers
   regarding NST.},

Abstract = {Research exploring undergraduates' tool preferences in tertiary
   mathematics is currently limited. In this paper, we explore the tools
   mathematics and engineering students use when studying mathematics and
   the ways undergraduates combine these tools. Results from our survey (N
   = 628) showed that students in our sample use mostly their notes, the
   university's virtual learning environment (VLE), other students and
   textbooks. Mathematics students were found using more online
   encyclopaedias, the university's VLE, instant messaging and other
   students, whereas engineering students reported using more textbooks. By
   performing a cluster analysis, undergraduates were assigned to five
   distinct tool-use profiles: the peer-learning group (above average use
   of other students, instant messaging apps and social media); the
   online-learning group (above average use of online videos, online
   encyclopaedias, Wolfram Alpha and the university's VLE); the
   blended-learning group (above average use of all the tools at their
   disposal); the no-users group (below average use of all tools except
   textbooks); and the selective-learning group (above average use of
   textbooks, online videos and lecturers). The majority of mathematics
   students were distributed across the peer-learning, online-learning and
   blended-learning groups, whereas most of the engineering students were
   found in the blended-learning, no-users and selective-learning groups.},

Abstract = {Success in problem-based learning requires both strong information
   literacy to search for, evaluate, and use information effectively, and
   argumentation skills to generate coherent arguments. This study
   investigated the positive and negative effects of computer-based
   scaffolding to support high-school credit recovery students' information
   literacy and argumentation skills in a problem-based learning unit on
   air quality. Virtual field trips and the Connection Log were designed
   and developed to provide scaffolding that supported students in
   addressing conceptual, metacognitive, and strategic challenges. Results
   revealed that diverse students can use scaffolding in different ways on
   the basis of distinct goals and prior experiences. These findings imply
   that information literacy and argumentation skills supported by
   computer-based scaffolding are pivotal factors in problem-based learning
   for science education.},

Abstract = {There has been a growing awareness that graphing is an essential part of
   the science curriculum. While much research has focused on student
   conceptions and abilities regarding graphical representations, only few
   studies have investigated what teachers think about them and how they
   use graphs in science class. The purpose of this study is to explore
   educational beliefs, motivation, and teaching practices of German
   secondary biology teachers regarding graph construction. Via
   questionnaire surveys, 71 teachers from different regions in Germany
   rated their beliefs and motivation as well as the frequency of different
   graph construction activities in biology class. The teachers surveyed in
   this study were quite motivated in their teaching of graph construction.
   Furthermore, they tended to believe that graph construction should be
   practiced explicitly in biology class and that students should learn
   clear strategies for constructing graphs. We found that teaching
   subjects and own research experience make a difference in teachers'
   beliefs and motivation regarding graph construction in biology class.
   The self-report on classroom practices revealed that participants may
   provide limited opportunities for students to experience graphing as a
   social and iterative practice. Implications are drawn for teacher
   education and professional development as well as for further research
   in teacher education contexts.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to construct a STEM competencies assessment
   framework and provide validity evidence by empirically testing its
   structure. Common interdisciplinary assessment frameworks for STEM seem
   to be scarce in the literature. Many studies use students' mathematics
   or science scores obtained from large-scale assessments or exams to
   assess STEM achievement. In the current framework, the multidimensional
   and integrated structure of the STEM competencies was addressed by
   taking into account science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
   domains. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-related
   problems that required mathematical calculations were used as a medium
   to develop an assessment tool for this framework. A test was developed
   based on this assessment framework and items were calibrated using the
   item response theory. We tested the structure of the framework through
   confirmatory factor analysis by collecting data from 8th grade students.
   The empirical findings supported the structure of the STEM assessment
   framework.},

Abstract = {This study deals with the academic identities of 13 female Arab students
   upon their entrance to STEM studies in a university in Israel. Female
   Arab students in a predominantly Jewish Israeli engineering institution
   face conflicting narratives regarding their ethnicity, gender, and its
   relation to possible success in university-level studies in general and
   mathematical studies in particular. To exemplify this, we focus on two
   students, Lena and Mira, who both encountered difficulties upon entering
   the institute, yet of different kinds. While Mira was mostly preoccupied
   with ethnic and religious conflictual narratives, Lena was occupied with
   gender-inferiority narratives. We use the concepts of current and
   designated identities and space of authorship within figured worlds to
   explain how different conflictual narratives permeated the identities of
   the two students. At the same time, we relate the findings from the two
   case studies to the more general findings from the 13 participants of
   the study.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to understand behavioral characteristics
   of creative physicists during their growth period, and we want to use
   any insight gained to help teachers and parents encourage students'
   creativity in their everyday life. To do this, the critical incident
   technique was utilized to extract behavioral traits from six physicists
   through the study of literature. As a result, 210 cases were extracted
   and summarized in the form of a list consisting of eight categories and
   30 statements. A high degree of validity was obtained through a survey
   of experts and science teachers who had experiences in gifted education.
   By applying the developed list to eighteen science high school students,
   high reliability was obtained through the analysis of Cronbach alpha,
   Cohens' kappa, and correlations between two evaluators. Results of this
   study revealed that students showed various aspects of the extracted
   behavioral characteristics evenly. However, evaluation scores differed
   between individuals; thus, it might be possible to use the list as a
   scientific creativity test tool. Finally, this study discussed various
   potential applications of the list along with its limitations.},

Abstract = {The present study attempted to replicate the previous results of Hu et
   al. (Learning and Instruction 35:85-93 2015) and further examined the
   boundary condition of tracing gesture whether its cognitive effect is
   merely comparable with other attention-guiding means, i.e., textual
   attention cueing, in two different learning tasks in nature. In two
   experiments, 11- to 13-year-old students were asked to study the worked
   examples on angles relationships involving parallel lines (experiment 1)
   and laws of exponents (experiment 2) either without tracing instruction,
   with textual attention cueing instruction, or tracing instruction. The
   tracing group outperformed the other two groups on a subsequent test and
   reported lower levels of test difficulty in experiment 1 but not in
   experiment 2, suggesting that the cognitive effect of tracing gesture
   was beyond guiding attention in the learning from highly
   visuospatial-based worked examples but not in the materials that are
   less obviously visuospatial in nature. The present findings suggested
   that tracing gesture offers a simple yet effective embodied technique
   that may further enhance the worked example-based learning through its
   cognitive effect specifically on the task involved with spatial
   information.},

Abstract = {Motivation for an action is determined by the expectation for success
   and subjective judgment on task values according to the expectancy-value
   theory. Task values, including intrinsic value, attainment value,
   utility value, and cost, influence and predict the students' engagement
   in learning activities and their choices in the future. This study
   validated the science, mathematics, and English task value scales using
   a longitudinal data. Data were collected from the 1234 middle school
   students of different school types, sizes, and districts in the Taipei
   metropolitan area. Confirmatory factor analysis, invariance, explanatory
   power, and higher order factor analysis were used to test the
   reliability and validity of the Chinese version across the three
   repeated annual collections of data and to develop a short version. The
   results showed that both the long and short task value scales are valid
   and reliable for measuring in-depth task values for different subjects,
   grades, and for long-term study. From seventh to ninth grade, the
   students' science task values decrease, the English task values are
   relatively stable, and the mathematics task values improve in Grade 8,
   but then decline in Grade 9. The implications of the scales for
   monitoring, intervening, and enhancing the students' task values are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The aim of the current study was to investigate the statistical literacy
   of seventh grade students regarding the concepts of average and
   variation on bar and line graphs presented in alternative real-life
   contexts. To this end, the statistical literacy levels of the seventh
   grade students were initially determined. Subsequently, definitions,
   interpretations and evaluations generated by the students at varying
   levels of statistical literacy were examined in further depth. More
   specifically, a qualitative survey study was conducted with 164 seventh
   graders from two public middle schools in Ankara, Turkey. The data,
   collected by means of a-five-item instrument, were analyzed by utilizing
   the modified version of the six-hierarchical-level framework developed
   by Watson and Callingham (Statistics Education Research Journal, 2(2),
   3-46, 2003). The findings revealed that most of the students'
   statistical literacy levels were identified as either Level 3 or Level 4
   in the framework with respect to the concept of average, and either
   Level 1 or Level 2 with respect to the concept of variation. Hence, it
   can be inferred that while many of the students could interpret average
   in the given contexts, they had difficulty in interpreting variation.
   Although definitions and evaluations related to both concepts were found
   difficult by seventh graders, the graphs, particularly bar graphs, which
   students were provided with, were observed to be helpful for students in
   their evaluation of variation. Additionally, students benefitted from
   some of the contexts they were provided while evaluating variation.
   Finally, the analysis revealed some discrepancies among students'
   definitions and their interpretations or evaluations.},

Abstract = {Temperature and heat are difficult concepts for children to grasp due to
   their abstractness. An image-to-writing approach, guided by the
   visualisation practices of scientists, was designed to engage elementary
   students with constructing images to represent their ideas about
   phenomena and translating these images into text using scientific
   terminologies. Taking a quasi-experimental approach, the experimental
   group students received inquiry-based instruction based on the
   image-to-writing approach, while the control group students received a
   mix of direct instruction and inquiry activities without explicit focus
   on multimodal representations. An instrument consisting of four free
   response questions was developed and administered to 129 primary 4
   students (aged 9-10) before (pre-test) and after (post-test) instruction
   to determine their conceptual understanding and representational
   competences. ANCOVA showed that students in the experimental group
   perform significantly better than those in the control group in their
   conceptual understanding. Further analysis revealed that a larger
   percentage of students in the experimental group demonstrated higher
   levels of conceptual understanding after instruction, compared to the
   control group for more complex phenomena, even though both groups showed
   similar levels of representational competences. The findings suggest
   that an image-to-writing approach can help students develop deeper
   conceptual understanding as well as use representations to demonstrate
   their conceptual understanding. The use of images could have helped
   students in their thinking and learning of complex phenomena, which
   allowed them to better convey their understanding of the concepts.},

Abstract = {Logical reasoning is of great societal importance and, as stressed by
   the twenty-first century skills framework, also seen as a key aspect for
   the development of critical thinking. This study aims at exploring
   secondary school students' logical reasoning strategies in formal
   reasoning and everyday reasoning tasks. With task-based interviews among
   4 16- and 17-year-old pre-university students, we explored their
   reasoning strategies and the reasoning difficulties they encounter. In
   this article, we present results from linear ordering tasks, tasks with
   invalid syllogisms and a task with implicit reasoning in a newspaper
   article. The linear ordering tasks and the tasks with invalid syllogisms
   are presented formally (with symbols) and non-formally in ordinary
   language (without symbols). In tasks that were familiar to our students,
   they used rule-based reasoning strategies and provided correct answers
   although their initial interpretation differed. In tasks that were
   unfamiliar to our students, they almost always used informal
   interpretations and their answers were influenced by their own
   knowledge. When working on the newspaper article task, the students did
   not use strong formal schemes, which could have provided a clear
   overview. At the end of the article, we present a scheme showing which
   reasoning strategies are used by students in different types of tasks.
   This scheme might increase teachers' awareness of the variety in
   reasoning strategies and can guide classroom discourse during courses on
   logical reasoning. We suggest that using suitable formalisations and
   visualisations might structure and improve students' reasoning as well.},

Abstract = {Attention to mathematical reasoning in curriculum standards is part of
   an international trend, but identifying and understanding reasoning
   continues to challenge teachers.We report on one component of an
   Australia-wide initiative supporting teachers to implement innovative
   pedagogies. This paper contains insights from design research that
   focused on trialling classroom materials to support elementary teachers
   in their planning and assessment of mathematical reasoning. Findings
   confirmed planning is a critical step to developing learning experiences
   that elicit student reasoning, including consideration to task
   modifications and teacher questioning. Teachers' capacity to assess
   their students' reasoning was explored using the purposefully designed
   Assessing Mathematical Reasoning Rubric. The results reveal the
   complexity involved in constructing accurate judgements of students'
   reasoning capabilities, particularly appreciating the non-linear nature
   of mathematical reasoning and the need to draw on multiple sources of
   evidence. Implications for supporting teachers in their planning for,
   and assessing of, mathematical reasoning are raised.},

Title = {A Case Study Exploring Non-dominant Youths' Attitudes Toward Science
   Through Making and Scientific Argumentation},

Abstract = {The purposes of this qualitative case study were to describe the design
   and the development of a maker-centered learning environment and
   curriculum by an interdisciplinary team, and to explore how an
   after-school program that incorporated Maker education and scientific
   argumentation influenced middle school youths' attitudes toward science
   in the Midwestern USA. The researchers conducted pre- and
   post-interviews with six students from non-dominant backgrounds and the
   teacher, and also administered attitudinal surveys to the six students
   at two time points (pre/post). Additionally, the researchers
   video-recorded each after-school session, observed the level of student
   participation in each activity, and examined student artifacts. At the
   end of the program, the researchers administered a program survey to the
   six students. The findings revealed a number of themes. This
   after-school program eased the tension from the formal science learning
   with the playful qualities of Making activities and developed the
   students' practice of social negotiation, which sustained their liking
   of science. The Making and scientific argumentation activities provided
   an opportunity to contextualize STEM concepts and practices, which
   allowed the students to value science by re-affirming as well as
   expanding their career choices. The Making and scientific argumentation
   activities helped boost confidence that, up to that point, had been
   decreasing in formal science learning contexts. The findings speak to
   the need for future studies that investigate pedagogy issues in Making
   after-school programs and also examine equity issues in the
   opportunities for non-dominant youth to participate in these programs.},

Title = {Comparing Likert Scale Functionality Across Culturally and
   Linguistically Diverse Groups in Science Education Research: an
   Illustration Using Qatari Students' Responses to an Attitude Toward

Abstract = {Surveying is a common methodology in science education research,
   including cross-national and cross-cultural comparisons. The literature
   surrounding students' attitudes toward science, in particular,
   illustrates the prevalence of efforts to translate instruments with the
   eventual goal of comparing groups. This paper utilizes survey data from
   a nationally representative cross-sectional study of Qatari students in
   grades 3 through 12 to frame a discussion around the adequacy and extent
   to which common adaptations allow comparisons to be made among
   linguistically or culturally different respondents. The analytic sample
   contained 2615 students who responded to a previously validated 32-item
   instrument, 1704 of whom completed the survey in Modern Standard Arabic
   and 911 in English. The purpose of using these data is to scrutinize
   variation in the performance of the instrument between groups of
   respondents as determined by language of survey completion and cultural
   heritage. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was employed to
   investigate issues of validity associated with the performance of the
   survey with each group and to evaluate the appropriateness of using this
   instrument to make simultaneous comparisons across the distinct groups.
   Findings underscore the limitations of group comparability that may
   persist even when issues of translation and adaptation were heavily
   attended to during instrument development.},

Abstract = {Task design is increasingly recognised as crucial for enhancing student
   learning of mathematics. Even so, and despite the significance of
   mathematical activity related to proofs and counterexamples in school
   mathematics, the task design principles underpinning students' success
   in proof-related activity remains under-explored in mathematics
   education research. What is more, although the affordances of using
   dynamic geometry environments (DGEs) have been established in the
   literature, task design in DGEs remains somewhat under-studied. In this
   paper, we address both these issues by theoretically developing, and
   empirically testing, task design principles for supporting students'
   heuristic refutation (revising conjectures/proofs through addressing
   counterexamples) in DGEs. We use the existing literature to elaborate
   three design principles: using tasks whose conditions are purposefully
   implicit, providing tools that enhance the production of
   counterexamples, and increasing students' recognition of contradictions.
   To test these principles empirically, we analyse two sets of task-based
   interviews, one with a triad of secondary school students and the other
   with a pair of undergraduates, where tasks designed according to the
   principles were implemented. Our analysis shows that using the tasks
   enabled the students to engage successfully in heuristic refutation. The
   matter of examining mathematical definitions when handling
   counterexamples emerged as an issue for further research.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study is to examine content knowledge (CK)
   and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of Greek teachers in number
   sense and specifically in mental calculations with rational numbers
   (fractions, decimals and percentages). Examined within the framework of
   CK were the type of strategies employed by teachers and the extent of
   the repertoire of these strategies, which provides an indication of
   their flexibility. Teachers' CK performance in mental calculations with
   rational numbers was compared with the extent of their strategic
   repertoire as well as with the PCK they employed when teaching mental
   calculations with rational numbers. The data revealed that the teachers'
   high CK performance in mental calculations with rational numbers is
   positively influenced by the existence of an extensive strategic
   repertoire. Furthermore, it was found that a high CK performance and an
   extensive strategic repertoire in mental calculations with rational
   numbers positively influence the PCK of mental calculations with
   rational numbers.},

Abstract = {This study adopted a researcher-generated framework to analyze STEM
   activities demonstrated in primary students' science projects in an
   annual extracurricular event held in Hong Kong. Ten students' project
   reports were randomly selected from each of the three groups of 24
   outstanding, 45 merit, and 68 consolation awarded projects. Content
   analysis was conducted to code the activities in each project. The coded
   information was then changed into numerical data for quantitative
   analysis. The results showed that, in general, more engineering and
   science activities than technology and mathematics activities were
   adopted by the primary students in their projects. More projects with
   the Outstanding Award conducted STEM activities than those projects with
   Merit and Consolation Awards, and significant group differences existed
   in the science and mathematics activities. Besides, science activities
   significantly positively related to engineering and mathematics
   activities. Furthermore, STEM-related content knowledge of discipline
   core ideas and crosscutting concepts were reported. This study sheds
   light on the pattern of STEM activities in students' science projects,
   and has implications for promoting STEM integration in primary
   education.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between adult self-efficacy in
   science and scientific competencies of Taiwanese citizens. Probability
   proportional to size sampling was used to select 1830 participants
   between the ages of 18 and 70. The research methods employed was survey
   research; analysis was conducted using hierarchical regression analysis.
   The results indicated that gender and self-efficacy have an explanatory
   power for scientific competencies. The predictive power of self-efficacy
   for scientific competencies was different for male and female groups.
   This study proposes several suggestions regarding science education
   policies in accordance with the research findings.},

Abstract = {Model-eliciting activities are problem-solving activities that differ
   from traditional problems as they include non-routine, open-ended, and
   complicated real-life situations with various solutions (Lesh \& Doerr,
   2003). According to Lesh, Hoover, Hole, Kelly and Post (2000), a
   model-eliciting activity must follow certain principles, namely, the
   model construction, reality, self-evaluation, model externalization
   (construct certification), model generalization, and effective prototype
   principles. The aim of this study was to analyze on the basis of these
   principles the activities in a 9th grade mathematics course book
   prepared according to Turkey's new curriculum (Ministry of National
   Education {[}MoNE], 2013a). Data collection comprised document analysis
   and the data were analyzed using content analysis. The results showed
   that 16 out of 73 activities in the course book were model-eliciting
   activities. Such model-eliciting activities appeared mainly in the
   ``Equations and Inequalities{''} unit, and none were found in the
   ``Congruency and Similarity of Triangles{''} and ``Right Angled Triangle
   and Trigonometry; Area of Triangles and Vectors{''} units. The analysis
   also showed that none of the model-eliciting activities in the course
   book followed all the model-eliciting activity principles, and only 5
   followed the self-evaluation and model externalization principles
   partially and the remaining principles fully. As a result, the course
   book is quantitatively rich, but qualitatively inadequate in terms of
   principle-based model-eliciting activities. However, certain
   model-eliciting activities in the course book can be improved into a
   model-eliciting activity meeting the requirements of all principles.
   These findings lead to a recommendation that the 9th grade course book
   be revised in terms of the modeling activities involved.},

Title = {The Cooperative Classroom Environment Measure (CCEM): Refining a Measure
   that Assesses Factors Motivating Student Prosociality},

Abstract = {A classroom's social environment and student dispositions towards social
   interaction together exert a substantial influence on academic outcomes.
   The strength of this effect is highlighted by research showing the
   positive effect of cooperative learning on student achievement, but can
   also be seen in the contribution that student social dispositions,
   specifically one's disposition toward helping others (i.e. prosocial),
   has on individual achievement. The current study sought to assess the
   psychometric properties of the original Cooperative Classroom
   Environment Measure (CCEM) and refine the measure to increase its
   validity for use in the classroom. The CCEM was developed to provide
   information to educators about factors in the classroom environment
   contributing to student prosociality. The original form was answered by
   431 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory life science
   class. Following data collection, both exploratory factor analysis (EFA)
   and Rasch analysis were used to remove problematic items and generate a
   refined form. The psychometric properties of this refined form were
   examined using Rasch and confirmatory factor analysis, and supported the
   presence of six (out of eight originally hypothesized) subscale
   constructs analogous to those influencing prosociality in other
   contexts. Additional evidence showed the presence of a single prominent
   underlying latent factor (termed Prosocial) that could account for
   significant variance in all subscale constructs. These findings provided
   preliminary evidence for the use of both the CCEM subscales and whole
   survey measures for investigations into optimizing classroom social
   environments for prosocial action.},

Abstract = {A 14-week course program was designed to investigate pre-service
   teachers' noticing skills and scaffolding practices. Six pre-service
   teachers were matched with a pair of sixth grade students to observe and
   scaffold students' mathematical understanding while they were working on
   the given tasks. Data was collected through pre-service teachers' own
   recorded videos of implementation of tasks, their written reflections
   about the implementations, videos of group reflections before and after
   the implementations, and students' written work. The analysis of data
   revealed that pre-service teachers mostly noticed students' errors and
   strategies during their interactions with students, they attended
   important instances about students' thinking and justified their
   reasoning for their comments in their written reflections. However,
   while interacting with students, they usually used low level scaffolding
   practices such as asking for clarification, explanation, and
   justification rather than attempting to elicit students' thinking and
   improve their understanding.},

Title = {The Importance of Multiple Representations of Mathematical Problems:
   Evidence from Chinese Preservice Elementary Teachers' Analysis of a
   Learning Goal},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {This article describes a study of how Chinese preservice teachers
   unpacked a learning goal pertaining to adding fractions and
   understanding the concepts underlying the operation. Based on work in
   the USA by Morris, Hiebert, and Spizter (Journal for Research in
   Mathematics Education, 40(5), 491-529, 2009), 50 Chinese preservice
   teachers completed a task, anticipating an ideal student response, in
   the context of four representations: (1) fraction pieces, (2) graph
   paper, (3) common denominator algorithm, and (4) pennies. Like the
   US-based study, this study shows that Chinese preservice teachers'
   ability to unpack a learning goal was highly influenced by how the
   problem was represented. The pennies and graph paper problems provided
   more supportive contexts for unpacking the learning goal; the algorithm
   problem provided the least supportive context. The main difference
   between the preservice teachers from these two countries was the US
   preservice teachers chose the pennies and graph paper problems as having
   the most potential for revealing students' understanding of the learning
   goal; while the Chinese preservice teachers chose the algorithm problem
   despite the problem's unsupportive context. Chinese preservice teachers'
   preference suggests that they privileged algorithmic/symbolic
   representations over pictorial/concrete representations. Based on our
   results, we argue that it is time for cross-cultural comparative
   research to refocus on the common barriers, challenges, and benefits as
   related to mathematics teacher preparation and professional development.
   A cooperative instead of competitive orientation will lead to richer and
   deeper dialogues among mathematics educators.},

Title = {Conceptions, Self-Regulation, and Strategies of Learning Science Among

Abstract = {This study explored the structural relationships among secondary school
   students' conceptions, self-regulation, and strategies of learning
   science in mainland China. Three questionnaires, namely conceptions of
   learning science (COLS), self-regulation of learning science (SROLS),
   and strategies of learning science (SLS) were developed for
   investigating 333 Chinese high school learners' conceptions,
   metacognitive self-regulation, and strategies in science. The
   confirmatory factor analysis results verified the validity of the three
   surveys. Moreover, the path analyses revealed a series of interesting
   findings. Learners with lower-level COLS, namely ``memorizing,{''}
   ``testing,{''} and ``practicing and calculating,{''} tended to use
   surface learning strategies such as ``minimizing scope of the study{''}
   and ``rote learning.{''} However, learners' higher-level COLS, namely
   ``increase of knowledge,{''} ``applying,{''} ``understanding,{''} and
   ``seeing in a new way,{''} had complicated connections with their SROLS
   and SLS. On the one hand, learners' higher-level COLS had negative
   relations to ``minimizing scope of the study{''} and ``rote
   learning.{''} On the other hand, their higher-level COLS were powerful
   predicators for their metacognitive self-regulation and further affected
   their use of ``deep strategy{''} and ``rote learning.{''} Though Chinese
   secondary students with higher-level COLS usually have a negative view
   of ``rote learning,{''} the functioning of their metacognitive
   self-regulation may change their initial attitudes towards the surface
   strategy. Learners with higher-level COLS still used ``rote learning{''}
   as a prior step for achieving deep learning. Therefore, we concluded
   that the SROLS played an important mediating role between the COLS and
   SLS and may change learners' original intention to utilize learning
   strategies.},

Abstract = {The purposes of this study are to report the influences of a mixed
   delivery professional development {[}PD] course involving face-to-face
   classes and the mentoring assisted inquiry-based teaching {[}MAIT]
   website that addressed the conceptual change and self-efficacy of high
   school mathematics and science teachers' conceptions of inquiry-based
   teaching. Twenty-five in-service high school science and mathematics
   teachers participated in a 9 weeks, 4 h per week PD course. Data
   collection included the pre-post Inquiry Teaching Efficacy Questionnaire
   {[}ITEQ], teachers' reflective journals posted on the MAIT website,
   teachers' assignments requested by the course instructor, and follow-up
   teachers' interviews. Findings revealed that both mathematics and
   science teachers' conceptions of inquiry teaching show significant
   improvements after the course. The mixed delivery PD course had the same
   influence on science and mathematics teachers. The authentic video clips
   and lesson plans provided on the MAIT website and the specific feedback
   toward teachers' performance are the main factors that shaped teachers'
   inquiry-based teaching conceptions.},

Abstract = {This study offers a view on students' technology-based problem solving
   activity through the lens of a theoretical model which accounts for the
   relationship between mathematical and technological knowledge in
   successful problem solving. This study takes a qualitative approach
   building on the work of a 13-year-old girl as an exemplary case of the
   nature of young students' spontaneous mathematical problem solving with
   technology. The empirical data comprise digital records of her
   approaches to two problems from a web-based mathematical competition
   where she resorted to GeoGebra and an interview where she explains and
   describes her usual problem solving activity with this tool. Based on a
   proposed model for describing the processes of mathematical problem
   solving with technologies (MPST), the main results show that this
   student's solving and expressing the solution are held from the early
   and continuing interplay between mathematical skills and the perception
   of the affordances of the tool. The analytical model offers a clear
   picture of the type of actions that lead to the solution of each
   problem, revealing the student's ability to deal with mathematics and
   technology in problem solving. By acknowledging this as a case of a
   human-with-media in solving mathematical problems, the students'
   efficient way of merging technological and mathematical knowledge is
   portrayed in terms of her techno-mathematical fluency.},

Abstract = {Although education experts are increasingly advocating the incorporation
   of integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
   curriculum units to address limitations in much current STEM teaching
   and learning, a review of the literature reveals that more often than
   not such curriculum units are not mediating the construction of in-depth
   STEM knowledge. In this paper, we conjecture that the challenge of
   generating integrated STEM curriculum units that overcome this
   limitation and facilitate in-depth learning of and about STEM can be met
   by the use of three types of big ideas: within-discipline big ideas that
   have application in other STEM disciplines, cross-discipline big ideas,
   and encompassing big ideas. We provide a six-component framework
   (together with an example of the framework in action) that can be used
   to scaffold pre- and in-service teachers' development of integrated STEM
   curriculum units based around these types of big ideas. The paper
   concludes by discussing possible directions for future research and
   development in this field.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the experiences of 37 physical science high school
   teachers who participated in a professional development (PD) programme
   coordinated by three Experimento multipliers. The Experimento programme
   is a Siemens Stiftung international educational programme aimed at
   providing didactic and methodological approaches to classroom
   experiments using an inquiry-based approach to science education.
   Experimento multipliers are the facilitators of the PD. The main data
   source comprised teacher interviews, school observation visits on
   classroom activities using the Experimento 10+ box and the facilitators'
   field notes. Findings suggest that there is a shift from the traditional
   approaches of science teaching to the implementation of inquiry-based
   teaching which was encouraged by the gradual formation of a community of
   practice, a reconceptualization of the term `practical activities' as
   prescribed by the CAPS document, and the need for experiments which
   facilitate action-oriented teaching. The discussion highlights the
   implications of these findings for the practicing teachers' professional
   development and the problems of linking theory with practice in such
   development. The study recommends more interventions throughout the year
   to enable teachers to improve their skills of implementing inquiry-based
   teaching, content knowledge and science pedagogy as evidenced by
   analysis of their summative evaluation of the intervention.},

Abstract = {Although the importance of language in science learning has been widely
   recognized by researchers, there is limited research on how science
   teachers perceive the roles that language plays in science classrooms.
   As part of an intervention design project that aimed to enhance
   teachers' capacity to address the language demands of science, interview
   data (N = 9) were collected to understand teachers' perceptions and
   experiences with a wide range of issues related to language use in
   science classrooms. Adopting an interpretive approach to qualitative
   data, the analysis revealed that the teachers perceive a wide range of
   student difficulties related to language use in science classrooms,
   especially to the use of specialized terms and writing. Although the
   teachers are keenly aware of how language can be a barrier to learning
   science, they are less certain as to what students need to know about
   the language of science in order to master it. The findings suggested
   professional support that highlights the distinctive language demands of
   science and how these demands differ from other subject areas could be
   useful to these elementary school teachers.},

Abstract = {Examples which are used in exploring a procedure or
   comprehending/concretizing a mathematical concept are powerful teaching
   tools. Generating examples other than conventional ones is both a means
   for research and a pedagogical method. The aim of this study is to
   determine the transition process between example generation strategies,
   and the factors affecting success of the students in generating examples
   in a Real Analysis course. The participants of the study consisted of 27
   undergraduate mathematics students. At the end of the study, it was
   observed that some of the participants used especially the trial and
   error strategy as an effective step in the transition to the
   transformation strategy. Definitions were used by participants as a
   trigger for example generation and to reflect on concepts during this
   process in order to reduce cognitive demand.},

Title = {ARE ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTIONS DEPENDENT ON RESEARCHERS' METHODOLOGY AND
   DEFINITION?: A REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES RELATED TO CONCEPTS OF HEAT},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {499-526},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Currently, there is no agreement among scientists and science educators
   on whether heat should be defined as a ``process of energy transfer{''}
   or ``form of energy.{''} For example, students may conceive of heat as
   ``molecular kinetic energy,{''} but the interpretation of this
   alternative conception is dependent on educational researchers'
   methodology and definition of heat. The objective of this paper is to
   review the alternative conceptions of heat as presented in empirical
   studies and to examine the possible sources of this subjectivity or
   causes of this problem. This paper analyzes the alternative conceptions
   of heat based on five categories: ``residing in object,{''}
   ``ontological category,{''} ``movement,{''} ``cause and effect,{''} and
   ``condition.{''} The findings suggest that it could be difficult to
   understand the alternative conceptions when there is disagreement on the
   definition or description of heat. Furthermore, alternative conceptions
   may be traceable to linguistic usage or definitions in textbooks.
   Therefore, it is possible to have a misinterpretation of students'
   alternative conceptions.},

Abstract = {Two studies were conducted for the development and validation of a
   multidimensional test to assess undergraduate students' mathematical
   thinking about derivative. The first study involved two phases: question
   generation and refinement of the Thinking-about-Derivative Test (TDT).
   The second study included four phases as follows: test administration,
   generalizability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and subgroup
   validity analysis. Findings suggested that the 30-item multiple-choice
   TDT, which comprises 6 mathematical thinking aspects, enactive, iconic,
   algorithmic, algebraic, formal, and axiomatic thinking, demonstrates
   acceptable levels of reliability and validity. Followed by additional
   cross-validation studies, the TDT may be a useful tool for mathematics
   education researchers and mathematicians. Directions for future research
   and implications for educational practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Large-scale studies measure mathematics-related affect using
   questionnaires developed by researchers in primarily English-based
   countries and according to Western-based theories. Influential
   comparative conclusions about different cultures and countries are drawn
   based on such measurements. However, there are certain premises involved
   in these kinds of ``imposed-etic approaches,{''} such as (1)
   universalism within the examined components, (2) universalism within the
   components' significances, (3) the congruence between languages and
   conceptions, and (4) the components' coverage of the phenomena.
   Therefore, researchers have criticized these premises citing a large
   number of reasons. In this study, the validity of conclusions based on
   results relying on the imposed-etic approach is questioned by examining
   to what extent the premises behind this approach can be justified. We
   investigate the premise of universality within the examined components
   by scrutinizing the limitations of a typical questionnaire. To what
   extent can such a questionnaire reveal affective domain structures for
   pupils in two countries as dissimilar as Finland and Chile? We found
   that there can be no meaningful precision. Universalism across
   components within the mathematics-related affect structure is not
   guaranteed in the two cultures, and the use of such questionnaires is
   simply unjustifiable. We also thoroughly examined the three other
   premises underpinning the Western-based imposed-etic perspective.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a model of numeracy that integrates the use of
   digital technologies among other elements of teaching and learning
   mathematics. Drawing on data from a school-based project, which includes
   records of classroom observations, semi-structured teacher interviews
   and artefacts such as student work samples, a classroom-based vignette
   is presented, which illustrates possibilities for technology integration
   into classroom numeracy practice. This vignette provides evidence of the
   influence of digital tools on students' development of skills,
   mathematical knowledge, dispositions and orientation towards using
   mathematics critically.},

Abstract = {We analyze the mathematical solutions of 7- to 8-year-old pupils while
   individually solving an arithmetic problem. The analysis was based on
   the ``configuration of objects,{''} an instrument derived from the
   onto-semiotic approach to mathematical knowledge. Results are
   illustrated through a number of cases. From the analysis of mathematical
   solutions, we infer the use of iconic representations as a counting tool
   for the demonstrative nature of arguments developed by pupils.},

Abstract = {The competence of modelling as part of learning about chemical change is
   analysed in a sample of 35 secondary students, ages 14 - 15 years,
   during their study of a curricular unit on this topic. The teaching
   approach followed is model based, with frequent use of analogies and
   mechanical models (fruits and bowls, Lego pieces, balls of plasticine,
   discs of coloured card, etc.) as mediators between the students'
   intuitive understanding and school science models. Qualitative and
   quantitative methods of data analysis were used, acquiring information
   through portfolios, interviews, the teacher's diary, and audiotapes. The
   qualitative results allowed a set of 12 dimensions to be defined that
   were used to characterize and evaluate different aspects of the
   competence of modelling. The assessment of the students' performance in
   each of these dimensions by means of a 4-level ordinal rubric allowed
   the data to be analysed quantitatively. The quantitative results showed
   the overall set of these dimensions to have construct validity, with 2
   sub-constructs standing out: ``Working with Models{''} and ``The Nature
   of Models{''}. The students reached satisfactory levels of competence in
   both of these sub-constructs, particularly in the latter.},

Abstract = {University students' understanding of photosynthesis was examined in a
   large introductory biosciences class. The focus of this study was to
   first examine the conceptions of photosynthesis among students in class
   and then to investigate how a certain type of text could enhance
   students' understanding of photosynthesis. The study was based on pre-
   and post-test designs, in which students' prior knowledge of
   photosynthesis was measured with ten open-ended questions. The test
   measured the students' systemic and factual levels of understanding.
   After students read either a text that systematically pointed out how
   typical misconceptions contradict scientific concepts (a refutational
   text) or a traditional text (a non-refutational text), the students'
   knowledge was tested again with the same test instrument. Results showed
   that students' prior knowledge and understanding of photosynthesis
   varied considerably, but both texts seemed to support effective
   learning. The study revealed several common systemic and factual
   misconceptions students hold concerning photosynthesis. The knowledge of
   students majoring in biology was higher than that of non-major students,
   especially concerning the systemic understanding of photosynthesis. The
   refutational text appeared to help the students who had weak prior
   knowledge. Thus, science educators should be aware of the heterogeneity
   of students concerning their levels of prior knowledge and should design
   instruction accordingly. We suggest that tools, such as refutational
   texts, can support students at the university level who have weaker
   prior understanding.},

Abstract = {Conceptual understanding is a major aim of mathematics education, and
   concept map has been used in non-mathematics research to uncover the
   relations among concepts held by students. This article presents the
   results of using concept map to assess conceptual understanding of basic
   algebraic concepts held by a group of 48 grade 8 Chinese students. The
   concept maps constructed by these students were scored by the number of
   links and propositions based on linking phrases, and these scores were
   analyzed to yield three types of results as follows: (a) relations
   associated with individual concepts, (b) relations between pairs of
   concepts, and (c) relations among all the given concepts at the whole
   class level to reveal the structure encompassing these concepts. It was
   found that the students tended to link from superordinate concepts to
   subordinate concepts. They seemed to hold different ideas about the
   relations among the concepts since there were more weak links than
   moderate and strong links in the collective map. A gap in the students'
   understanding of equations and functions was captured. The future use of
   concept map to study conceptual understanding of specific mathematics
   topics should deal with the issues of training and translation of
   findings into classroom practices.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes six seventh grade Israeli mathematics textbooks,
   examining (1) the extent to which students are required to justify and
   explain their mathematical work, and (2) whether students are asked to
   justify a mathematical claim that is stated by the textbook or a
   mathematical claim that they themselves generated when solving a
   problem. Two different units of analysis were used to analyze two
   central topics in the seventh grade curriculum as follows: (1) equation
   solving in algebra and (2) triangle properties in geometry. The findings
   indicate that all six textbooks had considerably larger percentages of
   geometric tasks than algebraic tasks, which required students to justify
   or explain their mathematical work. Moreover, considerable differences
   were found among the six textbooks regarding the percentages of tasks
   that required students to justify and explain in both topics, but more
   so with the algebraic topic. Analysis of whether the textbook tasks
   required students to justify a mathematical claim that is stated by the
   textbook or a mathematical claim that the students themselves generated
   also revealed substantial differences among the textbooks. These
   findings are discussed, as well as the research methods used, in light
   of relevant literature.},

Abstract = {The main goal of this research was to assess the effect of a dynamic
   environment on relationships between the three geneses (figural,
   instrumental, and discursive) of Spaces for Geometric Work. More
   specifically, it was to determine whether the interactive geometry
   program GeoGebra could play a specific role in the geometric work of
   future teachers. The training reveals education students' use of
   intuitive and deductive reasoning as well as their degree of cognitive
   flexibility in using different facets of geometrical work. The study
   shows that a perspective on the development of geometric reasoning must
   be integrated in the development of skills for future teachers. In
   particular, a focus on the construction of a discursive genesis linked
   with elements of figural genesis must be added to the traditional focus
   on instrumental genesis. This reasoning requires in particular a
   reflection on the role of properties in developing a form of geometry
   directed by practical (Geometry I) or more axiomatic (Geometry II)
   goals.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated elementary student teachers' scientific
   habits of mind for a series of socioscientific issues, and compared
   their views with respect to academic performance and type of programme.
   The sample consisted of 1,600 student teachers from science education,
   mathematics education, primary teacher education and social science
   education programmes (100 student teachers from each grade) at a Turkish
   University in the fall semester of the 2010-2011 school year. The data
   were obtained from the Scientific Habits of Mind Survey consisting of 32
   items which had been previously validated, in this setting. The findings
   suggested that the teacher education programmes need to help student
   teachers grasp better scientific thinking as measured via scientific
   habits of mind if they are to engage more effectively in decision-making
   and discussion of socioscientific issues in their classrooms.},

Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1143-1168},

Abstract = {In-depth interviews guided by video elicitations examined 30 high school
   science teachers' conceptions of technology and by extension how these
   conceptions reflected dimensions of nature of technology. Altogether, 64
   \% of the teachers characterized their schools and departments as
   aggressive-moderate adopters with generous access and support for
   technological tools. In comparison, 30 \% noted that their school lagged
   behind due to funding and lack of infrastructure. Definitions of
   technology revealed emphasis on technology as artifact, overwhelming
   optimism on the purpose and function of technology to improve and make
   life easier and as representation of advancement in civilization. In
   tandem, teachers were most drawn to two video scenarios-medical and
   everyday tool videos because it reflected notions of progression and
   expectations of future changes; heightened awareness of the multitude of
   available technologies; and perceived relevance with classroom content.
   Perhaps most telling in these findings was that few teachers were drawn
   to the classroom video scenario, and only three teachers highlighted the
   technology-science-school science connection. These findings have
   implications for holistic understandings of technologies, which may
   inform how science teachers perceive and enact technologies in their
   science classrooms.},

Abstract = {This study employed eye-tracking technology to examine how students with
   different levels of prior knowledge process text and data diagrams when
   reading a web-based scientific report. Students' visual behaviors were
   tracked and recorded when they read a report demonstrating the
   relationship between the greenhouse effect and global climate change in
   2 diagrams and 4 textual sections. Based on the pretest scores, 13
   participants were categorized into high and low prior knowledge (PK)
   groups. Eye-tracking measures including the total reading time, total
   fixation duration, and total regression number on each area of interest
   of the 2 groups were compared. A heat map was further used to show the
   overall visual distribution of each group. In addition, the
   inter-scanning transitions between the textual and graphical information
   of the 2 groups were compared and further confirmed by the patterns of
   the scan paths. The results revealed that overall students spent more
   time reading the textual than the graphical information. The high PK
   students showed longer fixation durations and more regressions on the
   graphics than the low PK students. Meanwhile, the high PK students
   showed more inter-scanning transitions than the low PK students not only
   between the text and graphics but also between the 2 data diagrams. This
   suggests that the high PK students were more able to integrate text and
   graphic information and inspect scientific data which is essential for
   online inquiry learning. This study provides eye-tracking evidence to
   show that low PK students have difficulties integrating scientific
   diagrams with expository texts and inspecting scientific data diagrams
   that are commonly shown in websites. Suggestions are made for future
   studies and instructional design for online inquiry-based science
   learning.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine the impact and the interplay of general
   giftedness (G) and excellence in mathematics (EM) on high school
   students' mathematical performance associated with translations from
   graphical to symbolic representations of functions, as reflected in
   cortical electrical activity (by means of ERP-event-related
   potentials-methodology). We report on findings of comparative data
   analysis based on 75 right-handed male high school students (16 -aEuro
   parts per thousand 18 years old) divided into four research groups
   designed by a combination of EM and G factors. Effects of EM factor
   appeared at the behavioral and electrophysiological levels. The fifth
   group of participants included 9 students with extraordinary
   mathematical abilities (S-MG: super mathematically gifted). We found
   that in EM participants, the G factor has no impact on the performance
   associated with translation between representations of the functions.
   The highest overall electrical activity is found in excelling in
   mathematics students who are not identified as generally gifted (NG-EM
   students). This increased electrical activity can be an indicator of
   increased cognitive load in this group of students. We identified
   accumulative and unique characteristics of S-MG at the behavioral and
   electrophysiological levels. We explain the findings by the nature of
   the tasks used in the study. We argue that a combination of the ERP
   techniques along with more traditional educational research methods
   enables obtaining reliable measures on the mental processing involved in
   learning mathematics and mathematical problem solving.},

Abstract = {The present study describes high school students' conceptions about
   acids and bases in terms of pH, pOH, microscopic level, strength, and
   concentration. A total of 27 high school students participated in the
   study. The data was collected using 3 POE tasks and a semi-structured
   interview. The data analysis demonstrated that most of the students had
   poor understanding related to a drawing of weak and strong acids. In
   addition, the findings revealed that the POE's were effective in terms
   of gathering students' predictions and reasons for the prediction of
   outcomes in an open-ended format. The POE tasks also revealed that some
   of the students had misconceptions regarding pH and pOH. The students
   believed that pH was a measurement of the acidity, while pOH was a
   measurement of the basicity. The findings obtained have certain
   implications for the secondary chemistry program.},

Abstract = {In inquiry-based science education, there have been gradual shifts in
   research interests: the nature of scientific method, the debates on the
   effects of inquiry learning, and, recently, inquiry teaching. However,
   many in-service programs for inquiry teaching have reported inconsistent
   results due to the static view of classroom inquiries and due to the
   partial perspective between individual and collaborative reflections.
   Thus, by means of a theoretical progress model of collaborative
   reflection, this qualitative research aims to investigate reflections of
   four participant teachers before and during a half-year in-service
   teacher program. The model captures the following four interactions for
   each individual teacher and among the teacher cohort: belief to
   practice, practice to belief, stimulation, and reinforcement. The
   audio-video data and their quantification allowed identification of the
   teachers' consistent prior beliefs and practices as a multiplicity of
   inquiry teaching and their interwoven progress during the program. The
   findings are further discussed in terms of the implicit development and
   the richer repertoire.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the alternative conceptions
   about burning phenomena among Atayal indigene elementary school students
   in Taiwan. The main difference from other relevant research is that this
   study assesses Atayal people's worldview by means of a questionnaire
   developed specifically for this purpose. There were three stages in this
   study: First, three Atayal elders were interviewed to access their
   traditional knowledge about nature, naturally occurring events, and
   burning. Second, this knowledge was used to develop an open-ended
   questionnaire that was administered to 37 students at the third to sixth
   grade levels (ages 9 to 12); eight respondents were interviewed to
   document their worldviews. Third, a two-tier diagnostic questionnaire
   developed from these results was administered to 228 students with 44
   respondents interviewed about the burning events assessed by the
   instrument. Results suggested that students held alternative conceptions
   about the five burning events: candles burning, factors of burning, fire
   extinguishment, material changes in burning, and traditional meanings of
   burning. In contrast with previous studies on burning, this study
   demonstrated the existence of other alternative conceptions. The origin
   of these alternative conceptions may be grounded in traditional culture,
   knowledge, environment, economy, medicine, and personal thinking.},

Abstract = {The 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment focussed on
   students' scientific competencies, measured their knowledge and provided
   questionnaires focussed on different aspects of life. One aspect was
   students' experience with information and communication technology
   (ICT). A secondary analysis of variance of the Czech Republic data
   (N=5,932 students) was conducted using the science knowledge test score
   and ICT familiarity items. The science knowledge items explored
   different thematic areas, such as evolution, mousepox, genetics and acid
   rain. The main result was that students who were connected in some way
   with ICT achieved better scores on the science knowledge test in
   comparison with students who were not. Furthermore, students whose ICT
   activity was connected with the educational process achieved a higher
   score in comparison with students whose ICT activity was not connected
   with the educational process.},

Abstract = {This paper reports an intervention study in the teaching of fraction
   concepts at a village school in Hong Kong. The classes consisted of 60
   Grade three students with different cultural backgrounds, including
   African, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Nepalese, and Pakistani. The study
   represents one of the relatively few studies that investigate the
   effectiveness of storytelling in teaching mathematics to ethnic minority
   (EM) students in the East Asian context. The quantitative analysis in a
   pre/post-test intervention/control group design shows reduction in
   achievement gap between EM students in rural settings and their Chinese
   peers in urban districts, including concepts such as part-whole
   interpretation, fraction language, and mathematics vocabulary. Analysis
   of classroom discourse based on the culturally responsive mathematics
   teaching (CRMT) framework reveals the multimodal features of
   storytelling provide greater access for EM students in acquiring
   language-related conceptualizations of fractions. Based on our analysis,
   we argue that mathematics teaching is inseparable from language
   teaching, which is often ignored or not planned explicitly in the
   lesson. Storytelling integrates language with mathematics content
   authentically and allows students to cope with the language demands in
   learning mathematics and to encounter the mathematics in real-world
   context.},

Abstract = {While scholars have proposed incorporating the study of complex
   phenomena such as chaotic systems in high school and undergraduate-level
   curricula, the literature on this topic is scant and has focused mostly
   on the analysis of mathematical models-and often only on certain
   populations, such as gifted students. We report in this manuscript an
   exploratory study involving 16 high school students engaged in a
   task-based interview. Consistent with the socio-epistemological theory
   in mathematics education, the task was informed by an analysis of the
   social practices around the historical development of the study of
   chaotic phenomena. An analysis of students' descriptions and
   justifications revealed key features of comparison as a mathematical
   type of practice involved in the study of chaotic behavior, which
   differs from common school mathematical practices. We conclude with
   implications relevant to socio-epistemological theory in mathematics
   education and suggestions to incorporate the study of chaotic phenomena
   and dynamic systems in formal education.},

Abstract = {In this study, it was aimed to experiment a new method to increase the
   quality of the history of mathematics course instruction in the primary
   mathematics education. The method composed by synthesizing project-based
   and collaborative learning methods was named ``Newspaper Preparation
   Method,{''} and the course was delivered using this method. Exploratory
   design, one of the mixed methods in which qualitative and quantitative
   techniques are both used, was applied in the study. The sample of the
   study consists of 35 undergraduate students studying in the primary
   mathematics education department. The quantitative data analyzed through
   SPSS-25 while qualitative data analyzed through content analysis. The
   results of data analysis revealed that the pre-service teachers held
   positive attitudes towards the method. Also, participants realized that
   they gained skills such as proactivity, research, inquiry,
   reproductivity, authorship, teamwork, and socializing. Besides,
   pre-service teachers' prejudices were eliminated against the course,
   their motivation increased, their curiosity was triggered, and most
   importantly the pre-service teachers deemed themselves important.
   Moreover, this method has transformed the course from a boring program
   into an exciting and enjoyable part of the syllabus. Finally,
   pre-service teachers stated that they learned the class effectively and
   permanently, their vocabulary and general knowledge increased, and their
   computer literacy improved. It is predicted that this study will
   contribute to the literature through analyzing a hands-on method and
   inspire those teaching the history of mathematics.},

Title = {Does this Answer Make Sense? Primary School Students and Adults Judge
   the Reasonableness of Computational Results in Context-Based and

Abstract = {This study investigates students' and adults' performance in judging
   reasonableness of computational results, namely reflecting on whether
   these results qualify as acceptable answers to mathematical tasks. Data
   was gathered via task-based questionnaires from 160 participants, evenly
   divided between fifth-graders and adults. Their responses to a
   systematically varied collection of context-free and context-based items
   shed light on their performance and strategies in relation to two
   interrelated aspects of reasonableness: number relationships and the
   effect of operations (internal reasonableness) and the practicality of
   answers (external reasonableness). The results revealed that students
   were better at utilising the former criterion compared to the latter,
   while for adults, the opposite was found. However, adults clearly
   outperformed students in both aspects. Task characteristics such as the
   involved numbers and operations, and the correctness or incorrectness of
   computation results, were found to be associated with fluctuations in
   performance, although the effect differed between context-free and
   context-based items. Algorithm- and rule-based strategies were more
   popular than sense-making ones especially among students, although only
   the latter type was correlated with increased correct response rates.
   Students often failed to obtain results that made sense considering
   real-life situations or the involved numbers and operations. Instead,
   they blindly trusted algorithms and rules, even when their use was
   inappropriate or insufficient. The findings highlight that to help
   students refine their ability to judge reasonableness, mathematics
   classrooms should prioritise the development of number sense and promote
   the search for connections between school mathematics and everyday life.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate teachers' learning through
   researcher-teacher partnerships (RTPs). The theoretical framework,
   developed by Bannister, was applied to examine teacher learning in RTPs.
   Specifically, a case study of an RTP was conducted, in which university
   researchers collaborated closely with mathematics teachers. The
   data-including audio recordings of lesson-preparing discussions, lesson
   plans, videotaped lessons, and post-lesson interviews-were collected and
   analyzed to describe the case. It was found that the identity of the
   participating teachers changed from ``problem posers and solution
   receivers{''} to ``collaborative problem solvers{''} in the process of
   negotiating and finding solutions to practical problems with researchers
   within the RTP. Moreover, the selected theoretical framework was
   enriched by the inclusion of enactment and reflection.},

Abstract = {Attending to the whole unit that a number refers to in a mathematical
   problem situation and showing flexibility in coordinating different
   units are foundational for mathematical understanding. In this study, we
   explored teachers' attention to and flexibility with referent units in
   situations involving fractions and fraction multiplication. Using data
   collected across the USA from 246 mathematics teachers in Grades 3-7
   where fractions are taught, we found that teachers' attention to and
   flexibility with referent units were related to each other as well as to
   teachers' overall knowledge of fractions.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the multimodal resources that attached to students'
   reasoning in the reinvention of specific geometric linear
   transformations (like reflections according to the axes, projections
   onto axes and composition of reflections) in a dynamic geometry
   environment. Following the design heuristics of Realistic Mathematics
   Education, we design a task (in Double-struck capital R-2) referring to
   specific tools and functions of GeoGebra. Task-based interviews were
   conducted with a pair of linear algebra students, by way of a computer
   and a teacher. Data was collected using a video camera observing the
   students' working environment, screen recorder software, student
   production and field notes. The data was analysed according to the
   multimodal paradigm focusing on all semiotic resources, such as gestures
   and artefact use, in addition to written signs. According to the
   findings, the artefact use, verbal and written mathematical expressions
   all interlaced with the emergence of gestures. The students mostly
   gestured when they faced a new reflection situation and when describing
   associated geometric actions. Finally, a shared environment with action,
   production and communication conveyed student reasoning and they managed
   to reinvent a number of geometric linear transformations.},

Abstract = {This article explores three attributes of teachers' understanding of
   fraction magnitude: the accuracy and reasonableness of teachers'
   estimations in response to fraction arithmetic tasks as well as the
   alignment of the estimation strategies they used with the concept of
   fraction magnitude. The data were collected from a national sample of
   mathematics teachers in grades 3-7 in which fraction concepts were
   taught (N = 603). The results indicated the teachers' estimations were
   only partially accurate and reasonable, particularly when fraction
   division was involved. Furthermore, teachers' credentials and the grade
   level at which they taught mathematics were significantly related to
   teachers' understanding of fraction magnitude.},

Abstract = {Toulmin's argumentation model is an effective tool in the description of
   one step of an argument. However, there is a need to consider more than
   this model to portray a comprehensive argumentation process. The purpose
   of the study is to investigate types of global argumentation structures
   that emerged while prospective middle school mathematics teachers were
   working on conjecture-generation activities related to geometry. The
   participants were junior prospective middle school mathematics teachers
   at a state university in Ankara, Turkey. The eight global argumentation
   structures that emerged via conjecture-generation activities of two
   groups were classified as mono structures and hybrid structures.
   According to the findings, three types of mono structures, which are the
   reservoir-structure, the funneling-structure, and the
   branching-structure, were seen among four possible cases. Three types of
   hybrid structures were observed among eleven possible combinations of
   the mono structures, namely, the reservoir-funneling-structure, the
   line-branching-structure, and the line-reservoir-branching-structure.},

Abstract = {This manuscript reports a collaborative self-study conducted by three
   teacher educators who carried out and discussed joint observations of
   mathematics instruction in preservice teachers' field experience
   classrooms. We investigated the teacher educator identities that
   influenced our perspectives on and interpretations of preservice
   teachers' mathematics instruction. A duoethnographic approach supported
   us in interrogating ourselves alongside one another and presenting our
   resulting analysis as a polyvocal dialogue. Transcripts illustrate key
   identities that shaped our classroom observations (methods course
   instructor, supervisor, teacher, and researcher) and evolving aspects of
   those identities (becoming an insider as a supervisor, an
   outsider-within as a researcher). The transformative stories reported
   here contribute needed insights into how mathematics teacher educators'
   identities relate to their practices as supervisors of preservice
   teachers, an area that has received scant attention in the mathematics
   teacher education literature.},

Abstract = {National and international large-scale assessments of mathematics show
   that, in most nations, males achieve better results than females and
   Italy is one of the countries with a greater gap. Many research studies
   in mathematics education have analysed this issue, using both
   quantitative and qualitative methods to understand the sources and
   characteristics of this gap. This study focuses on a specific Grade 10
   task that requires algebraic manipulations of powers with the same base.
   Item-level analysis enables the study of gender differences on specific
   content, before using the lenses of mathematics education theories to
   interpret macro-phenomena emergeing from standardized assessment
   results. The quantitative analysis, carried out using the Rasch
   statistical model, highlights a gender gap in favour of males in this
   task and, furthermore, a variance in choices of incorrect options
   between males and females; the interviews conducted provide a key to
   understanding this phenomenon in terms of didactic contract.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies on paper and pencil- and computer-based tests
   principally focus on statistical analysis of students' performances. In
   educational assessment, comparing students' performance (in terms of
   right or wrong results) does not imply a comparison of problem-solving
   processes followed by students. In this paper, we present a theoretical
   tool for task analysis that allows us to highlight how students'
   problem-solving processes could change in switching from paper to
   computer format and how these changes could be affected by the use of
   one environment rather than another. In particular, the aim of our study
   lies in identifying a set of indexes to highlight possible consequences
   that specific changes in task formulation have, in terms of task
   comparability. Therefore, we propose an example of the use of the tool
   for comparing paper-based and computer-based tasks.},

Abstract = {This study serves two purposes. The first purpose is the development and
   validation of a Mathematics Teachers' Beliefs Scale (MTBS). In addition
   to providing a valid and reliable MTBS instrument, this study provides
   information on the process of developing and validating the instrument,
   which shall be useful for the development and validation of similar
   instruments. The second purpose of this study is to explore the
   relationship between teachers' beliefs and their teaching experience.
   Using a validated MTBS, this study assessed the beliefs of four groups
   of Chinese high school mathematics teachers with varying years of
   professional teaching experience: 1-5 years (n = 25), 6-10 years (n =
   70), 11-20 years (n = 48), and 21+ years (n = 28). The MTBS is composed
   of 26 items distributed across five subscales spanning beliefs about
   mathematics, learning, teaching, students, and teachers. Among the four
   groups, the results of this study indicate that there were no
   significant differences in scores on beliefs about mathematics,
   mathematics learning, mathematics teaching, students, and teachers.
   Further item analysis revealed that longer teaching experience does not
   necessarily mean that a teacher holds reform-oriented views. However,
   teachers with 6-10 years of experience were most likely to hold a more
   dialectic view of mathematics.},

Abstract = {Significant research in science and mathematics education should advance
   the field's knowledge and understanding of the teaching and learning of
   science and mathematics. How, then, should the significance of a
   research question in science and mathematics education be assessed? And,
   when disseminating the findings of research, how should the significance
   of the research questions be communicated? In this study, we analyzed
   peer reviews to answer these questions. Our analysis revealed the main
   issues peer reviewers identify about research questions and the ways
   they are communicated during the dissemination of research. The findings
   provide insights for new and experienced researchers about communicating
   the significance of research questions, and they also illustrate how
   reviewer comments in peer-reviewed journals can provide a window into
   the field's frontiers.},

Abstract = {This study explored the teaching and learning beliefs of qualified
   (in-field) secondary science teachers who were teaching mathematics
   out-of-field that is, without qualification. The relationship between
   secondary teachers' beliefs about their in-field subject-science and
   their out-of-field subject-mathematics was examined. The theory of
   boundary crossing and frameworks of beliefs about science and
   mathematics teaching and learning were used to explore continuities of
   beliefs when crossing disciplinary boundaries to teach mathematics
   out-of-field. Individual semi-structured interviews and video-stimulated
   interviews were used to collect data about teachers' beliefs and
   teaching practice for science and mathematics. Continuity of beliefs
   across science and mathematics was more likely when teachers held
   traditional beliefs about science. Continuity of non-traditional beliefs
   about learning and teaching science and mathematics was less likely,
   though some teachers did show evidence of beginning to adopt, or exhibit
   a desire to learn more about, constructivist approaches to teaching
   mathematics.},

Title = {Integrating STEM with <i>AgLIT</i> (Agricultural Literacy Through
   Innovative Technology): The Efficacy of a Project-Based Curriculum for

Abstract = {Agriculture can serve as a unifying and contextualizing topic that
   connects science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   subjects through similar knowledge, skills, and attitudes/beliefs
   (KSABs) exhibited in each. Agriculture can be an integral part of
   students' primary-level curriculum, providing authentic and relevant
   material for STEM exploration. A technology-enhanced, project-based,
   STEM-integrated agriculture curriculum for fourth-grade learners was
   developed and implemented in a large urban school district in the
   northeastern U.S. Ninety-five students and four fourth-grade teachers
   participated in a study that sought to (1) add to the existing knowledge
   about the nature of upper-primary urban students' agricultural literacy,
   (2) create a fully STEM-integrated agricultural literacy curriculum that
   educators can easily embed in existing curricula to increase literacy in
   agriculture and STEM fields, and (3) test the efficacy of that
   curriculum. The curriculum included valid and reliable pre- and posttest
   knowledge and attitudes instruments and eight performance tasks designed
   to help students prepare for a farmers' market. The findings revealed
   that students in the treatment group gained knowledge and had more
   positive attitudes/beliefs following the curriculum's implementation
   compared to a control group. Implications for creating integrated STEM
   and agriculture curricula using technology-enhanced, project-based
   learning strategies are discussed.},

Abstract = {Recently, pedagogical approaches have focused on creating
   arts-integrated STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
   or STEAM classes, which have drawn attention to the importance of the
   arts in science education. Despite increasing development and
   implementation of STEAM initiatives in science, there is limited
   discussion on the theoretical foundations, which could provide sound
   guidelines for science educators and teachers in planning and teaching
   STEAM curricula. In this paper, we set out the theoretical framework
   that explains and justifies integration of the arts and socio-cultural
   interaction into science teaching and learning. We explain in some
   detail the component theoretical elements and describe how these
   elements translate into teaching/learning practices in STEAM lessons. We
   conclude by re-emphasising the application of theoretical frameworks for
   the design of teaching/learning practices in an intercultural STEAM
   program.},

Abstract = {Arrows are recognized as efficient visual elements in conveying
   location, direction, connection, and process because the shape is
   thought to have an immediate, common sense impact on viewers. However,
   the results of our prior quantitative study did not support the assumed
   effects of arrows in reading energy pyramid diagrams. The current study
   utilized an integrated cognitive semiotics framework and a 5-phase
   interview to compare the interpretations of energy pyramid diagrams with
   or without arrows in controlled contexts. Grade 7 students (N = 18) with
   3 levels of prior knowledge were randomly assigned to an experimental
   group (with arrows) or a control group (without arrows). Results
   suggested that arrows elicited more functional interpretations and
   confirmed that arrows could invite thematic meanings more efficiently.
   However, the finding that low prior knowledge participants had
   difficulty interpreting thematic meanings and generated
   misinterpretations suggests that prior knowledge plays a role in making
   meaning from diagrams. Considerations of the research methods and
   suggestions for pedagogy are discussed.},

Abstract = {Context-based learning (CBL) approaches have been recommended and
   expanded in science education to make science more relevant to students
   by connecting science content with students' daily life. Subsequently,
   in order to implement CBL at school, a group of scenarios has been
   produced by several stakeholders. However, there is a lack of resources
   to measure effectively what makes a good scenario. Thus, this study aims
   to develop and validate a scenario evaluation instrument to examine
   students' perspectives on science career-related scenarios through the
   lens of relevance and interest. For this purpose, 25 science
   career-related scenarios and a measurement tool, Scenario Evaluation
   with Relevance and Interest (SERI), were developed by a team of
   researchers for the EU funded MultiCO project. Then, lower secondary
   school students from three different countries, Estonia, Finland, and
   the UK, were asked to respond to the newly developed instrument after
   reading the scenarios, and their responses were analyzed by factor
   analyses and multivariate analysis of variance. According to the result,
   this instrument has good construct validity and reliability. However, it
   indicates one issue of discriminant validity between two factors,
   individual dimension and societal dimension. Also, significant gender
   differences were found in the Estonian sample regarding students'
   perspectives on the scenarios. Possible interpretations of the results
   and implications of the suggested measurement tool are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a theoretical framework for conceptualizing
   socioscientific decision making, reviews current research in this area,
   and intends to shed some light on the instructional design for the
   classroom implementation of socioscientific decision making. The
   framework involves 3 phases: formulate the decision-making space, posit
   a decision-making strategy, and reflect on the decision-making process.
   A total of 24 articles that specifically focused on socioscientific
   decision making were included. They were classified into 2 groups. The
   first group explored students' socioscientific decision-making behavior
   and its relationships with their cognitive conditions. The second
   examined the effectiveness of the interventions, that is, task
   conditions. The analysis showed that most of the studies in both groups
   focused on phase 1 and studied 3 research themes: informal reasoning,
   evidence-based reasoning, and social interactions. The findings
   indicated the challenges phases 1 and 2 posed to students, such as
   prioritizing criteria and employing a suitable decision-making strategy.
   Two cognitive conditions, scientific knowledge and scientific
   epistemological beliefs, appeared to have a more direct impact on
   evidence-based reasoning rather than on informal reasoning. Group 2
   studies designed various interventions and looked into divergent
   socioscientific decision-making performances across 3 phases. The
   framework helps conceptualize socioscientific decision making in a more
   structural and holistic way. The content review provides instructional
   insights for the socioscientific decision-making process and suggests
   several future research directions.},

Abstract = {The present work shows how 4-6-year-old Spanish children interpret
   numbers and space intervals in the ruler when measuring length. To
   determine it, 4 ad hoc rulers are designed and used with a sample of 103
   children from two schools of Toledo province (Spain). The sample is
   characterized respecting conservation and measurement with the standard
   ruler confirming that these children mostly neither conserve nor use the
   standard ruler correctly, regardless their time exposure to instruction.
   With the use of our rulers, we confirm that numbers hinder in measuring
   length, and discrete units imbedded in the ruler help children to
   measure correctly. A good scaffold is found to help children
   conceptualize space intervals as iterating objects consisting on the use
   of rulers with discrete units on them. Its use is recommended preceding
   the one of standard rulers.},

Abstract = {This article reports the findings of classroom research exploring the
   potential of posing challenging mathematical problems situated in
   real-world financial contexts to activate mathematical knowledge, skills
   and reasoning. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
   (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012
   mathematical literacy assessment framework (OECD, 2013) provided
   theoretical framing for the study, which examined the use of a financial
   dilemma titled Shopping for shoes in a Year 5/6 composite class in a
   suburban Australian primary school. The social and mathematical
   dimensions of the task, together with a particular lesson structure,
   successfully engaged 10 to 12-year-old students in exploring mathematics
   through a financial problem-solving experience. The findings reveal that
   students' notions of friendship and fairness guided the way they
   formulated the problem and employed mathematics. Strategies intended to
   encourage students to interpret the alignment and reasonableness of
   their social and mathematical thinking against the problem context were
   critical to the lesson.},

Title = {Development and Application of Learning Materials to Help Students
   Understand Ten Statements Describing the Nature of Scientific
   Observation},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Observing scientific events or objects is a complex process that occurs
   through the interaction between the observer's knowledge or
   expectations, the surrounding context, physiological features of the
   human senses, scientific inquiry processes, and the use of observational
   instruments. Scientific observation has various features specific to
   this process. In this study, we describe the nature of scientific
   observation in 10 statements that have been emphasized by educators,
   philosophers, and psychologists and discuss their educational
   implications. To help students understand these 10 statements, learning
   materials were developed and tested with 110 10th-grade students. The
   results for almost all statements showed that students' agreement on the
   nature of scientific observation increased after studying the materials,
   and the agreement was found to be stable because it had not decreased 6
   weeks later. We conclude on this basis that the difficult philosophical
   and psychological concepts involved in scientific observation can be
   taught effectively to high school students if we develop and use
   activities appropriate to their level that can further their
   understanding.},

Abstract = {Declining enrolments in science, technology, engineering and mathematics
   (STEM) disciplines and a lack of interest in STEM careers are concerning
   at a time when society is becoming more reliant on complex technologies.
   We examine student aspirations for STEM careers by drawing on surveys
   conducted annually from 2012 to 2015. School students in years 3 to 12
   (n = 6492) were asked to indicate their occupational choices. A logistic
   regression analysis showed that being in the older cohorts, possessing
   high cultural capital, being male, having a parent in a STEM occupation
   and high prior achievement in reading and numeracy, were significant.
   This analysis provides a strong empirical basis for school-based
   initiatives to improve STEM participation. In particular, strategies
   should target the following: the persistent lack of interest by females
   in some careers, improving student academic achievement in both literacy
   and numeracy and expanding knowledge of STEM careers, especially for
   students without familial STEM connections.},

Title = {Patterns of Motivational Beliefs in the Science Learning of Total,
   High-, and Low-Achieving Students: Evidence of Taiwanese TIMSS 2011 Data},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the pattern of the
   relationships among motivational beliefs and science achievement of 8th
   grade Taiwanese students, given that the students in Taiwan have high
   science academic achievement but low motivational beliefs in science
   learning on a series of international large-scale assessments. Three
   motivational beliefs in science learning, including self-concept,
   intrinsic value, and utility value, were conceptualized based on the
   modern expectancy-value theory. Data are from the Taiwanese proportion
   of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2011
   dataset. Three groups of students, namely, the total group, the
   high-achieving group (HAG), and the low-achieving group (LAG), were
   examined. Results showed that the patterns of the relative predictions
   of motivational beliefs to science achievement were distinct for each
   group. In the total group, all the motivational beliefs could positively
   predict science achievement (R (2) = 20\%). On the other hand,
   self-concept could positively and negatively predict science achievement
   for the HAG and LAG students, respectively, and intrinsic value could
   positively predict science achievement for the LAG students. In
   conclusion, this study, based on the Taiwanese representative sample,
   contributes to the discussion regarding national variation in students'
   motivational beliefs and provides empirical-based evidence of the
   motivational beliefs in science learning of students of different levels
   of ability.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the cognitive obstacles related to one aspect of
   mathematization in physics problem-solving, namely, what might be called
   structuring for mathematization, where the problem situation is
   structured in such a way that a translation to a mathematical universe
   can be done. We report the results of an analysis of four protocols from
   task-based interviews with university students working on physics
   problems in pairs who fail when solving the problems. The obstacles
   encountered by the students are shown to be related to how the students
   approach the structuring for mathematization, but they are met at
   different steps in this process. Four types of obstacles are identified.},

Abstract = {Navigating the current STEM agendas and debates is complex and
   challenging. Perspectives on the nature of STEM education and how it
   should be implemented without losing discipline integrity, approaches to
   incorporating the arts (STEAM) and how equity in access to STEM
   education can be increased are just a few of the many issues faced by
   researchers and educators. There are no straightforward answers.
   Opinions on how STEM education should be advanced vary across school
   contexts, curricula and political arenas. This position paper addresses
   five core issues: (a) perspectives on STEM education, (b) approaches to
   STEM integration, (c) STEM discipline representation, (d) equity in
   access to STEM education and (e) extending STEM to STEAM. A number of
   pedagogical affordances inherent in integrated STEM activities are
   examined, with the integration of modelling and engineering design
   presented as an example of how such learning affordances can be
   capitalized on.},

Abstract = {This mixed methods study examined an association between cognitive types
   of teachers' mathematical content knowledge and students' performance in
   lower secondary schools (grades 5 through 9). Teachers (N = 90)
   completed the Teacher Content Knowledge Survey (TCKS), which consisted
   of items measuring different cognitive types of teacher knowledge. The
   first cognitive type (T1) assessed participants' knowledge of basic
   facts and procedures. The second cognitive type (T2) measured teachers'
   understanding of concepts and connections. The third cognitive type (T3)
   gauged teachers' knowledge of mathematical models and generalizations.
   The study comprised two levels of quantitative data analysis. First, we
   explored each cognitive type of teachers' content knowledge and the
   overall TCKS score as they related to student performance. Second, we
   studied the correlation between each cognitive type of teacher content
   knowledge to deepen the understanding of content associations. Results
   of the study show a statistically significant correlation between
   cognitive types T1 and T2 of teacher content knowledge and student
   performance (p < .05). The correlation between cognitive type T3 and
   student performance was not significant (p = .0678). The most
   substantial finding was the correlation between teachers' total score on
   the TCKS and student performance (Pearson's r = .2903, p = .0055 < .01).
   These results suggest that teachers' content knowledge plays an
   important role in student performance at the lower secondary school. The
   qualitative phase included structured interviews with two of the teacher
   participants in order to further elaborate on the nature of the
   quantitative results of the study.},

Abstract = {With regard to the moderate performance of German students in
   international large-scale assessments, one branch of German science
   education research is concerned with the construction and evaluation of
   competence models. Based on the theory-driven definition of competence
   levels, these models imply a correlation between the complexity of a
   question or a problem, its difficulty and the cognitive demands that are
   required to answer or solve it. The aim of the study was to apply two
   competence models in order to analyse the complexity of questions that
   chemistry teachers use to promote learning in class as well as to
   compare the results of this analysis. Two model-based coding schemes
   were constructed and evaluated on the basis of interrater reliability
   before analysing the teacher questions in 40 chemistry lessons. The
   results show that between 60 and 65 \% of the questions refer to low
   complexity levels. Although there is a considerable correspondence
   between the results (69.2 \%), neither model can be considered as
   redundant. These findings are discussed with regard to the level and the
   development of students' skills in science.},

Abstract = {This article describes sixth-grade students' engagement in two
   model-eliciting activities offering students the opportunity to
   construct mathematical models. The findings show that students utilized
   their knowledge of fractions including conceptual and procedural
   knowledge in constructing mathematical models for the given situations.
   Some students were also able to generalize the fraction model and
   transfer it to a new situation. Analysis of the students' work
   demonstrates that they made use of four fraction constructs-part-whole,
   operator, quotients, and ratio. The activities also revealed
   difficulties in the students' knowledge of fractions, some of which were
   overcome in the process of organizing and mathematizing the problem.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to portray students' misconceptions
   and errors while solving conceptually and procedurally oriented tasks
   involving length, area, and volume measurement. The data were collected
   from 445 sixth grade students attending public primary schools in
   Ankara, Turkiye via a test composed of 16 constructed-response format
   tasks. The findings revealed a wide range of misconceptions and errors
   such as ``believing that all rulers are 30 cm long,{''} ``confusing area
   formula with perimeter formula,{''} ``believing a box has more than one
   surface area,{''} ``using the volume formula for surface area,{''}
   ``believing that ruler must be longer than the object measured,{''} etc.
   These misconceptions and errors could be considered as the evidences
   indicating the sixth graders' lack of comprehension of the fundamental
   concepts of spatial measurement and their relationships and the
   procedures and formulas used for measuring length, area, and volume. The
   possible causes of such misconceptions and overcoming ways were also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Many studies in the field of chemical education have emphasized the fact
   that students at secondary level have considerable difficulties in
   mastering organic chemistry contents. As a result, they choose to learn
   these contents in a ``rote{''} way. Taking this fact into consideration,
   the first aim of our study was to help students in overcoming the
   aforementioned difficulties by applying new instructional tools-systemic
   synthesis questions {[}SSynQs]. To achieve the aim of our research, an
   experiment with two parallel groups was conducted. The experimental
   group was taught using {[}SSynQs] and the control group was taught using
   a traditional approach. The study included 65 students, 41 males, and 24
   females, aged between 17-18 years. All the students attended the same
   high school and were taught by the instructions of the same teacher. The
   results showed that students from the experimental group achieved higher
   scores on the final testing than students from the control group. This
   confirmed the fact that application of {[}SSynQs] in the educational
   process improves students' meaningful learning in organic chemistry
   domain. Additionally, after conducting an exploratory factor analysis of
   the obtained data, {[}SSynQs] were characterized as highly effective
   tools for assessing students' meaningful understanding. Furthermore, our
   study has highlighted and connected two applications of {[}SSynQs] in
   the chemistry educational process. Firstly as an instructional tool and
   secondly as an assessment tool. The important task for future research
   would be to evaluate a third application of {[}SSynQs] as a diagnostic
   tool.},

Title = {MENTAL MODELS ABOUT SEISMIC EFFECTS: STUDENTS' PROFILE BASED COMPARATIVE

Abstract = {Nowadays, meaningful learning takes a central role in science education
   and is based in mental models that allow the representation of the real
   world by individuals. Thus, it is essential to analyse the student's
   mental models by promoting an easier reconstruction of scientific
   knowledge, by allowing them to become consistent with the curricular
   models presented in the classroom. In this context, the study aims to
   examine, through the application of a diagnostic instrument (Two-Tier
   Diagnostic Test), what students consider to be the seismic effects on
   soils and buildings, to analyse and to compare their mental models about
   some of these issues related to seismology, applying a questionnaire to
   52 students from a Portuguese University attending an undergraduate
   degree in Geology and a master course in Biology and Geology teaching.
   The analysis of the data allowed concluding that undergraduate students
   have more inconsistent mental models than master students, mainly
   concerning the factors which influence the seismic risk, such as hazard
   and vulnerability, and the soils characteristics which influence the
   intensity of earthquakes. During their academic formation in the
   university, teachers present some curricular models to students which
   allow them to reconstruct their mental models and turn them
   scientifically consistent, enhancing the educational implications of
   this study that points to the need for teachers to be aware of the
   importance of the diagnosis of the students' mental models and to
   promote meaningful learning and scientific literacy autonomously and
   dynamically.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the development of an online dynamic approach
   for assessing and improving students' reading comprehension of science
   texts-the dynamic assessment for reading comprehension of science text
   (DARCST). The DARCST blended assessment and response-specific
   instruction into a holistic learning task for grades 5 and 6 students.
   The DARCST, a layer-cake approach (interspersed responses and feedback)
   to assessment as learning, takes a graduated-prompts perspective on the
   criteria for reading comprehension of science text. The item response
   theory (IRT) analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) over an
   instructional period indicated that the DARCST was applicable for most
   students with a wide range of reading abilities. Based on the acceptable
   psychometrics, the DARCST appears to be appropriate for use in
   middle-years science programs where enhanced science reading is a goal.},

Abstract = {This study explored the influence of experimental goal setting and
   planning on the attitudes toward science, self-efficacy, inquiry
   performance, and achievement of students with low academic performance.
   A total of 71 students aged 16-18 were randomly divided into a treatment
   group (with goal setting and planning) and a control group (without goal
   setting and planning). A microcomputer-based laboratory focused on
   Boyle's Law, coupled with an inquiry worksheet, was assigned. Based on
   Winne and Hadwin's model of self-regulated learning, scaffolding was
   offered to the treatment group to promote goal setting and planning.
   Data were collected from the worksheet, the Attitudes toward Science
   Scale, the Self-efficacy of Scientific Inquiry scale, and the Boyle's
   Law Conceptual Test. The results showed that both the treatment and
   control groups improved significantly from the pre- to post-conceptual
   tests. In the treatment group, the male students gained significantly
   more conceptual knowledge than the female students. Regarding attitudes
   toward science, the male students' scores on the post-test were higher
   than those of the females. It is concluded that the male students were
   more positive regarding goal setting and planning in the inquiry
   activity, whereas the female students did not benefit as much.},

Abstract = {Common core standards, interdisciplinary education, and
   discipline-specific literacy are common international education reforms.
   The constructive-interpretative language arts pairs (speaking-listening,
   writing-reading, representing-viewing) and the communication,
   construction, and persuasion functions of language are central in these
   movements. This research developed and validated a communication
   progression in science education for elementary-secondary schooling in
   Taiwan. The framework for the communication progression was based on
   relevant literature, international curricula, and focus-group
   deliberations; it consisted of three dimensions: presentation, reaction,
   and negotiation. Delphi deliberations with questionnaires were applied
   to experts to evaluate the theoretical considerations and to experienced
   science teachers to evaluate the practical considerations. Results
   confirmed the importance of communications in science learning and the
   developmental nature of communications across elementary, middle, and
   secondary schools and validated the proposed framework and progression.
   The communication progression has application to other international
   education systems as they address common core standards and curricula in
   language and science.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This study aims to better understand questions related to the impact of
   teacher quality and access to qualified teachers in China. A large-scale
   data set collected in 2010 in China was used along with concurrently
   collected teacher questionnaires. In total, surveys from 9,943 8th grade
   students from 343 middle schools in 6 provinces were used, along with
   2,084 teacher questionnaires from each of the sampled schools.
   Multilevel (or hierarchical linear) statistical modeling analyses along
   with multivariate analysis of variance were completed to investigate the
   impact of science teacher characteristics on student achievement and
   whether there was an ``opportunity gap{''} between high and low
   socioeconomic status (SES) students' access to qualified science
   teachers in the subject of biology, physics, and earth and space
   science. In this research, little evidence was found to support the
   claim that teacher-related factors are consistently related to student
   achievement in science, while school-level SES was considered in the
   model. However, school-level SES was consistently found to be an
   influential factor of student science achievement. In addition, it was
   discovered that, in China, a disparity was found between high and low
   SES schools with respect to access to quality teachers.},

Abstract = {In order to teach mathematics effectively, mathematics teachers need to
   have a sound mathematical knowledge, but what constitutes sound
   mathematical knowledge for teaching is subject to debate. This paper is
   an attempt to unpack what constitutes teacher knowledge of the concept
   of a function which is a unifying idea in the mathematics curriculum.
   The central components of the framework, which will be elaborated on in
   this paper, are: teachers' subject matter knowledge, teachers'
   pedagogical content knowledge, teachers' technological pedagogical

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the science activities offered at 7th grade in
   the Turkish science and technology curriculum along with addressing the
   curriculum's original intent. We refer to several science education
   researchers' ideas, including Chinn \& Malhotra's (Science Education,
   86:175-218, 2002) theoretical framework and Edelson's (1998)
   conceptualization of authentic science practices in our analyses. Our
   primary goal is to critique the science and technology curriculum and
   then offer alternative insights into learning science and doing science
   about force and motion concepts at 7th grade from epistemological and
   sociological perspectives. We introduce an Immersion Unit for teaching
   and learning the concepts of force and motion and discuss the elements
   of this immersion approach. Finally, we provide recommendations for
   designing and implementing similar immersion units for the science
   activities that are in practice.},

Abstract = {Innovative educational approaches in the sciences have emphasized
   inquiry in the classroom but it is not self-evident that inquiry
   instruction leads to conceptual understanding. A design research cycle
   was conducted to investigate how physics instruction aimed at creating a
   classroom culture of inquiry can contribute to Grade 9 students'
   understanding of theoretical concepts in direct current electric
   circuits. A hypothesized local instruction theory and classroom pedagogy
   were created in cooperation with 3 physics teachers, emphasizing (a)
   establishing classroom norms of inquiry, (b) providing a theoretical
   starting point, (c) using targeted experiments guided by conceptual
   questions, and (d) theory-oriented, whole-class discussions. After data
   collection, retrospective analysis of 1 class showed that the enactment
   of the local instruction theory and the development of classroom norms
   of inquiry had led to the expected learning processes and increased
   student conceptual understanding. Science education promoting the nature
   of science as inquiry might consider the importance of an effective
   local instruction theory and the social classroom processes that require
   science-oriented classroom norms.},

Abstract = {In this paper we explore some of factors that affect bilingual students'
   comprehension of story problems: vocabulary, syntax, cultural relevance
   and understanding of the word problem genre. In an effort to determine
   how these factors interact, we asked 18 Spanish/English bilingual
   children to retell and solve arithmetic story problems in their first
   and second language in one-on-one interviews. We found that students
   attempted to build meaningful representations with coherence among
   events and actions and manipulated the quantities according to their
   interpretation. Occasional unfamiliar vocabulary tended not to be an
   issue. Children made inferences drawing on their personal experiences to
   make the texts more coherent. It was not so much the surface features of
   the text including syntax and vocabulary that interfered with children's
   interpreting them successfully, rather it was the situations and the
   limited information provided about them that affected comprehension. We
   conclude with implications for teachers and textbook writers.},

Abstract = {Knowledge is not simply a collection of facts, principles, and formulas;
   instead, meaningful knowledge is organized around core concepts that
   guide peoples' thinking about a subject. Therefore, knowledge
   organization is recognized as an important component of understanding
   learning and teaching. In this research, knowledge organization of two
   physics university textbooks was compared with that of four physics
   university teachers. The topic studied was magnetostatics with an
   emphasis on two topics of Biot-Savart law and AmpSre's law. The aim of
   study was to examine the structural features of the subject matter
   knowledge of teachers and textbooks. For this reason, concept maps were
   utilized to picture clearly their knowledge organizations. Concept maps
   were evaluated by means of a focus on their structural characteristics
   including hierarchy and clustering. Results indicate that the
   hierarchical organizations between knowledge of teachers and textbooks
   vary from one topic to another. The hierarchical organizations of
   teachers are more comparable to textbooks for the topic of Biot-Savart
   law. The clustering behaves in a very similar way in the case of
   patterns between textbooks and teachers for both topics. It was observed
   that the knowledge arrangements of AmpSre's law were more hierarchical,
   while the knowledge organizations of Biot-Savart were more clustered.
   Moreover, structural properties varied from one topic to another, even
   though topics belong to the same context. The possibility of recognizing
   such difference in knowledge organization is a first step towards
   developing more effective teaching and learning solutions.},

Title = {A SURVEY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL, MOTIVATIONAL, FAMILY AND PERCEPTIONS OF

Abstract = {This paper investigates the factors that influence 15-year-old students'
   intentions to study physics post-16, when it is no longer compulsory.
   The analysis is based on the year 10 (age, 15 years) responses of 5,034
   students from 137 England schools as learners of physics during the
   academic year 2008-2009. Factor analyses uncovered a range of
   physics-specific constructs, 7 of which were statistically significantly
   associated with intention to study physics post-16 in our final
   multi-level model; in descending order of effect size, these are
   extrinsic material gain motivation, intrinsic value of physics, home
   support for achievement in physics, emotional response to physics
   lessons, perceptions of physics lessons, physics self-concept and
   advice-pressure to study physics. A further analysis using individual
   items from the survey rather than constructs (aggregates of items)
   supported the finding that extrinsic motivation in physics was the most
   important factor associated with intended participation. In addition,
   this item-level analysis indicated that, within the advice-pressure to
   study physics construct, the encouragement individual students receive
   from their teachers is the key factor that encourages them to intend to
   continue with physics post-16.},

Abstract = {This study presents the systematic development, validation, and use of a
   new instrument for measuring student interest in science and technology.
   The Student Interest in Technology and Science (SITS) survey is composed
   of 5 sub-sections assessing the following dimensions: interest in
   learning science, using technology to learn science, science careers,
   technology careers, and attitudes toward biotechnology. Our development
   process included review of existing instrumentation, pilot testing, and
   expert panel review. The resulting instrument was administered before
   and after implementation of a biotechnology intervention which used a
   computer-based game to engage learners in the use of biotechnology to
   address a societal issue. We employed item response theory (IRT) to
   explore instrument validity and precision. Results of the psychometric
   analyses suggest that the SITS survey has a well-defined structure and
   meets IRT assumptions. Difficulty and discrimination parameters as well
   as reliability analyses indicate that SITS items provide useful measures
   of student interest. Finally, we use the SITS to explore the extent to
   which the intervention used in this study supports changes in student
   interest and association between students' interest and related content
   knowledge. Implications for the future use of this instrument are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This article presents an exploratory case study of a teacher's
   knowledge, understanding, and practice of critical pedagogy in a
   sheltered instruction high school biology classroom. This case study
   relied on the use of fieldnotes, videotape recordings, interviews, and
   transcripts to showcase the practices and activities taking place in the
   classroom. The evidence gathered throughout this case study demonstrates
   that Ms. Rodriguez has been able to establish a classroom environment
   and develop curricula that reflect the major critical pedagogy themes:
   (a) identity/personal growth, (b) academic/cognitive development, and
   (c) critical understanding of society, power, inequality, and students'
   own personal power to change their statuses or roles. These themes were
   identified in different events during the teaching of her genetic unit,
   ethnobotany unit, and personal issues activity. As a science educator
   and SI teacher, Ms. Rodriguez has realized that for her students to be
   able to succeed academically and in life, she needs to center her
   instruction and curricula on her students' personal lives, academic
   needs, and an awareness of their surrounding community.},

Title = {ENGAGING FIFTH GRADERS IN SCIENTIFIC MODELING TO LEARN ABOUT EVAPORATION

Abstract = {Reform efforts in science education have aimed at fostering scientific
   literacy by helping learners meaningfully engage in scientific practices
   to make sense of the world. In this paper, we report on our second year
   of unit implementation that has investigated 34 fifth grade students'
   (10-year-olds) learning about evaporation and condensation through
   scientific modeling in the USA. We discuss how students who engaged in
   modeling constructed explanations of evaporation and condensation,
   considered empirical evidence when constructing their models, and used
   models to predict other phenomena. We constructed a coding scheme based
   on an iterative process and qualitatively analyzed assessment items,
   interview questions, and classroom videos in order to find out what
   students learned through modeling. The results of our empirical work
   indicate that students made significant progress in constructing models
   that convey unobservable characteristics of molecular mechanisms or
   processes. They also made progress in using models as tools consistent
   with evidence and using models to predict other phenomena, but the
   progress was to a less sophisticated level. We theorize that some
   aspects of modeling practice are more aligned with typical school norms
   and practices than others-enabling some aspects to be more readily
   appropriated than others. We conclude the manuscript with ways to
   capitalize on the successes of this practice and to address challenges
   that could be taken to help improve students' understanding of science
   through engagement in scientific modeling.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the impact of teaming school-based
   instructional coaches with science or mathematics middle school teachers
   to build a community of practice around inquiry instruction. This
   professional development model began with a 2-week summer institute and
   continued with four follow-up sessions during the academic school year
   for the teacher and instructional coach participants. The teachers'
   participation in this professional development program with (1) content
   instruction through inquiry lessons, (2) practice teaching to middle
   school students, and (3) coach-led reflection improved their
   understanding of inquiry-based practices and the quality of their
   classroom inquiry implementation. Professional development experiences
   that prepare teachers and coaches simultaneously in inquiry and content
   may help build a shared language for reform and accelerate inquiry
   instructional changes.},

Abstract = {Our study was enacted in university mathematics education classes in the
   USA with preservice teachers (PSTs). This research focused on PSTs'
   interview responses that were used to assess their understanding of
   balance when challenged with tasks involving virtual manipulatives.
   Siegler's rules were used in analyzing PSTs' responses to balance tasks
   to help determine each PST's level of abstraction achieved regarding
   balance, equilibrium, or equivalence. Specifically, the data were
   analyzed regarding 3 different aspects: (a) the PSTs' understanding of
   balance, (b) what previous knowledge was exhibited by the PSTs
   throughout the enactment of the tasks, and (c) the mathematics utilized
   by the PSTs as they problem-solved with the virtual balance applet. The
   results showed PSTs relying on visual cues to implement procedures that
   were often inappropriate for the task at hand. When confronted with
   missing value balance tasks, 47 \% of the PSTs attempted an incorrect
   procedure using direct proportions, and some (35 \%) employed an
   incorrect fractional method. One PST systematically solved tasks, where
   he invented an inverse proportions model. However, most interviewees
   relied on guess-and-check reasoning. Implications of this study advise
   the need for purposeful experiences within education programs that lead
   to better connections across disciplines of big ideas such as balance.},

Abstract = {The present study addresses the impact of the curriculum on primary
   school children's acquisition of clock-reading knowledge from analog and
   digital clocks. Focusing on Chinese and Flemish children's clock-reading
   knowledge, the study is about whether the differences in sequencing of
   learning and instruction opportunities-as defined by the
   curriculum-result in differences in accuracy and development of
   clock-reading knowledge. By means of (1) an in-depth qualitative
   analysis of the Chinese and Flemish mathematics curriculum standards and
   textbooks and (2) a quantitative analysis of 11,743 students' accuracy
   in reading the time, the current study mirrors the differential impact
   of alternative curriculum designs for primary education. The results of
   the analyses reveal that Chinese children acquire clock-reading
   knowledge-for analog and digital clocks-2 years earlier than their
   Flemish peers, due to a 2-year earlier exposure. Discussing these
   results, it is argued that the Flemish curriculum tends to underestimate
   what children are capable of and that clock-reading within the Flemish
   primary mathematics curriculum builds on dated assumptions and research
   results. Building on these outcomes, it is argued that curriculum
   development should be the result of collaborative inquiry involving
   policy makers, researchers, and teachers.},

Abstract = {In this study, we consider 5 preservice teachers who had negative views
   of mathematics at the beginning of elementary teacher education. We
   focus on methodological challenges: how to analyze their mathematical
   identity talk which to some readers can sound incoherent. Teacher change
   studies have often ignored the methodological challenges on which we
   focus on in this article. We compare preservice teachers' talk at the
   beginning and at the end of a mathematics education course. When
   analyzing the data, we combined discursive, rhetorical, and narrative
   approaches. We identified 6 central interpretative repertoires that were
   manifested in preservice teachers' identity talk: Victim, Ego-defensive,
   Fatalist, Gaining an Insight, Self-development, and Responding to the
   Expectations of the Change. The Ego-defensive and Fatalist repertoires
   were activated especially when students talked about mathematical tests.
   The most central rhetorical devices were category entitlement,
   categorization, active voicing, use of disclaimer, and use of metaphors
   or extreme utterances. At the end of the course, the talk of the more
   confident preservice teachers was more coherent than the others' talk.
   Our study shows that combining different approaches can bring useful
   views for understanding preservice teachers' multiple identities.},

Abstract = {During a sequence of tutorials conducted by the first author, it became
   evident that students were not seeing how to apply the theorem
   concerning a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval
   attaining its extreme values in situations in which it is necessary
   first to construct the closed and bounded interval by reasoning about
   properties concerning asymptotes. The paper describes 1 tutorial with 10
   students and a follow-up revision session with 2 of the students the
   same day concerning the use of this theorem in which the tutor used the
   pedagogic strategy of learner-generated examples. The students'
   responses and the tutor's observations are analysed using constructs of
   example spaces, structure of attention and dimensions of possible
   variation.},

Abstract = {Though it is generally believed that doing homework promotes better
   learning, no consensus has been achieved concerning its importance and
   relevance to students' achievement. The historical up-and-down status of
   public attitudes toward homework indicates that understanding about the
   role of homework in students' learning is far from comprehensive and
   clear. The literature shows that much research effort has been devoted
   to the relationship between amount of homework and achievement, but
   little on quality of homework and how it has been used. Applying a
   2-level hierarchical linear model on the TIMSS 2003 data, this study
   investigated the relationship between classroom practices on homework
   and 8th grade students' mathematics achievement in Hong Kong in three
   dimensions: frequency and amount of homework, types of homework, and
   usage modes of homework. The results showed that while the time spent on
   daily mathematics homework had significantly positive effect on
   students' TIMSS results, no effect was observed on the frequency of
   homework assigned. Out of three types of homework, only homework of the
   problem/question type demonstrated significant effect. The practice of
   having students start homework in class had negative influence on
   students' learning outcome. Implications and suggestions for educational
   practice and future research were then discussed.},

Abstract = {This study focused on accelerating development of science knowledge and
   understanding at the primary level (grades 1 - 2) as a means for
   enhancing reading comprehension (i.e. early literacy). An adaptation of
   a grade 3 - 5 cognitive-science-based, instructional model (Science
   IDEAS) that integrated science with reading and writing, this year-long
   study implemented daily 45-min instructional periods emphasizing
   in-depth, cumulative learning of science core-concept ``clusters{''}
   while integrating science and literacy in a manner that provided
   teachers with a thematic focus for all aspects of instruction. Results
   (a) confirmed the feasibility of implementing the integrated, in-depth
   science model at the primary level and (b) showed that experimental
   students obtained significantly higher achievement on Iowa Tests of
   Basic Skills Science and Reading tests than comparable controls.
   Discussed are curricular policy implications for increasing the
   instructional time for content-area instruction at the primary level.},

Abstract = {This study was a mixed quantitative-qualitative research to evaluate the
   efficacy of a designed student-centred instructional (DSCI) program for
   teaching about acids and bases. The teaching innovation was designed
   based on constructivist, hands-on inquiry and context-based approaches
   and implemented in seven 45-min lessons with a class of 36 grade 11
   students (experimental group) from a public senior high school in
   Indonesia. Another class of 38 students (comparison group) from the same
   school was instructed using a traditional teacher-centred approach. Data
   were obtained using a (1) 12-item achievement test on acids and bases
   that was administered to both groups as a pretest and a posttest, (2)
   self-evaluation 13-item questionnaire on students' perceptions of their
   competence and confidence in carrying out the inquiry activities that
   was administered to the experimental group and (3) 3-item open-ended
   questionnaire on students' perceptions of the instructional process
   using the DSCI that was administered to the experimental group. The
   results of the study showed that the teaching innovation was effective
   in improving students' understanding of acid-base concepts with
   significant difference between the two groups on the posttest mean
   scores. Moreover, the effectiveness of the innovation was supported by
   an increase in students' interest in learning science as indicated by
   their (1) positive perceptions of their engagement and competence in
   doing inquiry activities, (2) positive perceptions of the learning
   environment and (3) positive outcome expectations. The findings have
   implications for chemistry teaching in any institution with similar
   achieving students as well as for the professional development of
   teachers.},

Abstract = {Many factors influence a student's performance in word (or textbook)
   problem solving in class. Among them is the comprehension process the
   pupils construct during their attempt to solve the problem. The
   comprehension process may include some less formal representations,
   based on pupils' real-world knowledge, which support the construction of
   a `situation model'. In this study, we examine some factors related to
   the pupil or to the word problem itself, which may influence the
   comprehension process, and we assess the effects of the situation model
   on pupils' problem solving performance. The sample is composed of 750
   pupils of grade 6 elementary school. They were selected from 35 classes
   in 17 Francophone schools located in the province of Quebec, Canada. For
   this study, 3 arithmetic problems were developed. Each problem was
   written in 4 different versions, to allow the manipulation of the type
   of information included in the problem statement. Each pupil was asked
   to solve 3 problems of the same version and to complete a task that
   allowed us to evaluate the construction of a situation model. Our
   results show that pupils with weaker arithmetic skills construct
   different representations, based on the information presented in the
   problem. Also, pupils who give greater importance to situational
   information in a problem have greater success in solving the problem.
   The situation model influences pupils' problem solving performance, but
   this influence depends on the type of information included in the
   problem statement, as well as on the arithmetic skills of each
   individual pupil.},

Abstract = {This study aims at investigating the effects of a teaching intervention,
   the design of which is informed by evidence from educational theories
   and research data, on students' images of scientists. A
   quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent pre-test-post-test
   control group (CG) was used to compare the outcomes of the intervention.
   The subjects of the study were 63 grade 6 (aged 12 and 13) students who
   were in two different classes and taught by two different teachers. The
   study was undertaken in ten class hours over a 4-week period, during
   which the topics related to matter and heat concepts were covered as a
   part of the regular Turkish Science and Technology Curriculum. Before
   the intervention, there was no significant difference between the two
   classes in terms of their achievements in the Science and Technology
   course (t(63) = -0.943, p > 0.05). Accordingly, one of the classes was
   randomly selected as the experimental group (EG). A modified version of
   the Draw-a-Scientist Test, in conjunction with individual interviews,
   was used to assess students' images of scientists at the beginning and
   end of the study. The results showed that students who had followed
   evidence-informed instruction had significant gains from the pre-test to
   the post-test regarding their images of scientists compared to students
   with traditional instruction. Many students in the EG started to view
   scientists as realistic people rather than as extraordinary people or
   mythical creatures. Nevertheless, several students in the CG held images
   of scientists and their work which fit a stereotype of scientists as
   male, bald, bespectacled, wearing a laboratory coat, working alone in a
   laboratory environment and having a limited social life. Some possible
   implications for teaching and further research are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses a teaching dilemma faced by mathematics teachers in
   the Malaysian Chinese primary schools in coping with the latest changes
   in language policy. In 2003, Malaysia launched a new language policy of
   teaching mathematics using English as the language of instruction in all
   schools. However, due to the complex sociocultural demands of the
   Malaysian Chinese community, mathematics is taught in both Mandarin and
   English in the Malaysian Chinese primary schools. Teachers faced the
   dilemma of code-switching between English and Mandarin particularly in
   low-performing classes. A substantial amount of class time was spent in
   translating, especially the mathematical terminologies. Findings of this
   study imply that further research studies are needed to examine the
   effectiveness of teaching mathematics bilingually versus monolingually
   in a Malaysian context.},

Abstract = {This study examined science teachers' conceptions of creativity in
   science education, pedagogical ideas, and contextual factors perceived
   as constraints on teaching for creativity and any differences in the
   conceptions of teachers from South Korea and the United States.
   Participants in the study consisted of 44 South Korean and 21 US
   secondary science teachers. Data was collected from open-ended and
   Likert-type questionnaires. Results indicated that each individual
   teacher's conception was considerably limited, but the teachers'
   conceptions of creativity as a whole group were consistent with the
   literature. In terms of teaching methods for creativity, the teachers
   commonly emphasized problem-based or project-based inquiry which was
   consistent with the literature. The South Korean teachers tended to
   consider ethics as a more important criterion for judging creativity
   than the US teachers and emphasized providing thinking opportunity for
   fostering creativity, while the US teachers emphasized environmental or
   emotional support. Possible sources of these differences were discussed.
   The commonly mentioned constraints included pressure of content coverage
   for high-stakes tests, difficulties in assessing creativity, and class
   size. Suggestions for professional development of teachers and further
   research questions were made based on the findings.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this research was to explore the developmental
   process of and possible changes in beginning elementary mathematics
   teachers' efficacy. Beginning teachers with and without mathematics and
   science backgrounds were also compared to explore differences in their
   efficacy development. A multiple-case study method with a process and
   recursive design was employed in this study. The participants were six
   beginning elementary mathematics teachers purposefully selected from
   Taichung, Taiwan. Data were collected through interviews, recordings,
   observations, and reflection notes and then analyzed by immersion and
   editing analytic techniques. Based on the data analysis, a
   five-gradation developmental model and its characteristics of elementary
   beginning mathematics teacher efficacy was developed and proposed. The
   findings demonstrated the developmental process of this five-gradation
   model and its continuity and cyclical nature. Moreover, beginning
   mathematics teachers, who were at the same efficacy levels, tended to
   exhibit substantial similarities but slight differences in their
   developmental processes. This study also verified that the construct of
   internal and external factors played a significant role in cyclically
   contributing to continuous efficacy development. The implications of
   beginning mathematics teachers' efficacy and their professional
   development that derived from the findings and discussions were
   proposed, as well as a recommendation for further exploration on their
   efficacy development.},

Title = {PRESERVICE MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE TEACHERS IN AN INTEGRATED TEACHER
   PREPARATION PROGRAM FOR GRADES 7-12: A 3-YEAR STUDY OF ATTITUDES AND

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to describe a unique teacher
   licensure program for grades 7-12 that integrates mathematics, science,
   and technology education and (b) to explore the attitudes and
   perceptions related to the integration of mathematics, science, and
   technology education of three cohorts of preservice teachers enrolled in
   the first 3 years of the program. Eighty-one preservice teachers
   responded to a semantic differential to measure attitudes and
   perceptions related to ``mathematics, science, and technology education
   integration.{''} Principal components and internal consistency
   reliability analyses were computed to provide validity and reliability
   evidence. Preservice teachers also responded to one open-ended,
   free-response written question, ``What does the integration of
   mathematics, science, and technology education mean to you?{''}
   Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance with repeated measures
   and Pearson cross-tabulation chi-square analyses were computed to
   identify pretest-posttest differences for the value and difficulty
   scales, identified by the principal components analysis. Analytic
   inductive methods were used to identify emergent themes in student
   written responses to the open-ended question. Results indicated no
   change in preservice teacher attitudes and perceptions related to the
   value of integration-they clearly valued integration at the onset and
   completion of the program, often citing student benefits. However, a
   significant change in preservice teacher attitudes and perceptions
   related to difficulty was noted. Upon completion of the program,
   preservice teachers perceived integration to be more difficult and
   identified barriers and challenges-demonstrating a more realistic,
   practical, and cautious approach to the integration of mathematics,
   science, and technology education.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes measurement learning expectations involving area and
   volume in grades 1-8 across several U. S. states and high-performing
   TIMSS Asian countries, including Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan. Based on
   a review of official curriculum documents, results of this study
   indicate that the mathematics content, grade placement, and cognitive
   level of learning expectations related to selected measurement topics
   vary markedly across states and countries. This variability in learning
   expectations results in striking differences in students' opportunity to
   learn.},
