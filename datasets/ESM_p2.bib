Abstract = {Teacher educators' processes of establishing ``mathematics for
   teaching{''} in teacher education programs have been recognized as an
   important area for further research. In this study, we examine how two
   teacher educators establish and make explicit features of mathematics
   for teaching within classroom interactions. The study shows how the
   establishment of mathematics for teaching is dependent on the use of
   keywords from the mathematics education domain, the introduction of
   variation, and the use of generic communicative strategies. As such, the
   study could be seen as a contribution to ongoing research on how
   mathematics teacher educators interactively deal with mathematics for
   teaching.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we use the work of philosopher Gilles ChA cent telet to
   rethink the gesture/diagram relationship and to explore the ways
   mathematical agency is constituted through it. We argue for a
   fundamental philosophical shift to better conceptualize the relationship
   between gesture and diagram, and suggest that such an approach might
   open up new ways of conceptualizing the very idea of mathematical
   embodiment. We draw on contemporary attempts to rethink embodiment, such
   as Rotman's work on a ``material semiotics,{''} Radford's work on
   ``sensuous cognition{''}, and Roth's work on ``material
   phenomenology{''}. After discussing this work and its intersections with
   that of ChA cent telet, we discuss data collected from a research
   experiment as a way to demonstrate the viability of this new theoretical
   framework.},

Title = {Education and the illusions of emancipation},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {101-118},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this article, I deal with the question of emancipation in education.
   In the first part of the article, I argue that contemporary concepts of
   emancipation are explicitly or implicitly related to the idea of the
   sovereign subject articulated by Kant and other philosophers of the
   Enlightenment. I contend that our modern enlightened concepts of
   emancipation rest on a dichotomy between an autonomous and
   self-sufficient subject and its sociocultural world. Referring to
   current research in mathematics education, I show how this dichotomy
   leads to intrinsic contradictions that haunt ongoing educational
   practices. These contradictions, I contend, are manifested in the
   hopeless efforts to bridge the gap between the deeds and thoughts of an
   autonomous individual and the regimes of reason and truth in which the
   individual finds itself subsumed. In particular, I argue that
   emancipation as understood in the enlightened modern sense remains a
   chimeric and unfulfillable dream. In the second part of the article, I
   suggest that emancipation can still be an orienting vector of
   educational practice and research, but it needs to be conceptualized
   differently: emancipation needs not be predicated in terms of
   individuals' freedom and individualist autonomy, but in critical-ethical
   terms.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors provide an overview of mathematics
   education as a research domain, identifying and briefly discussing four
   shifts or historical moments. They illustrate how researchers working in
   various moments conceptualize not only the interactions among teachers,
   students, and mathematics differently but also teachers, students, and
   mathematics as subjects of inquiry as they ask different questions made
   possible by different theoretical perspectives. The authors then provide
   brief descriptions of critical theory and postmodern theory, and suggest
   critical postmodern theory as a hybrid theory that offers a praxis of
   uncertainty for reconceptualizing and conducting mathematics education
   research. They conclude by summarizing three research articles that they
   believe exemplify the empowering and humanizing uncertainties of how
   teachers, students, mathematics, and the multiplicity of interactions
   therein might indeed be reconceptualized with/in critical postmodern
   theory.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine sixth grade students' degree of
   conceptualization of fractions. A specially developed test aimed to
   measure students' understanding of fractions along the three stages
   proposed by Sfard (1991) was administered to 321 sixth grade students.
   The Rasch model was applied to specify the reliability of the test
   across the sample and cluster analysis to locate groups by facility
   level. The analysis revealed six such levels. The characteristics of
   each level were specified according to Sfard's framework and the results
   of the fraction test. Based on our findings, we draw implications for
   the learning and teaching of fractions and provide suggestions for
   future research.},

Abstract = {We present a model to analyze the students' activities of argumentation
   and proof in the graphical context of Elementary Calculus. The
   theoretical background is provided by the integration of Toulmin's
   structural description of arguments, Peirce's notions of sign,
   diagrammatic reasoning and abduction, and Habermas' model for rational
   behavior. Based on empirical qualitative analysis we identify three
   different kinds of semiotic actions featuring the organization of the
   argumentations, and related to different epistemological status of the
   arguments. In such semiotic actions, the students' argumentation and
   proof activities are managed and guided according to two intertwined
   modalities of control, which we call semiotic and theoretic control. The
   former refers to decisions concerning the selection and implementation
   of semiotic resources; the latter refers to decisions concerning the
   selection and implementation of a more or less explicit theory or parts
   of it. The structure of the model allows us to pinpoint a dialectical
   dynamics between the two.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to study students' difficulties when they
   have to ascribe the same meaning to different representations of the
   same mathematical object. We address two theoretical tools that are at
   the core of Radford's cultural semiotic and Godino's onto-semiotic
   approaches: objectification and the semiotic function. The analysis of a
   teaching experiment involving high school students working on the
   tangent, shows how students' difficulties in ascribing sense to
   different representations of a common mathematical object can be traced
   back to the kind of objectification processes and semiotic functions
   they are able to establish.},

   of diagrams in the solution of mathematical problems. Particularly, it
   is stated that diagrams facilitate the solution of mathematical problems
   because they represent problems' structure and information (Novick \&
   Hurley, 2001; Diezmann, 2005). Novick and Hurley were the first to
   introduce three well-defined types of diagrams, that is, network,
   hierarchy, and matrix, which represent different problematic situations.
   In the present study, we investigated the effects of these types of
   diagrams in non-routine mathematical problem solving by contrasting
   students' abilities to solve problems with and without the presence of
   diagrams. Structural equation modeling affirmed the existence of two
   first-order factors indicating the differential effects of the problems'
   representation, i.e., text with diagrams and without diagrams, and a
   second-order factor representing general non-routine problem solving
   ability in mathematics. Implicative analysis showed the influence of the
   presence of diagrams in the problems' hierarchical ordering.
   Furthermore, results provided support for other studies (e. g. Diezman
   \& English, 2001) which documented some students' difficulties to use
   diagrams efficiently for the solution of problems. We discuss the
   findings and provide suggestions for the efficient use of diagrams in
   the problem solving situation.},

Abstract = {Teachers' ability to accurately judge difficulties of mathematical tasks
   is an essential aspect of their diagnostic competencies. Although
   research has suggested that pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is
   positively correlated with the accuracy of diagnostic judgments,
   experimental studies have not been conducted to investigate how PCK
   affects perception and interpretation of relevant task characteristics.
   In an intervention study with a control group, 49 prospective
   mathematics teachers judged the difficulty of 20 tasks involving
   functions and graphs while an eye tracker tracked their eye movements.
   Some of the tasks included characteristics well known to be difficult
   for students. Participants' domain-specific PCK of typical student
   errors was manipulated through a three-hour intervention, during which
   they learned about the most common student errors in function and graph
   problems. We found that the process of perception (relative fixation
   duration on the relevant area in the tasks) was related to judgment
   accuracy. Pre-post comparisons revealed an effect of the intervention
   not only on participants' domain-specific PCK of typical student errors
   but also on their perception and interpretation processes. This result
   suggests that domain-specific PCK of typical student errors allowed
   participants to focus more efficiently on relevant task characteristics
   when judging mathematical task difficulties. Our study contributes to
   our understanding of how professional knowledge makes teachers' judgment
   processes of mathematical tasks more efficient.},

Title = {Lessons in paradise: envisioning a Black liberatory mathematics
   education},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 20},
Abstract = {I use Toni Morrison's Paradise as a backdrop for framing a Black
   Liberatory Fantasy (Martin et al., 2019) that is rooted in what Dumas
   and ross (Urban Education, 51(4):415-442, 2016) have conceptualized as
   BlackCrit. The goal of the current undertaking is to evaluate anecdotes
   of this working idea of paradise, to merge it with more refined ones,
   and to dream even bigger about what paradise could look like for Black
   students in mathematics spaces. It is with this backdrop that I proffer
   how to fashion a Black liberatory mathematics education (BLiME), my
   conception of paradise, where Black students are expected to exist in
   their full humanity. I offer up five characteristics that inform the
   BLiME framework and are an extension of Morrison's (2019) writings on
   paradise: beauty, plenty, rest, exclusivity, and eternity. I contend
   that Ruby, Morrison's town in Paradise, had elements of these
   characteristics, but here, BLiME reimagines mathematics education as a
   full embodiment of what Ruby had the potential to be.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we draw on our recent research to inspect again some of
   the theoretical perspectives we have been using to analyze data and to
   characterize teaching-learning in university settings. We focus
   particularly, within a sociocultural perspective on Activity Theory and
   the construct the ``Teaching Triad,{''} seeking to embed the Triad
   within an Activity Theory perspective. To achieve this, we relate the
   Teaching Triad with aspects of the sociocultural setting both in and
   beyond direct interactions in face-to-face teaching. While this is
   mainly a theoretical paper, an example is taken from observations of
   teaching in university lectures in a Greek university to show how these
   theoretical perspectives have provided insights to the institutional and
   cultural complexities involved and in what ways the Triad construct has
   evolved.},

Title = {Effect of algebraic language and problem text wording on problem model
   accuracy when solving age word problems},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Volume = {114},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-127},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The use of the algebraic method for solving word problems is a
   challenging topic for secondary school students. Students' difficulties
   are usually associated with extracting the problem's network of
   relationships between quantities and with formalizing these
   relationships into algebraic language in a problem model. Both sources
   can coexist and interact; thus, it is usually not possible to determine
   which source of difficulty is more relevant. In addition, there are
   specific errors, such as the error by multiple referents for the
   unknown, which are directly linked to the wording of the problem text,
   and in which the same two sources of error coexist. In this work, we
   present the results of an experiment conducted with 255 secondary school
   students assessing the effect of two common difficulties on the accuracy
   of problem models and on the rate of multiple referents for the unknown.
   The first difficulty is the use of algebraic language in the
   construction of the problem model; the second is the use of the same
   expression to designate different quantities within the problem text. We
   used a 2 x 2 between-between design, with one factor related to the
   symbolic language (algebraic or arithmetic) in which the problem model
   is constructed, and the other factor related to the actual language
   features of the text problem. Our results indicate that overall, the
   main source of difficulty for students is the use of algebraic language
   to formalize a problem model, representing a large effect size.},

Abstract = {Learning to interpret data in context is an important educational
   outcome. To assess students' attainment of this outcome, it is necessary
   to examine the interplay between their contextual and statistical
   reasoning. We describe a research method designed to do so. The method
   draws upon Toulmin's (1958, 2003) model of argumentation for the first
   stage of qualitative data analysis and the Structure of the Observed
   Learning Outcome (SOLO) (Biggs \& Collis, 1991) model for the second
   stage. Toulmin analyses help identify the justifications and expressions
   of uncertainty students provide in their interpretive arguments.
   Subsequent analyses based on the multi-modal conceptualization of SOLO
   help characterize the quality of student arguments relative to one
   another. Existing literature and an empirical example are drawn upon to
   explain how the Toulmin and SOLO models can be used in tandem to analyze
   students' interpretations of contextualized data. We also explain how
   pairing Toulmin and SOLO can address theoretical and practical
   limitations that arise when using just one of the two models on its own.},

Abstract = {Findings on children's proportional reasoning abilities strongly vary
   across studies. This might be due to the different contexts that can be
   used in proportional problems: fair-sharing, mixtures, and probability.
   A review of the scientific literature suggests that the context of
   proportional problems may not only impact the difficulty of the problem,
   but that it also plays an important role in how children approach the
   problems. In other words, different contexts might elicit different
   (erroneous) thinking strategies. The aim of the present study was to
   investigate the role of context in third graders' (n = 305) proportional
   reasoning abilities. Results showed that children performed
   significantly better in a fair-sharing context compared to a mixture and
   a probability context. No evidence was found for a difference in
   performance on the mixture and the probability context. However, the
   kind of erroneous answers that were given in the mixture and probability
   context differed slightly, with more additive answers in the mixture
   context and more one-dimensional answers in the probability context.
   These findings suggest that the type of answers elicited by proportional
   problems might depend on the specific context in which the problem is
   presented.},

Abstract = {Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, China, all school classes were
   delivered through an online environment from February 24 to May 22,
   2020. To support this transition, the Shanghai Education Commission led
   expert teachers and specialists to develop a series of online video
   lessons based on the Shanghai unified curriculum, and suggested students
   watch the online video lessons individually from home, followed by an
   online synchronous lesson supported by class teachers. This study
   investigated what primary mathematics teachers learned from addressing
   these challenges through a case study. By following two purposefully
   selected teachers over 2 weeks during the transition, multiple data sets
   including online video lessons, online synchronous lessons, daily
   reflections, and post-online teacher interviews were collected. A
   fine-grained analysis of the data from the lens of the documentational
   approach to didactics found that teachers adaptively used online video
   lessons as important resources for their online synchronous lessons and
   virtual Teaching Research Groups as a teachers' collaboration mechanism
   supported them to develop online video lessons and address various
   technological constraints. Finally, implications of this case study for
   mathematics education globally are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how different schools of thought in mathematics
   education think and speak about preparing mathematics for teaching by
   introducing and proposing certain metaphors. Among the metaphors under
   consideration here are the unpacking metaphor, which finds its origin in
   the Anglo-American school of thought of pedagogical reduction of
   mathematics; the elementarization metaphor, which has its origin in the
   German school of thought of didactic reconstruction of mathematics; and
   the recontextualization metaphor, which originates in the French school
   of thought of didactic transposition. The metaphorical language used in
   these schools of thought is based on different theoretical positions,
   orientations, and images of preparing mathematics for teaching. Although
   these metaphors are powerful and allow for different ways of thinking
   and speaking about preparing mathematics for teaching, they suggest that
   preparing mathematics for teaching is largely a one-sided process in the
   sense of an adaptation of the knowledge in question. To promote a more
   holistic understanding, an alternative metaphor is offered: preparing
   mathematics for teaching as ecological engineering. By using the
   ecological engineering metaphor, the preparation of mathematics for
   teaching is presented as a two-sided process that involves both the
   adaptation of knowledge and the modification of its environment.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop a descriptive phase model for
   problem-posing activities based on structured situations. For this
   purpose, 36 task-based interviews with pre-service primary and secondary
   mathematics teachers working in pairs who were given two structured
   problem-posing situations were conducted. Through an inductive-deductive
   category development, five types of activities (situation analysis,
   variation, generation, problem-solving, evaluation) were identified.
   These activities were coded in so-called episodes, allowing
   time-covering analyses of the observed processes. Recurring transitions
   between these episodes were observed, through which a descriptive phase
   model was derived. In addition, coding of the developed episode types
   was validated for its interrater agreement.},

Abstract = {Medical students generally learn to calculate drug doses using paper
   problems containing numerical information. In contrast, once qualified,
   they have to extract the relevant information from treatment guidelines
   and use equipment, such as syringes, to dose patients. We compared
   students' success in calculating drug doses using those different
   approaches. After receiving relevant training, 239 consenting first year
   students were randomised into four groups. Groups 1 and 2 had to
   calculate a dose, while groups 3 and 4 had to both calculate and then
   prepare a dose using a syringe and a labelled bottle of medicine. We
   gave groups 1 and 3 numerical dosage information. Groups 2 and 4 had to
   extract this information from guidelines. We compared success between
   groups using a chi-square test. Groups 1 and 3 outperformed groups 2 and
   4. Availability of equipment seemed to be related to the improved
   success between groups 2 and 4, but this was not significant. Students
   who did not speak English at home were three times more likely to answer
   incorrectly than English-speaking students. Students who had equipment
   were more likely than students who did not have equipment to use
   appropriate units and propose realistic quantities. In light of these
   findings, we recommend that medical student training and assessment
   should include both extraction of embedded dosage information from
   guidelines and use of the equipment used in dosing.},

Abstract = {Girls' underrepresentation in high-level post-compulsory mathematics is
   a longstanding issue of concern in many Western nations, with
   innumerable efforts to increase their participation producing little
   impact. In this paper, we shed new light on girls' underrepresentation
   through a post-structural feminist investigation of mathematics
   teachers' discursive constructions of high-level senior secondary
   mathematics students. Our analysis of semi-structured interviews with 22
   Australian mathematics teachers revealed gendered views that serve to
   exclude many students from the high-level mathematics student category.
   Most concerning was their recurring naturalised construction of
   successful high-level mathematics students as endowed with the right,
   invariably male, brain. In so doing, teachers repeatedly closed off the
   possibility of success to those lacking such a `mathematics gift',
   effectively `counting girls out'. We argue that increasing girls'
   participation in mathematics requires moving beyond current efforts to
   raise female interest and confidence to, more profoundly, disrupt
   enduring discourses of male superiority in mathematics.},

Abstract = {We investigated how US secondary mathematics teachers expect students to
   present geometric proofs at the board. We analyzed video records of
   geometry classrooms and found students to be engaged in a practice that
   we call proof transcription-i.e., mark-for-mark reproductions of
   previously completed proofs that were not reasoned reconstructions of
   arguments. To investigate whether or not US secondary mathematics
   teachers recognize transcriptions as routine occurrences when students
   presented proofs, we conducted a survey experiment. Participants (n =
   60) viewed episodes of instruction and answered questions that elicited
   their reactions to those episodes. The analysis of open- and
   closed-ended responses to the survey indicated that participants
   recognized transcriptions as routine. Our study contributes a
   fine-grained description of what teachers expect from students when
   students are called to present their work at the board.},

Abstract = {A great deal of progress has been made in dealing with the multiplicity
   and diversity of theories in mathematics education. However, relatively
   little attention has been paid to the opportunities offered by
   conflicts, tensions, and paradoxes among accepted yet opposing
   theoretical perspectives for theory building and theory advancement. In
   this paper, four modes of dealing with opposing perspectives are
   outlined: (1) taking contrasting theoretical perspectives as
   incommensurable; (2) holding opposites not as conflicting but as
   complementary; (3) dissolving or surpassing oppositions by blending
   perspectives; and (4) preserving paradoxes by recognizing the
   interdependence of constitutive oppositions. These four modes are
   illustrated by application to the long-standing debate of
   knowledge-in-structures versus knowledge-in-pieces and further
   exemplified by turning to the research literature on students'
   understanding of limit.},

Abstract = {The concept of determinant plays a central role in many linear algebra
   concepts and is also applied to other branches of mathematics and
   science. In this study, we focus on the application of determinant and
   inverse matrix concepts, in solving systems of equations by a group of
   116 in-service mathematics teachers who were studying the topic at a
   Zimbabwean university as part of a first course in linear algebra. The
   purpose of the study was to explore the role of prerequisite concepts of
   determinant and matrix inverse in solving systems of equations using the
   inverse matrix method. The Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS)
   theoretical framework was used to analyse the 116 participants' written
   responses to a questionnaire together with interview responses of 13 of
   the participants. Across the group of participants, it was found that
   only a small number had constructed prerequisite concepts of determinant
   and that of matrix inverse as Objects. The difficulties they had with
   prerequisite concepts prevented them from working more efficiently with
   the higher level concept of solving systems of equations using the
   inverse matrix method. These results suggest that instructors should
   help students consolidate their understanding of prerequisite concepts
   so that they are better placed to work with applications of these
   concepts.},

Abstract = {We employ Sfard's (Thinking as communicating, 2008) ritual towards
   exploration idea to theorize the learning trajectory of two middle
   school teachers attending a professional development (PD) program
   designed around the 5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Discussions
   and Accountable Talk. Data included four cycles of lesson recordings,
   including pre- and post-lesson interviews as well as recordings of all
   PD sessions. We operationalize ritual engagement in the teaching
   practices as rigid imitation of practices observed in the PD session and
   incoherence between teaching actions and underlying goals, whereas
   explorative engagement was characterized by flexibility and finer
   attunement of the practices to the context and to students' needs. The
   development from ritual to explorative participation could be seen both
   in the practice of task selection and in the practice of orchestrating
   mathematical discussions. The change is exemplified on two lessons,
   recorded two months apart from each other.},

Abstract = {Inspired by the entering of computer algebra systems (CAS) in the Danish
   upper secondary school mathematics program, this article addresses, from
   a theoretical stance, what may happen when traditional procedures are
   outsourced to CAS. Looking at the commands solve and desolve, it is
   asked what happens when such CAS procedures are objectified in the
   students' minds, and what the nature might be of the resulting objects.
   The theoretical analyses draw on a selection of classical mathematics
   education frameworks on conceptualization and are related to the
   research literature on technology in mathematics education. The article
   suggests the following characteristics as elements of negative effects:
   loss of distinctive features of concept formation, a consequential
   reclassification of mathematical objects, instability of CAS solutions
   as objects, and prevailing a posteriori reasoning on students' behalf
   when relying solely on CAS in their mathematical work.},

Title = {On the making of a new mathematics teacher: professional development,

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Volume = {100},

Abstract = {Reform-based discourses in mathematics education have fabricated
   different subjectivities for teachers such as the traditional and the
   new teacher. Professional development programs are proposed as effective
   mechanisms to fabricate the new teacher. However, this teacher has
   proved hard to produce. Thus, the resistor teacher has emerged into the
   field as a way to explain failure within school mathematics reform. In
   this article, I assume that resistance is a consequential response
   against particular forms of subjectivation imposed on mathematics
   teachers. Using conceptual tools from Hall and Foucault, I explore the
   ways wherein a high school mathematics teacher reinvents meanings of
   being a mathematics teacher in the context of a professional development
   program aimed to implement problem-solving instruction. Against the myth
   of the resistor teacher unwilling to change, what emerges is a process
   of struggle over meaning. School mathematics reform, considered as an
   ideological event, becomes a site in which competing meanings about
   being a mathematics teacher are negotiated, contested, and resisted.},

Title = {Towards conceptual coherence in the research on mathematics learner
   identity: a systematic review of the literature},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {99},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-42},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a systematic review of the empirical
   literature, reported in research journals, on Mathematics Learner
   Identity (MLI). In the mathematics education research field, arguments
   have been made that the conceptualization of Mathematics Identity (MI)
   is inconsistent and this makes the literature as a whole incoherent.
   This study aims to summarize how the concept has been employed and to
   develop an integrative model for analyzing concept-definitions and
   concept-operationalizations of MLI. An analysis of 69 papers revealed 3
   main dimensions that characterized how identity is conceptually defined
   in any research literature (social/subjective, enacted/representational
   and change/stability) and 5 main categories that describe how the
   literature has implemented these dimensions operationally (identity as
   individual attributes; identity as narratives; identity as a
   relationship with specific practices; identity as ways of acting; and
   identities as afforded and constrained by local practices). An emphasis
   on representational aspects of identities, particularly during higher
   education, and enacted and practice-related identities during primary
   and secondary education research was found. The discussion shows how the
   field would be clarified if studies made their choices of
   conceptualization clear in terms of these dimensions and categories, and
   if research as a whole becomes more aware of restrictions/limitations in
   identity research, particularly at different points of the educational
   trajectory of students.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use multimodality to examine how bilingual students
   interact with an area task from the National Assessment of Educational
   Progress in task-based interviews. Using vignettes, we demonstrate how
   some of these students manipulate the concrete materials, and use
   gestures, as a primary form of structuring their explanations and making
   mathematical meaning. We use our results as a basis to challenge the
   possible deficit perspective of bilingual students' mathematical
   knowledge in current assessment practices. Choosing tasks that afford
   multiple modes of engagement and recognizing multimodal explanations in
   assessment practices has the potential to move us towards a better
   understanding of what bilingual students know and can do mathematically.},

Abstract = {This paper finds its origins in a multidisciplinary research group's
   efforts to assemble a review of research in order to better appreciate
   how ``spatial reasoning{''} is understood and investigated across
   academic disciplines. We first collaborated to create a historical map
   of the development of spatial reasoning across key disciplines over the
   last century. The map informed the structure of our citation search and
   oriented an examination of connection across disciplines. Next, we
   undertook a network analysis that was based on highly cited articles in
   a broad range of domains. Several connection gaps-that is, apparent
   blockages, one-way flows, and other limitations on communications among
   disciplines-were identified in our network analysis, and it was apparent
   that these connection gaps may be frustrating efforts to understand the
   conceptual complexity and the educational significance of spatial
   reasoning. While these gaps occur between the academic disciplines that
   we evaluated, we selected a few examples for closer analysis. To
   illustrate how this lack of flow can limit development of the field of
   mathematics education, we selected cases where it is evident that
   researchers in mathematics education are not incorporating the important
   work of mathematicians, psychologists, and neuroscientists-and vice
   versa. Ultimately, we argue, a more pronounced emphasis on
   transdisciplinary (versus multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary)
   research might be timely, and perhaps even necessary, in the evolution
   of educational research.},

Abstract = {Motivated by the observation that formal logic answers questions
   students have not yet asked, we conducted exploratory teaching
   experiments with undergraduate students intended to guide their
   reinvention of truth-functional definitions for basic logical
   connectives. We intend to reframe the relationship between reasoning and
   logic by showing how logic emerges within students' mathematical
   activity. This activity entails reflecting on and systematizing their
   own language use across diverse semantic content. We present categories
   of students' untrained strategies for assessing the truth-values for
   mathematical disjunctions. Students' initial reasoning heavily reflected
   content-specific and pragmatic factors in ways inconsistent with the
   norms and conventions of mathematical logic. Despite this, all student
   groups reinvented the standard truth-functional definition for simple
   disjunctions. We demonstrate how this learning depended upon particular
   forms of reasoning about logic. We also contrast various strategies for
   assessing quantified disjunctions and their different affordances in
   students' mathematical activity.},

Volume = {93},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this article, we present a coding framework based on simultaneity and
   connections. The coding focuses on microlevel attention to three aspects
   of simultaneity and connections: between representations, within
   examples, and between examples. Criteria for coding that we viewed as
   mathematically important within part-whole additive relations
   instruction were developed. Teachers' use of multiple representations
   within an example, attention to part-whole relations within examples,
   and relations between multiple examples were identified, with teachers'
   linking actions in speech or gestures pointing to connections between
   these. In this article, the coding framework is detailed and exemplified
   in the context of a structural approach to part-whole teaching in six
   South African grade 3 lessons. The coding framework enabled us to see
   fine-grained differences in teachers' handling of part-whole relations
   related to simultaneity of, and connections between, representations and
   examples as well as within examples. We went on to explore the
   associations between the simultaneity and connections seen through the
   coding framework in sections of teaching and students' responses on
   worksheets following each teaching section.},

Abstract = {There is ample evidence that reasoning about stochastic phenomena is
   often subject to systematic bias even after instruction. Few studies
   have examined the detailed learning processes involved in learning
   probability. This paper examines a case study drawn from a large corpus
   of data collected as part of a research project that dealt with the
   construction of knowledge of probability at the junior high level while
   working on specifically designed activities. We discuss the dynamic
   construction of knowledge of a student who, while working on the task
   with a fellow student, learned to correctly predict the probability of
   getting a particular event in a two-dimensional sample space, although
   his initial intuitive take on the situation clearly conflicted with
   mathematical theory and empirical evidence. The student's learning is
   analyzed from the Knowledge in Pieces (KiP) epistemological perspective.
   We identify key knowledge elements, extend the Piagetian notion of
   accommodation through the activation and deactivation of these knowledge
   elements, and discuss the accommodation of a particular knowledge system
   that informs the perception of real-world situations as instances of a
   simple event in probability theory.},

Abstract = {This study situates children's early notions of average within an
   inquiry classroom to investigate the rich inferential reasoning that
   young children drew on to make sense of the questions: Is there a
   typical height for a student in year 3? If so, what is it? Based on
   their deliberations over several lessons, students' ideas about average
   and typicality evolved as meaning reasonable, contrary to atypical, most
   common (value or interval), middle, normative, and representative of the
   population. The case study reported here documents a new direction for
   the development of children's conceptions of average in a classroom
   designed to elicit their informal inferential reasoning about data.},

Abstract = {Research on learner errors in mathematics education is beginning to
   focus on how teachers can learn to identify and engage with the
   reasoning behind these errors. Research on professional learning
   communities is beginning to show that they present powerful
   opportunities for on-going teacher collaboration and learning. In this
   paper, I bring the two areas of research together. Drawing on data from
   one professional learning community in the Data Informed Practice
   Improvement Project, I show how teachers in this community came to
   understand key concepts about learner errors and shifted their ways of
   talking about learner errors. I identify three important shifts that the
   teachers made in their learning about learner errors: from identifying
   to interpreting errors; from interpreting to engaging errors; and from
   focusing on learner errors to focusing on their own knowledge. I argue
   that these three shifts suggest a deepening of teachers' thinking in
   relation to learner errors.},

Abstract = {Research on identity has been a growing domain in the contexts of
   teacher education and mathematics education; however, identity work has
   been explored to a much lesser extent, with a future orientation
   overlooked. In addition, earlier studies have not provided sufficient
   knowledge on how different elementary teacher education programs might
   facilitate pre-service teachers' identity work. In this study, we
   compare future-oriented mathematical identity work through a narrative
   framework considering six pre-service teachers undergoing two different
   teacher education programs. All pre-service teachers reported having had
   negative experiences with mathematics during their school years. Based
   on the results we conclude that despite the striking similarities in
   pre-service teachers' mathematical backgrounds, the ways in which these
   cases are conducting their identity work differ substantially. It seems
   that the main reasons for these differences are different emphases and
   pedagogical practices in mathematics education courses. Additionally, we
   further elaborate on our earlier conceptualisation of identity work.},

Abstract = {Research shows that students, and sometimes teachers, have trouble with
   fractions, especially conceiving of fractions as numbers that extend the
   whole number system. This paper explores how fractions are addressed in
   undergraduate mathematics courses for prospective elementary teachers
   (PSTs). In particular, we explore how, and whether, the instructors of
   these courses address fractions as an extension of the whole number
   system and fractions as numbers in their classrooms. Using a framework
   consisting of four approaches to the development of fractions found in
   history, we analyze fraction lessons videotaped in six mathematics
   classes for PSTs. Historically, the first two approaches-part-whole and
   measurement-focus on fractions as parts of wholes rather than numbers,
   and the last two approaches-division and set theory-formalize fractions
   as numbers. Our results show that the instructors only implicitly
   addressed fraction-as-number and the extension of fractions from whole
   numbers, although most of them mentioned or emphasized these aspects of
   fractions during interviews.},

Abstract = {Symbolic power is discussed with reference to mathematics and formal
   languages. Two distinctions are crucial for establishing mechanical and
   formal perspectives: one between appearance and reality, and one between
   sense and reference. These distinctions include a nomination of what to
   consider primary and secondary. They establish the grammatical format of
   a mechanical and a formal world view. Such views become imposed on the
   domains addressed by means of mathematics and formal languages. Through
   such impositions symbolic power of mathematics becomes exercised. The
   idea that mathematics describes as it prioritises is discussed with
   reference to robotting and surveillance. In general, the symbolic power
   of mathematics and formal languages is summarised through the
   observations: that mathematics treats parts and properties as
   autonomous, that it dismembers what it addresses and destroys the
   organic unity around things, and that it simplifies things and reduces
   them to a single feature. But, whatever forms the symbolic power may
   take, it cannot be evaluated along a single good-bad axis.},

Abstract = {This analysis of the writing in a grade 7 mathematics textbook
   distinguishes between closed texts and open texts, which acknowledge
   multiple possibilities. I use tools that have recently been applied in
   mathematics contexts, focussing on grammatical features that include
   personal pronouns, modality, and types of imperatives, as well as on
   accompanying structural elements such as photographs and the number of
   possibilities presented. I extend this discussion to show how even texts
   that appear open can seduce readers into feeling dialogue while actually
   leading them down a narrow path. This phenomenon points to the
   normalizing power of curriculum. For this analysis and reflection, I
   draw on mathematics textbook material that I wrote. As a way of
   modelling an alternative to normalization, I identify myself as a
   self-critical author and thus invite readers to be critical of their
   reading and writing of mathematics texts.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined special education students' use of indirect
   addition (subtraction by adding on) for solving two-digit subtraction
   problems. Fifty-six students (8- to 12-year-olds), with a mathematical
   level of end grade 2, participated in the study. They were given a
   computer-based test on subtraction with different types of problems.
   Although most students had not been taught indirect addition for solving
   subtraction problems, they frequently applied this procedure
   spontaneously. The item characteristics were the main prompt for using
   indirect addition. Context problems that reflect an adding-on situation
   and problems that have a small difference between the minuend and
   subtrahend most strongly elicited the use of the indirect addition
   procedure. Moreover, indirect addition was identified as a highly
   successful procedure for special education students, and the best
   predictor of a correct answer was found in combination with a stringing
   strategy.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a teaching experiment in which two students engaged
   in tasks that challenged them to describe a final state for a variety of
   infinite iterative processes. The results from the study indicate that
   the students used multiple reasoning strategies for addressing these
   tasks. Refinements in the students' reasoning occurred as students
   constructed relationships between the problems they were solving and
   problems they had solved previously, applying some of the reasoning
   strategies that they used for one problem to make sense of or solve
   another problem. We discuss how these findings relate to the existing
   body of research on infinite iterative processes.},

Abstract = {The comments below are meant to show that considerations of public and
   private realms and the tension between these realms arise in a natural
   and persistent way in discussions connected with semiotics. In
   particular, they arise out of the themes of body and sociocultural
   mathematical meaning-making, which are recurring themes of the papers in
   this volume. The public-private dichotomy is related to other
   dichotomies such as those between outer and inner and collective and
   individual. For educators, such dichotomies are important in that they
   reflect the division between students' own inner and individual
   understandings of mathematical ideas and their functioning within a
   shared sociocultural world of mathematical meanings.},

Abstract = {Developing deep conceptual understanding of what Ma (1999) calls
   fundamental mathematics is a well-accepted goal of teacher education.
   This paper presents a microanalysis of an intriguing episode within a
   course designed to encourage such understanding. An adaptation of
   Krummheuer's (1995) elaboration of Toulmin's (1958/2003) diagrams is
   used to examine video recordings and transcripts of a group of graduate
   students in secondary mathematics education grappling with the idea of a
   three-dimensional line having negative slope. The graduate students'
   understandings of slope are examined using an expansion of Stump's
   (1999, 2001b) categories of conceptions of slope. The episode ends in an
   interesting impasse, in which the graduate students agree to pursue the
   idea no further, purposely ignoring the question of negative slope,
   despite the clear intention of the task. The analysis explores the
   argumentation, factors of the learning environment, and conceptions of
   slope that may have contributed to this impasse.},

Abstract = {This study investigated mathematics teachers' professional knowledge
   among elementary school teachers exposed to a professional training
   program that either supported self-regulated learning (SRL) or offered
   no SRL support (no-SRL). The SRL support was based on the IMPROVE
   metacognitive self-questioning method that directs students' attention
   to understanding when, why, and how to solve problems (Kramarski and
   Mevarech, Am Educ Res J 40:281-310, 2003). Sixty-four Israeli elementary
   teachers participated in a month-long professional development program
   to enhance mathematical and pedagogical knowledge. The course was part
   of a 3-year professional development program sponsored by the Israeli
   Ministry of Education. This mixed-method study included quantitative
   assessments of teachers' professional knowledge in mathematical problem
   solving for an authentic task based on Program for International Student
   Assessment's framework (Program for International Student Assessment,
   2003) and in lesson planning, as well as qualitative interviews and
   videotaped observations of two teachers. Results indicated that teachers
   in the SRL program outperformed those in the no-SRL program on various
   problem solving skills (e. g., reflection and conceptual mathematical
   explanations) and lesson planning (e. g., task demands and teaching
   approach). Videotaped observations of actual teaching indicated that the
   SRL-trained teacher demonstrated more teaching practices that aimed to
   promote students' understanding and better supported students'
   regulation of their own learning, compared to the no-SRL-trained
   teacher. We discuss educational and practical implications.},

Abstract = {Mathematical concepts and conceptions have been theorized as
   abstractions from-and therefore transcending-bodily and embodied
   experience. In this contribution, we re-theorize mathematical
   conceptions by building on recent philosophical work in dialectical
   phenomenology. Accordingly, a conception exists only in, through, and as
   of the experiences that the individual realizes it. To exemplify our
   reconceptualization of mathematical conceptions, we draw on an episode
   from a study in a second-grade classroom where the students learned
   about three-dimensional geometrical objects.},

Title = {Multiple pathways for developing functional thinking in elementary

Abstract = {The mathematics education literature indicates a consensus regarding the
   importance of developing algebraic thinking in elementary school
   mathematics. However, the approaches used to implement this concept vary
   around the world. This study examines how a popular standards-based
   elementary mathematics textbook series in China provides opportunities
   to learn about functional thinking, which is a key component of
   algebraic thinking. Building on the literature, an analytical framework
   was generated to examine the features of function-related tasks in the
   textbook series across grades. The results of the fine-grained coding
   analysis show that four categories of function-related tasks in the
   textbook provide opportunities to learn about multi-modes of functional
   thinking. These tasks primarily serve to enhance arithmetic learning,
   while offering opportunities to learn about functional thinking as an
   embedded component. Elaborated design and arrangement of the function
   tasks promote opportunities to learn about multiple modes of functional
   thinking. In addition, two pathways to support the development of
   functional thinking are identified. Finally, the implications for task
   design and textbook development which attempt to develop functional
   thinking are discussed.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the commognitive framework, we construe the
   secondary-tertiary transition (STT) as a distinctive element in the
   pedagogical discourses of various communities. Our interest rests with
   university tutors in light of the emergent recognition of their impact
   on undergraduates' mathematics learning in many tertiary contexts
   worldwide. We aim to understand the roles of STT communication in
   tutors' reflections on incidents that took place in their tutorials. Our
   participants were undergraduate students in the advanced stages of their
   mathematics degrees in a large New Zealand university and who were
   enrolled in a mathematics education course. Throughout the semester, the
   participants led tutorial sessions for first-year students and wrote
   reflections on classroom incidents that drew their attention. Our data
   corpus consisted of 58 reflections from 38 tutors collected over four
   semesters. The analysis revealed that STT communication featured in
   tutors' descriptions of classroom incidents, assisted them in making
   sense of unexpected events, positioned their instructional actions as
   replications of what was familiar to them from their own STT experience,
   and contributed toward generating new pedagogical narratives. We situate
   these findings in the literature concerning undergraduate tutoring and
   teachers' perspectives on STT.},

Title = {The integration of undergraduate students' informal and formal

Abstract = {Since statistical inference is a probabilistic generalization about a
   population analyzed on the basis of a sample, inferential reasoning
   demands producing reasons (statistical and contextual) to substantiate
   and validate generalizations. To convey an understanding of students'
   inferential reasoning, we present a proposal-based on Toulmin's
   argumentation model-in which the production of statistical and
   contextual reasons serve as fundamental components of students'
   inferential reasoning by providing supporting arguments that can be
   expressed as a sequence of statements. We analyze the inferential
   reasoning of university students asked to work in teams on an
   inferential activity in the context of environmental pollution. Results
   show that they integrated informal and formal methods to produce
   statistical reasons, complemented by contextual reasons to support their
   conclusions. Their reasoning model allowed us to identify (a) a
   potential transition from informal to formal inferential reasoning; and
   (b) ambiguity, or an absence of expressions of uncertainty, about
   generalizations regarding the population, possibly related to their
   confidence in using formal methods (e.g., hypothesis testing). We
   conclude that our proposal helps encourage and analyze students'
   inferential reasoning. Future research will require clearer definitions
   of the characteristics of the argumentation model in the field of
   statistical inferential reasoning because arguments depend on their
   disciplinary context.},

Abstract = {Mathematical Internet memes are examples of how the creative thrust
   characterising the Web 2.0 environment reaches the field of mathematics,
   translating mathematical statements into a new digital form endowed with
   an epistemic potential that is capable of initiating a process of
   mathematical argumentation. The research presented in this paper aims to
   shed light on the creative process of mathematical memes, contributing
   to building a body of knowledge on mathematical memes that,
   prospectively, could enable educators to profit from these objects in
   their teaching. Theoretically, this is based on a widened concept of
   creativity that focuses on the connection linking digital culture with
   mathematics, and on distinguishing and merging three perspectives to
   disclose the meanings of mathematical memes. Methodologically, the
   process of mathematical memes' creation is investigated through a
   reverse engineering approach on a dataset of about 2100 items collected
   in a 3-year-long ethnographic observation within online communities. The
   result is a heuristic action model of the creation process, that is
   validated by creating two new mathematical Internet memes that are
   shared online within the observed communities to explore if they retain
   the mathematical and epistemic characteristics of Web-found ones.},

Abstract = {In this article, we document the support provided by highly recognised
   journals in Mathematics Education in response to the challenges faced by
   English non-dominant language (EnDL) authors when they attempt to
   publish in English. To address this issue, we first conducted a
   synthesis of research literature related to those influences that direct
   EnDL authors' publication efforts towards English language journals and
   the associated challenges that result. Second, we gathered survey and
   interview data from participant editors-in-chief of leading journals in
   Mathematics Education about the support, enacted and planned, provided
   by their journal for EnDL authors and associated challenges. Finally, we
   discuss the findings of the study from the perspective of heteroglossia.
   Findings indicate that while a range of initiatives have been employed
   to support EnDL authors, current journal policies lag somewhat behind
   the plans of editors-in-chief, which have been limited, to date, by
   available resources.},

Abstract = {In this article, we direct attention to what becomes critical in
   teaching activities for toddlers (1-3-year-olds) to learn the meaning of
   numbers. One activity we thoroughly explore is interactive book reading,
   based on previous research indicating positive learning outcomes from
   this type of mathematical activity, as it has shown to simultaneously
   embrace the child's perspective and encourage interaction and `number
   talk.' A specially designed picture book presenting small quantities was
   developed, and variation theory principles were embedded in both the
   book design and the teaching acts. Through qualitative analyses, we aim
   to identify what is critical in the interactive book reading sessions
   for toddlers to discern essential aspects of numbers, with a specific
   focus on the conditions for making modes of representations into
   resources for learning. Preschool teachers frequently read the book to
   27 toddlers over the course of a year. Video documentation of their
   reading sessions was analyzed, and exposed the significance of
   addressing the child's perspective when choosing what representation to
   emphasize and in what ways connections within and between
   representations can be made. Thus, the study contributes knowledge on
   the teaching of numbers with toddlers, and problematizes as well as
   extends the potential of interactive book reading as a quality-enhancing
   educational tool.},

Abstract = {Within educational research, dyslexia and other disabilities are
   typically conceptualized as deficits. The theory of neurodiversity
   encourages researchers to conceptualize cognitive differences as natural
   forms of human diversity with unique sets of challenges and strengths.
   Using neurodiversity as our theoretical framework, we analyze the
   experiences of five research mathematicians with dyslexia as told
   through personal narratives to find common strengths and challenges for
   dyslexic thinkers at the highest level of mathematics. We report on 4
   themes: (1) highly visual and intuitive ways of mathematical thinking,
   (2) issues with language and translation between forms, (3) issues with
   memorization of mathematical facts and procedures, and (4) resilience as
   a strength of dyslexia that matters in mathematics. We use our
   participants' insights to explore how neurodiversity, a theory of
   cognitive disability developed by and for neurodiverse people, could
   expand opportunities for research. We call for mathematics educators to
   consider the strengths and challenges of dyslexic learners, as well as
   valuing expertise from insider perspectives.},

Abstract = {Argu mentative problem solving in mathematics classrooms is a crucial
   practice that supports important student learning goals via
   collaborative deliberation and consensus building, but also places
   substantial cognitive and affective demands on both students and
   teacher. In this in-depth qualitative study, we considered how students'
   emotions during argumentative discourse relate to their learning of
   real-life functional situations, an area of mathematics highlighted in
   the literature as foundational yet difficult. Observations, written
   reflections, and interviews of six Year 9 (14-15-year-old) students'
   experience of argument construction, critique, and consensus building
   were analyzed for insights into emotions experienced during small-group
   argumentative problem solving, and how various emotions might support or
   hinder students' mathematics learning. The emotion of frustration was
   experienced frequently and was found to facilitate persistence and the
   correction of misconceptions, but also to hinder the learning in
   contributing to ongoing tension and eventual resignation. Peer critique
   was found to stimulate negative emotions but positive learning
   processes, such as seeking other ways to explain one's reasoning, and
   re-evaluating one's own incorrect solutions.},

Abstract = {Problems teaching probability in Tonga (in the South Pacific) led to the
   question on how language and culture affect the understanding of
   probability and uncertainty. The research uses a discursive approach to
   identify the endorsed narratives which underlie Tongans' reasoning in
   situations of uncertainty. I aim to justify the claim that the Tongan
   language and the Tongan way of life interact to make the concept of
   uncertainty very different from that found in western countries and the
   concept of probability almost redundant in Tongan day-to-day discourse.
   There are very few cross-cultural studies concerning the ways in which
   probability and uncertainty are understood in different cultural
   contexts, and this article aims to make a small contribution to filling
   this gap.},

Abstract = {The use of authentic real-world problems that reflect the applied nature
   of mathematics is not prevalent in formal secondary school settings. In
   this study, we explore the interface between workplace mathematics,
   particularly tech-related real-world (TRW) problems, and school
   mathematics, through the explication of mathematical modeling. The
   research questions are (1) in which tech domains can real-world problems
   be identified that can be addressed using mathematical modeling for the
   secondary school level? (2) Which methods do engineers use to simplify
   tech-related problems for non-experts in their field? (3) In which areas
   in the secondary mathematics curriculum can TRW problems be mapped? We
   present a three-phase model which yielded the creation of a pool of 169
   TRW problems. The first two phases of the model included extracting
   authentic problems from the work of tech engineers and simplifying them
   to be meaningful or perceivable to students. These were explored by
   conducting task-oriented interviews with senior tech engineers and
   scientists from leading companies and universities. The third phase was
   accomplished by interviewing mathematics education experts, and included
   verifying the compatibility of the problems with the formal,
   secondary-level mathematics curriculum. The study has methodological,
   theoretical, and practical contributions. These include methodology that
   enables identifying TRW problems that are compliant with the secondary
   mathematics curriculum; adding to the literature about mathematical
   modeling by demonstrating the interface between workplace mathematics
   and school mathematics; and creating a large pool of TRW problems that
   can be used in secondary school math lessons.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {105},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-70},

Abstract = {This paper reports the results of an international comparative study
   conducted in Switzerland and Japan of an elementary school mathematics
   lesson. The principal aim of the study was to advance understanding of
   the cultural specificities of a mathematics lesson in its totality using
   concrete examples of lesson design and implementation and of how
   cultural factors within and beyond the classroom/school shape and
   produce mathematics lessons in a particular country. We analysed two
   Grade 4 mathematics lessons designed and implemented in Switzerland and
   Japan by pre-service teachers in the context of a project-based
   international exchange programme. The lesson, initially designed
   collaboratively by the pre-service teachers of the two countries, was
   ultimately realised in different ways in each country. Specifically, we
   found differences between the Japanese and Swiss lessons in the
   structure of the lesson and validation of solutions. To elucidate these
   differences and identify the cultural factors that yield them, we
   analysed the resources developed and used during lesson design and
   implementation (lesson plans, official documents, and textbooks).
   Furthermore, we discuss three aspects of mathematics lessons that
   account for the main characteristics of each lesson: collective or
   individualistic teaching and learning, problem-solving lessons, and
   distance between theory and practice.},

   exploring its role in curricular guidelines and in classroom life. By
   means of a joke on precision delivered by a school student in South

Abstract = {This paper reports changes of the quality of instruction and students'
   attitudes towards mathematics at one high school during 3 years while
   teachers participated in a teacher community. The setting for this
   research was a small-sized high school in South Korea with 154 students
   and three mathematics teachers. I analyzed the teachers' mathematics
   classes based on types of interaction, types of questions, and
   mathematical quality in instruction. Their students' responses for the
   National Assessment of Educational Achievement study about attitudes
   towards mathematics were also analyzed. The findings show that this
   school, over all, improved the mathematical quality and changed the
   types of questions and the types of interactions towards students'
   participation in discussing, exploring, and probing mathematical
   meanings. The students' attitudes towards mathematics became more
   positive throughout the 3-year period. However, the changes in each
   teacher's mathematics instruction were different. This study discusses
   the challenges of having an effective teacher community and researching
   teachers as learners.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {In this paper, we offer a comparative review of research on
   understanding and promoting students' mathematical thinking. The sources
   for the review are papers that were published in Educational Studies in
   Mathematics (ESM) during two windows of time: 1994-1998 and 2014-2018.
   Selection of these two time periods enables us to comment on the ``state
   of the art{''} in research as well as identify changes over the past 25
   years. The review is guided by an analysis of conceptualizations of
   ``mathematical thinking{''} proposed in the research literature,
   selected curriculum documents, and international assessment programs
   such as the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment
   (PISA). The review not only documents salient features of research
   studies, such as the country of origin of the authors, educational level
   of the participants, research aims, theoretical perspectives, and
   methodological approaches, but also identifies the contribution to
   knowledge made by this body of work as well as future research
   directions and opportunities.},

Abstract = {In any procedural mathematical situation, there are multiple ways of
   achieving the same answer. Given this observation, we ask, why choose
   one procedural solution over another? We address this question here with
   data drawn from interviews conducted with university students engaged in
   row-reducing matrices. During their tasks, the students voiced a variety
   of justifications for the procedural steps they enacted. Through a
   phenomenographical analysis (Marton, Instructional Science, 10, 177-200,
   1981) of their utterances, we construct a framework for justifications
   for choices made within procedures with two broad categories,
   algorithmic and anticipatory. By comparison, this is similar to the
   creative/imitative reasoning framework of Lithner (Educational Studies
   in Mathematics, 67, 255-276, 2008), a framework primarily emerging from
   less procedural settings. We suggest that, given this richness in
   justifications brought forth by a procedural setting, when used
   effectively, instruction in mathematical procedures has the potential to
   contribute to deeper, more flexible forms of mathematical knowledge
   overall.},

Abstract = {Educators and several national standards highlight the role that problem
   solving should play in students' mathematics education: problem solving
   is recognized as one of the most significant activities of doing
   mathematics. From the research point of view, nowadays, it is well
   established that cognitive and affective factors come into play in
   problem solving activities, but some affective issues remain unexplored.
   In particular, we want to study pupils' attitudes towards (mathematical)
   problems, analyzing their evolution from kindergarten (where the word
   mathematics' is rarely explicitly mentioned) to primary school. In a
   well-defined affective theoretical framework, where attitude is a
   three-dimensional construct including beliefs and emotions, we carried
   out a qualitative and narrative study involving 284 students of seven
   different Italian schools: 121 from kindergarten and grade 1 and 163
   from grade 3 to 5. Analyzing the qualitative data collected, we
   described primary students' attitudes towards problems and we compared
   these with those developed in kindergarten, where the word mathematics'
   is not explicitly mentioned.},

Abstract = {There are currently many mathematics anxiety rating scales designed
   typically for adult and older children populations, yet there remains a
   lack of assessment tools for younger children (<7years of age) despite a
   recent focus on this age range. Following previous testing and
   validation, the 26-item iteration of the Children's Mathematics Anxiety
   Scale UK (CMAS-UK) for ages 4-7years was further validated with 163
   children (4-7years) across two schools in the UK to test the validity
   and reliability of the items through subsequent exploratory and
   confirmatory factor analysis. The predictive validity of the scale was
   also tested by comparing scale scores against mathematics performance on
   a mathematics task to determine the relationship between scale and
   mathematics task scores. Exploratory factor analysis and associated
   parallel analysis indicated a 19-item scale solution with appropriate
   item loadings (>0.45) and high internal consistency (=0.88). A single
   factor model of Online Mathematics Anxiety was related to the experience
   of an entire mathematics lesson, from first entering the classroom to
   completing a task. A significant negative correlation was observed
   between the CMAS-UK and mathematics performance scores, suggesting that
   children who score high for mathematics anxiety tend to score to perform
   less well on a mathematics task. Subsequent confirmatory factor analysis
   was conducted to test a range of module structures; the shortened
   19-item CMAS-UK was found to have similar model indices as the 26-item
   model, resulting in the maintenance of the revised scale. To conclude,
   the 19-item CMAS-UK provides a reliable assessment of children's
   mathematics anxiety and has been shown to predict mathematics
   performance. This research points towards the origins of mathematics
   anxiety occurring when number is first encountered and supports the
   utility of the CMAS-UK. Subsequent research in the area should consider
   and appropriately define an affective component that may underlie
   mathematics anxiety at older ages. Mathematics anxiety relates to more
   complex procedures that elude the experiences of younger children and
   may instead be the result of number-based experiences in the early years
   of education.},

Abstract = {This article concerns student sense making in the context of algebraic
   activities. We present a case in which a pair of middle-school students
   attempts to make sense of a previously obtained by them position formula
   for a particular numerical sequence. The exploration of the sequence
   occurred in the context of two-month-long student research project. The
   data were collected from the students' drafts, audiotaped meetings of
   the students with the teacher and a follow-up interview. The data
   analysis was aimed at identification and characterization of the
   algebraic activities in which the students were engaged and the
   processes involved in the students' sense-making quest. We found that
   sense-making process consisted of a sequence of generational and
   transformational algebraic activities in the overarching context of a
   global, meta-level activity, long-term problem solving. In this
   sense-making process, the students: (1) formulated and justified claims;
   (2) made generalizations, (3) found the mechanisms behind the algebraic
   objects (i.e., answered why-questions); and (4) established coherence
   among the explored objects. The findings are summarized as a suggestion
   for a four component decomposition of algebraic sense making.},

Abstract = {The researchers in this study investigated the impact of
   mathematics-focused parental involvement on Kindergarten to Grade 8
   children and parents as well as factors prompting that impact.
   Qualitative analysis consisting of parent, child, and teacher interviews
   and 3-year quantitative testing showed significant improvements in
   students' mathematics understanding and achievement. Moreover parents
   and teachers improved on measures of content knowledge. We hypothesize
   that improved parent content and pedagogical knowledge and improved
   parent-child interactions around mathematics stimulate children to learn
   at school. Furthermore, we found aspects of parent knowledge and
   dispositions gained to be analogous to teacher MKT; we termed these
   aspects Mathematical Knowledge for Parental Involvement. Such aspects
   include content knowledge, valuing students' own strategies, and
   listening to students' explanations and may boost student achievement in
   mathematics.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we draw on the contemporary perspective of inclusive
   materialism offered by de Freitas and Sinclair to contribute to current
   discussions on the role of the body in the learning of mathematics.
   Using the notions of distributed agency and assemblage, we illustrate
   the way in which three students engage with a patterning task. We
   discuss this as an example to show how the mathematics activity
   involves, besides the students' bodies, other materialities that
   populate the classroom, and how all the human and non-human bodies form
   a moving assemblage that constantly reconfigures and reorients learning.
   The inclusive materialism helps us talk about learning as a dynamic
   assemblage rather than in terms of individual achievements and directs
   attention to the material learning environment.},

Abstract = {The relationships between mathematics, mathematics education and issues
   such as social justice and equity have been addressed by the
   sociopolitical tradition in mathematics education. Others have
   introduced explicit discussion of ethics, advocating for its centrality.
   However, this is an area that is still under developed. There is a need
   for an ethics of mathematics education that can inform moment to moment
   choices to address a wide range of ethical situations. I argue that
   mathematics educators make ethical choices which are necessarily
   ambiguous and complex. This is illustrated with examples from practice.
   The concept of ethical dimension is introduced as a heuristic to
   consider the awareness of different forms of relationship and arenas of
   action. A framework is proposed and discussed of four important
   dimensions: the relationship with others, the societal and cultural, the
   ecological and the relationship with self. Attending to the different
   ethical dimensions supports the development of a plural relational
   ethics. Navigating ethical complexity requires embracing diverse and
   changing commitments. An ethics that takes account of these different
   dimensions supports an ethical praxis that is based on principles of
   flexibility and a dialogical relationship to the world and practice.},

Abstract = {Learning experiences regarding the line of best fit are typically
   students' first encounters with the fundamental topic of statistical
   association. Students bring with them into these learning experiences
   prior knowledge and experiences about mathematical lines and their
   properties, namely slope. This study investigated the role students'
   conceptions of slope play in their conceptualization of the line of best
   fit and approaches to placing it informally (i.e., by eye). Task-based
   interviews concerning the meaning and placement of the line of best fit
   conducted with seven grade 8 students were analyzed for this study. The
   results showed that students' conceptualizations of slope can play a
   significant role in their reasoning about the line of best fit, in both
   productive and unproductive ways. Analysis of associations between slope
   conceptualizations and students' criteria for placing the line, accuracy
   of the placed line, and meaning of the line of best fit are presented.
   The discussion highlights implications of the study for the teaching of
   lines in both mathematical and statistical settings.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the importance of considering bilingual learners'
   non-linguistic forms of communication for understanding their
   mathematical thinking. In particular, I provide a detailed analysis of
   communication involving a pair of high school bilingual learners during
   an exploratory activity where a touchscreen-based dynamic geometry
   environment (DGE) was used. The paper focuses on the word-use, gestures
   and dragging actions in student-pair communication about calculus
   concepts as they interacted with a touchscreen-based DGE. Findings
   suggest that the students relied on gestures and dragging as
   non-linguistic features of the mathematical discourse to communicate
   dynamic aspects of calculus. Moreover, by examining the interplay
   between language, gestures, dragging and diagrams, it was possible to
   identify bilingual learners' competence in mathematical communications.
   This paper raises questions about new forms of communication mobilised
   in dynamic, touchscreen environments, particularly for bilingual
   learners.},

Abstract = {A common theme in accounts of choosing mathematics is that of
   persistence in the face of troubles or difficulties which are often
   associated with the structuring effects of gender, class, culture and
   ethnicity. Centring on an analysis of one woman's account of becoming a
   mathematician, we build on our understanding of multiple and developing
   identities with the aim of capturing the nature of individual challenge
   to structuring discourses and its implications for choice and
   participation in mathematics more generally. Inspecting how she talks
   about events in the past, present, and future, we expand on Leont'ev's
   (1978, 1981) notion of leading activity to explore how we organise and
   prioritise activities (and their related identities) within the context
   of Holland et al.'s (1998) theory of identity in practice, hybridity and
   world-making. We interrogate the part played by contradiction in
   creating a space for individual agency through its resolution in hybrid
   practices and its relation to social change, exploring how our informant
   narrates taking up mathematics ``against the odds{''} as part of an
   ongoing process of ``re-writing{''} herself into new imagined worlds. In
   providing an insight into how one individual envisages and enacts a
   different mathematics culture in which she can have a place, our
   analysis suggests ways forward in creating new, more inclusive,
   mathematics education.},

Abstract = {This study is part of a wider research program, which seeks to
   investigate the existence (or not) of relationships between
   sociomathematical and mathematical norms at different academic levels.
   Here, we consider the norms that arise in the interaction between
   primary student teachers when they solve a mathematical task related to
   the mathematical definition. We hypothesize that in the colloquial
   mathematical discourse between these students coexist two types of
   discourse as follows: sociomathematical and mathematical, each one with
   its specific norms. This coexistence can originate commognitive
   conflicts. We have been able to identify different commognitive
   conflicts that arose from the simultaneous existence of
   sociomathematical norms and mathematical norms linked to defining,
   approaching their generation.},

Abstract = {First results of the project ``Mathematical Creativity of Children at
   Risk{''} (MaKreKi) will be presented. The project is conducted in the
   interdisciplinary research center ``Individual Development and Adaptive
   Education of Children at Risk{''} (IDeA {[}http://www.idea-frankfurt.eu;
   accessed 7 June 2013]). Combining a socio-constructivist approach of
   mathematics education with a psychoanalytic theory of attachment, two
   foci of analysis are examined: the interactional reconstruction of
   working processes of creative children while they are confronted with
   mathematical problems in a cooperative learning situation and a
   psychoanalytically oriented reconstruction of the psychodynamic
   background of a mathematically creative child in its family. In this
   article, one case study is presented. Theoretical considerations that
   combine the psychoanalytic findings with the results of the
   socio-constructivist analyses are presented. This combination offers an
   innovative and unique perspective on the mathematical creativity of
   young children in preschool, kindergarten and primary school age.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with one aspect of the endeavor to generate a theory of
   the development of mathematical thinking of children in the early years
   ages 3 to 10. By comparing two scenes, one from preschool and one from a
   first grade mathematics class, the relationship between diagrammatic and
   narrative argumentations among children and teachers is reconstructed
   and related to possible developmental trajectories of mathematical
   thinking. Theoretically, I attempt to implement these developmental
   paths in a concept of an ``Interactional Niche in the Development of

Abstract = {In the literature, problem-posing abilities are reported to be an
   important aspect/indicator of creativity in mathematics. The importance
   of problem-posing activities in mathematics is emphasized in educational
   documents in many countries, including the USA and China. This study was
   aimed at exploring high school students' creativity in mathematics by
   analyzing their problem-posing abilities in geometric scenarios. The
   participants in this study were from one location in the USA and two
   locations in China. All participants were enrolled in advanced
   mathematical courses in the local high school. Differences in the
   problems posed by the three groups are discussed in terms of quality
   (novelty/elaboration) as well as quantity (fluency). The analysis of the
   data indicated that even mathematically advanced high school students
   had trouble posing good quality and/or novel mathematical problems. We
   discuss our findings in terms of the culture and curricula of the
   respective school systems and suggest implications for future directions
   in problem-posing research within mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Inequalities are one of the foundational subjects in high school math
   curricula, but there is a lack of academic research into how students
   learn certain types of inequalities. This article fills part of the
   research gap by presenting the findings of a study that examined high
   school students' methods of approaching absolute value inequalities,
   their common mistakes, misconceptions, and the possible sources of these
   mistakes and misconceptions. The research study used two tools-a
   questionnaire and personal interviews. The questionnaire was given to
   481 students in the 10th and 11th grades in Israel who studied
   mathematics at intermediate and advanced levels. It was administered
   after the students had studied inequalities. Thirty-two students were
   interviewed in order to find their ways of thinking and the sources of
   their errors. The main types of mistakes that students consistently made
   when solving absolute value inequalities were found. Based on the
   study's findings, teachers can understand students' thought processes
   and use this understanding to conduct remediation and enhance
   mathematics instruction.},

Title = {Developing ``deliberate analysis{''} for learning mathematics and for

Abstract = {We illustrate and exemplify how the idea of reflection is framed by the
   enactive concept of ``deliberate analysis{''}. In keeping with this
   frame, we do not attempt to define reflection but rather work on the
   question of ``how do we do reflecting?{''} within such a frame. We set
   out our enactivist theoretical stance, in particular pointing to
   implications for how we can learn from experience and showing the role
   of ``deliberate analysis{''}. We then describe, drawing on education
   literature, what is generally seen as the purpose of reflection and
   review some existing conceptualizations in mathematics education,
   pointing out where we draw distinctions. To illustrate how we do
   reflecting, we offer excerpts from two lessons of an expert teacher and
   the writing of a prospective teacher. We exemplify how reflecting as
   deliberate analysis leads to a way of working with teachers supporting
   them in handling multiple views and ambiguity, their actions being
   contingent upon their students' actions in learning mathematics.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present an analytic framework for investigating expert
   mathematical learning as the process of building a network of
   mathematical resources by establishing relationships between different
   components and properties of mathematical ideas. We then use this
   framework to analyze the reasoning of ten mathematicians and mathematics
   graduate students that were asked to read and make sense of an
   unfamiliar, but accessible, mathematical proof in the domain of
   geometric topology. We find that experts are more likely to refer to
   definitions when questioning or explaining some aspect of the focal
   mathematical idea and more likely to refer to specific examples or
   instantiations when making sense of an unknown aspect of that idea.
   However, in general, they employ a variety of types of mathematical
   resources simultaneously. Often, these combinations are used to
   deconstruct the mathematical idea in order to isolate, identify, and
   explore its subcomponents. Some common patterns in the ways experts
   combined these resources are presented, and we consider implications for
   education.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a typology of forms and uses of abduction that can be
   exploited to better analyze abduction in proving processes. Based on the
   work of Peirce and Eco, we describe different kinds of abductions that
   occur in students' mathematical activity and extend Toulmin's model of
   an argument as a methodological tool to describe students' reasoning and
   to classify the different kinds of abduction. We then use this tool to
   analyze case studies of students' abductions and to identify cognitive
   difficulties students encounter. We conclude that some types of
   abduction may present obstacles, both in the argumentation when the
   abduction occurs and later when the proof is constructed.},

Abstract = {We draw on two studies of mathematics departments in 11-18 comprehensive
   maintained schools in England to compare and contrast the insights
   provided by differing theoretical perspectives. In one study, activity
   theory was used to describe common features of the work of three
   departments. In the other, a mathematics department was viewed and
   analysed as a complex system. In both cases, it was the learning of the
   departments as systems rather than of individuals that was of interest.
   The affordances and limitations of the analytical perspectives are
   discussed. Taken as a whole, this paper opens up the workings of school
   mathematics departments in a country which has a strong department
   culture.},

Title = {Proposing and testing a model relating students' graph selection and
   graph reasoning for dynamic situations},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 15},
Abstract = {Using a mixed methods approach, we explore a relationship between
   students' graph reasoning and graph selection via a fully online
   assessment. Our population includes 673 students enrolled in college
   algebra, an introductory undergraduate mathematics course, across four
   U.S. postsecondary institutions. The assessment is accessible on
   computers, tablets, and mobile phones. There are six items; for each,
   students are to view a video animation of a dynamic situation (e.g., a
   toy car moving along a square track), declare their understanding of the
   situation, select a Cartesian graph to represent a relationship between
   given attributes in the situation, and enter text to explain their graph
   choice. To theorize students' graph reasoning, we draw on Thompson's
   theory of quantitative reasoning, which explains students' conceptions
   of attributes as being possible to measure. To code students' written
   responses, we appeal to Johnson and colleagues' graph reasoning
   framework, which distinguishes students' quantitative reasoning about
   one or more attributes capable of varying (Covariation, Variation) from
   students' reasoning about observable elements in a situation (Motion,
   Iconic). Quantitizing those qualitative codes, we examine connections
   between the latent variables of students' graph reasoning and graph
   selection. Using structural equation modeling, we report a significant
   finding: Students' graph reasoning explains 40\% of the variance in
   their graph selection (standardized regression weight is 0.64, p <
   0.001). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that students' quantitative
   forms of graph reasoning (i.e., variational and covariational reasoning)
   influence the accuracy of their graph selection.},

Abstract = {The absence of discussions of identity that consider both
   subjective/personal and social aspects of identity is an important
   concern in mathematics education research. This paper proposes a
   framework to analyse the mathematical identities offered to and
   constructed by learners during peer interactions, by considering
   personal and social identities. To exemplify the framework, we discuss
   how two pairs of secondary school learners, who were engaged with
   similarly by their teachers and who performed similarly academically,
   interacted with each other and offered and constructed micro-identities
   during moments of a lesson, and macro-identities across lessons. We show
   that when learners were offered identities by a peer as higher, lower or
   equal status, they constructed their identities by affiliating with or
   resisting the identities offered by their peer. Their interactions and
   the identities that they constructed were informed by their personal
   identities, including their emotions when learning mathematics, and
   their social identities, including their choices to occupy certain roles
   in the classroom community.},

Abstract = {Over the last three decades, educational researchers and policymakers
   have increasingly promoted instructional strategies that centralize
   group work in mathematics. One difficulty teachers face in implementing
   group-based instruction in mathematics involves facilitating meaningful
   group interaction amongst students. In this paper, we explore student
   noticing as a novel strategy for supporting college students to
   collaborate effectively during group work in mathematics. First, we
   construct a noticing framework named student noticing of collaborative
   practices which provides a lens for ``seeing{''} how students notice
   their collaborative practices. Then, we use the framework to explore how
   25 college students noticed their collaborative practices in
   mathematics. After working on a novel mathematics task in groups, the
   college students listened to audiorecordings of their group interactions
   and responded to reflection questions about the effectiveness of their
   collaboration. We identified themes regarding how and what students
   noticed related to their collaborative practices. The findings reveal
   that students attended to many aspects of their collaboration, including
   their talking turns and propensity to listen to others. Students
   demonstrated a desire to change their collaborative practices in the
   future. The findings imply that teachers and researchers might leverage
   student noticing as a tool for improvement in mathematics group-based
   classrooms.},

Abstract = {Mathematics education is like many scientific disciplines witnessing an
   increase in scientific output. Examining and reviewing every paper in an
   area in detail are time-consuming, making comprehensive reviews a
   challenging task. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms like topic
   models have become increasingly popular in recent years. Their ability
   to summarize large amounts of unstructured text into coherent themes or
   topics allows researchers in any field to keep an overview of state of
   the art by creating automated literature reviews. In this article, we
   apply topic modeling in the context of mathematics education and
   showcase the use of this data science approach for creating literature
   reviews by training a model of all papers (n = 336) that have been
   presented in Thematic Working Groups related to technology in the first
   eleven Congresses of the European Society for Research in Mathematics
   Education (CERME). We guide the reader through the stepwise process of
   training a model and give recommendations for best practices and
   decisions that are decisive for the success of such an approach to a
   literature review. We find that research in this period revolved around
   25 distinct topics that can be grouped into four clusters: digital
   tools, teachers and their resources, technology experimentation, and a
   diverse cluster with a strong focus on student activity. Finally, a
   temporal analysis of these topics reveals a correlation between
   technology trends and research focus, allowing for reflection on future
   research in the field.},

Abstract = {Mathematical modelling is endorsed as both a means and an end to
   learning mathematics. Despite its utility and inclusion as a curricular
   objective, one of many questions remaining about learners' modelling
   regards how modelers choose relevant situational attributes and express
   mathematical relationships in terms of them. Research on quantitative
   reasoning has informed the field on how individuals quantify attributes
   and conceive of covariational relationships among them. However, this
   research has not often attended to modelers' mathematization in open
   modelling tasks, an endeavor that invites further attention to
   theoretical and methodological details. To this end, we offer a
   synthesis of existing theories to present a cognitive account of
   mathematical model construction through a quantity-oriented lens.
   Second, we use empirical data to illustrate why it is productive for
   theories of modelling to attend to and account for students'
   quantitative reasoning while modelling. Finally, we identify remaining
   challenges to coordinating different theoretical accounts of model
   construction.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {Isomorphism and homomorphism are topics central to abstract algebra, but
   research on mathematicians' views of these topics, especially with
   respect to sameness, remains limited. This study examines open response
   survey data from 197 mathematicians on how sameness could be helpful or
   harmful when studying isomorphism and homomorphism. Using thematic
   analysis, we examined whether sameness was viewed as helpful or harmful
   for isomorphism and homomorphism before examining rationales for those
   views. Making use of values of the mathematical community, we note that
   mathematicians saw conceptual and pedagogical benefits to connecting
   isomorphism and sameness, which connects to leveraging intuition and
   valuing ways of increasing understanding. Mathematicians' concerns
   around using sameness largely revolved around the violation of the
   mathematical community's idealized value of expressing a priori truth
   via a-contextual justifications. However, these concerns can be
   addressed through only targeted usage of sameness and explicit
   discussions around the utility and relevance of sameness. Implications
   include the importance of considering how interventions proposed by
   mathematics educators align with or provoke tension between values held
   by the mathematical community in order to mitigate or lean into those
   tensions and encourage fruitful dialogue between the mathematics and
   mathematics education communities.},

Abstract = {Data visualizations have proliferated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic
   to communicate information about the crisis and influence policy
   development and individual decision-making. In invoking exponential
   growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like,
   these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching
   and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from
   specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often
   consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and
   mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective,
   reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands
   unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have
   been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from
   particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading
   of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that
   draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets
   quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and
   through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories
   the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This
   approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of
   reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We
   illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data
   visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19.
   We offer a set of possible questions to guide a critical reading of data
   visualizations, beyond this set of examples.},

Abstract = {Mathematics discussions are important for helping students to develop
   conceptual understanding and to learn disciplinary norms and practices.
   In recent years, there has been increased attention to teaching
   prospective teachers to lead discussions with students. This paper
   examines the possibilities of designing a formative assessment that
   gathers information about prospective elementary teachers' skills with
   leading problem-based mathematics discussions and makes sense of such
   information. A decomposition of the practice of leading discussions was
   developed and used to design the assessment. Nine first-year teachers
   who graduated from a range of different teacher education programs
   participated in the study. The findings reveal that our formative
   assessment works to gather information about teachers' capabilities with
   leading discussions and that the associated tools support making sense
   of the information gathered. This suggests that such tools could be
   useful to support the formative assessment of the developing
   capabilities of prospective teachers.},

Title = {Creativity in students' modelling competencies: conceptualisation and

Abstract = {Modelling competencies are currently included in numerous curricula
   worldwide and are generally accepted as a complex, process-oriented
   construct. Therefore, effective measurement should include multiple
   dimensions, like the sub-competencies required throughout the modelling
   process. Departing from the characteristics of modelling problems as
   open and often underdetermined real-world problems, we propose to enrich
   the current conceptualisation of mathematical modelling competencies by
   including creativity, which plays an important role in numerous phases
   of the mathematical modelling process but has scarcely been considered
   in modelling discourse. In the study described in this paper, a new
   instrument for the evaluation of this enriched construct has been
   developed and implemented. The modelling competencies incorporating
   creativity of the students were evaluated based on the adequacy of the
   models and the modelling processes proposed, and the appropriateness and
   completeness of the approaches were evaluated in detail. Adapting
   measurement approaches for creativity that have been developed in the
   problem-solving discourse, certain criteria of creativity were selected
   to evaluate the creativity of the students' approaches in tackling
   modelling problems-namely, usefulness, fluency, and originality. The
   empirical study was conducted among 107 Chinese students at the upper
   secondary school level, who attended a modelling camp and independently
   solved three complex modelling problems. The results reveal significant
   correlations between fluency and originality in students' performances
   across all tasks; however, the relationships between usefulness and the
   other two creativity aspects were not consistent. Overall, the results
   of the study support the importance of the inclusion of creativity in
   the construct of modelling competencies.},

Abstract = {We investigate how students make sense of irrational exponents. The data
   comprise 32 interviews with university students, which revolved around a
   task designed to examine students' sensemaking processes involved in
   predicting and subsequently interpreting the shape of the graph of f(x)
   = x(root 2). The task design and data analysis relied on the concept of
   sensemaking trajectories, blending the notions of sensemaking and
   (hypothetical/actual) learning trajectories. The findings present four
   typical sensemaking trajectories the participants went through while
   coping with the notion of an irrational exponent, alongside associated
   reasoning themes that seemed to have guided these trajectories. In
   addition to irrational exponents, the analysis revealed the
   participants' reasoning and sensemaking of related mathematical ideas,
   such as rational exponents, approximations of irrational numbers by
   rational numbers, even/odd functions and numbers, and the meaning of
   exponentiation in general. The findings provide a step towards a better
   understanding of students' conceptual development of irrational
   exponents, which could in turn be used for the refinement of tasks aimed
   at promoting students' comprehension of the topic.},

Abstract = {This study explored what was entailed in implementing a professional
   development (PD) designed in the United States (US) to a different,
   Israeli, context. To achieve this goal, the first step was empirically
   examining the effectiveness of such a PD using quantitative methods. We
   then examined which adaptations were made in the imported PD and at what
   level. Our study is based on data obtained from the Israeli TEAMS
   (Teaching Exploratively for All Mathematics Students) PD, which
   ``imported{''} a US-based program based on ``The Five Practices for
   Orchestrating Productive Discussions{''} and ``Accountable Talk.{''} We
   build on studies of cultural adaptations of interventions which provide
   a framework whereby adaptations to a model can be made along three
   levels: philosophical, propositional, and procedural. To assess the
   effectiveness of the PD, we analyzed 211 recorded lessons. Individual
   growth curve analysis indicated significant growth in five parameters:
   intellectual authority, classroom discourse, exposure of student
   thinking, task enactment, and consolidation. These findings show that
   the PD was effective in importing several core practices which were
   relatively well defined. We use these quantitative findings, coupled
   with additional data obtained from the planning and execution of the PD,
   as a case to study the process of adapting an educational intervention
   to a new context. This analysis shows that our adaptations were mostly
   done at the procedural level. However, the quantitative results point to
   the possible necessity of also changing the propositional model of what
   intervention can work in a new context.},

Abstract = {In our exploration of the order of operations we focus on the following
   claim: ``In the conventional order of operations, division should be
   performed before multiplication.{''} This initially surprising claim is
   based on the acronym BEDMAS, a popular mnemonic used in Canada to assist
   students in remembering the order of operations. The claim was voiced by
   a teacher and then presented for consideration to a class of prospective
   elementary school teachers. We investigate the participants'
   understanding of the order of operations, focusing on the operations of
   multiplication and division. We report on participants' ways of
   resolving a cognitive conflict faced as a result of relying on memorized
   mnemonics.},

Abstract = {This paper is a commentary on the classroom interventions on the
   teaching and learning of proof reported in the seven empirical papers in
   this special issue. The seven papers show potential to enhance student
   learning in an area of mathematics that is not only notoriously
   difficult for students to learn and for teachers to teach, but also
   critically important to knowing and doing mathematics. Although the
   seven papers, and the intervention studies they report, vary in many
   ways-student population, content domain, goals and duration of the
   intervention, and theoretical perspectives, to name a few-they all
   provide valuable insight into ways in which classroom experiences might
   be designed to positively influence students' learning to prove. In our
   commentary, we highlight the contributions and promise of the
   interventions in terms of whether and how they present capacity to
   change the classroom culture, the curriculum, or instruction. In doing
   so, we distinguish between works that aim to enhance students'
   preparedness for, and competence in, proof and proving and works that
   explicitly foster appreciation for the need and importance of proof and
   proving. Finally, we also discuss briefly the interventions along three
   dimensions: how amenable to scaling up, how practicable for curricular
   integration, and how capable of producing long-lasting effects these
   interventions are.},

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that children in elementary grades have some
   facility with variable and variable notation in ways that warrant closer
   attention. We report here on an empirically developed progression in
   first-grade children's thinking about these concepts in functional
   relationships. Using learning trajectories research as a framework for
   the study, we developed and implemented an instructional sequence
   designed to foster children's understanding of functional relationships.
   Findings suggest that young children can learn to think in sophisticated
   ways about variable quantities and variable notation. This challenges
   assumptions that young children are not ``ready{''} for a study of such
   concepts and raises the question of whether difficulties adolescents
   exhibit might be ameliorated by an earlier introduction to these ideas.},

Abstract = {Secondary-tertiary transition issues are explored from the perspective
   of ways of doing mathematics that are constituted in the implicit
   aspects of teachers' action. Theories of culture (Hall, 1959) and
   ethnomethodology (Garfinkel, 1967) provide us with a basis for
   describing and explicating the ways of doing mathematics specific to
   each teaching level, according to the ``accounts{''} provided by the
   teachers involved in this research project. To borrow from Hall (1959),
   the ``informal{''} mode of mathematical culture specific to each
   teaching level plays a key role in attempts to better grasp transition
   issues.},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {This paper describes five growth points in linking representations of
   function developed from a study of secondary school learners. Framed
   within the cognitivist perspective and process-object conception of
   function, the growth points were identified and described based on
   linear and quadratic function tasks learners can do and their strategies
   and approaches on these tasks. A cross-sectional study was then made to
   investigate for a typical trajectory of the growth points. The tasks
   were fielded to 444 Year 8, 9, and 10 students, first at the start of
   the school year and then 5 months later. The framework of growth points,
   and their resonance with similar research elsewhere, offer a
   research-based framework that can serve as an analytic tool for
   describing understanding, assessing learning and for pedagogy.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to enhance our understanding of how
   students listen and attend to multiple solutions proposed by their
   classmates during the activity of comparison. This study examines ten
   consecutive lessons in each of the two eighth-grade classrooms in Tokyo
   that are organized in the style of structured problem solving.
   Twenty-four students were asked to be video/audio recorded during the
   lessons and also to identify and comment on their significant classroom
   events in the post-lesson video-stimulated interviews. The students'
   comments on the situations of comparing multiple solutions were
   classified into five codes, which show that they listened to multiple
   solutions differently on the basis of their process and product in the
   preceding individual problem solving. Furthermore, it was found that the
   students' exploratory questions led them to active listening to other
   people, which contributed to their meaning-making activity.},

Abstract = {Statistical reasoning focuses on properties that belong not to
   individual data values but to the entire aggregate. We analyze students'
   statements from three different sources to explore possible building
   blocks of the idea of data as aggregate and speculate on how young
   students go about putting these ideas together. We identify four general
   perspectives that students use in working with data, which in addition
   to an aggregate perspective include regarding data as pointers, as case
   values, and as classifiers. Some students seem inclined to view data
   from only one of these three alternative perspectives, which then
   influences the types of questions they ask, the data representations
   they generate or prefer, the interpretations they give to notions such
   as the average, and the conclusions they draw from the data.},

Abstract = {Mathematics continues to be an enabling discipline for Science,
   Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)-based university studies
   and related careers. Explanatory models for females' underrepresentation
   in higher level mathematics and STEM-based courses comprise
   learner-related and environmental variables-including societal beliefs.
   Using Facebook to recruit participants, we explored if mathematics,
   science, and computing continue to be viewed as male domains. Responses
   were received from 784 people in 81 countries. As well as looking at the
   views of the world at large, responses from nine countries with at least
   30 respondents-Canada, China, Egypt, India, Israel, Singapore, UAE, UK,
   and Australia-were examined in more detail. The results indicated that
   among those who held gender-stereotyped views (and many did not),
   mathematics, science, and computing were considered more suitable for
   males than for females.},

Abstract = {This study assessed if students with and without disabilities used
   calculators (fourfunction, scientific, or graphing) to solve mathematics
   assessment problems and whether using calculators improved their
   performance. Participants were sixth and seventh-grade students educated
   with either National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded or traditional
   mathematics curriculum materials. Students solved multiple choice and
   open-ended problems based on items from the State's released previous
   assessments. A linear mixed model was conducted for each grade to
   analyze the factors impacting students' self-reported calculator use.
   Chi Square tests were also performed on both grade's data to determine
   the relationship between using a calculator and correctly solving
   problems. Results suggested only time as a main factor impacting
   calculator use and students who self-reported using a calculator were
   more likely to answer questions correctly. The results have implications
   for practice given the controversy over calculator use by students both
   with and without disabilities.},

Abstract = {Analyzing and designing productive group work and effective
   communication constitute ongoing research interests in mathematics
   education. In this article we contribute to this research by using and
   developing a newly introduced analytical approach for examining
   effective communication within group work in mathematics education. By
   using data from 12 to 13-year old students playing a dice game as well
   as from a group of university students working with a proof by
   induction, the article shows how the link between visual mediators and
   technical terms is crucial in students' attempts to communicate
   effectively. The critical evaluation of visual mediators and technical
   terms, and of links between them, is useful for researchers interested
   in analyzing effective communication and designing environments
   providing opportunities for students to learn mathematics.},

   Valsiner's zone theory, in a classroom setting, views students' freedom
   of choice of action and thought as mediated by the teacher. The
   extension of this theory adds that teachers' freedom of choice of action
   and thought is mediated by `significant others' and also by the actions
   of students with new freedoms. The paper presents necessary theoretical
   constructs and provides extracts from lessons and from teacher-teacher
   collaboration to illustrate the theoretical extension.},

Abstract = {Researchers have speculated that children find it more difficult to
   acquire conceptual understanding of the inverse relation between
   multiplication and division than that between addition and subtraction.
   We reviewed research on children and adults' use of shortcut procedures
   that make use of the inverse relation on two kinds of problems:
   inversion problems (e.g., 9 x 24 divided by 24) and associativity
   problems (e.g., 9 x 24 divided by 8). Both can be solved more easily if
   the division of the second and third numbers is performed before the
   multiplication of the first and second numbers. The findings we reviewed
   suggest that understanding and use of the inverse relation between
   multiplication and division develops relatively slowly and is difficult
   for both children and adults to implement in shortcut procedures if they
   are not flexible problem solvers. We use the findings to expand an
   existing model, highlight some similarities and differences in solvers'
   use of conceptual knowledge across operations, and discuss educational
   implications of the findings.},

Abstract = {Textbooks play an important part in the design of instruction. This
   study analyzed the presentation of fractions in textbooks designed for
   the elementary grades in Kuwait, Japan, and the USA. The analysis
   focused on the physical characteristics of the books, the structure of
   the lessons, and the nature of the mathematical problems presented.
   Findings showed USA and Kuwaiti mathematics textbooks are larger than
   Japanese textbooks; this larger size is consistent with a great deal of
   repetition. The Japanese texts do not address fractions until the third
   grade; they use linear models and connect fractions with measurement. In
   the USA and Kuwait, fractions are introduced in the first grade. The
   Harcourt text uses concrete material to help students learn fraction
   procedures. For the Kuwaiti series, the lessons depend on using some
   pictorial representation of the area model to illustrate fraction ideas.
   All these textbooks focus on standard algorithms as the main
   computational methods.},

Title = {Conceptualizing sound as a form of incarnate mathematical consciousness},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {79},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Much of the evidence provided in support of the argument that
   mathematical knowing is embodied/enacted is based on the analysis of
   gestures and bodily configurations, and, to a lesser extent, on certain
   vocal features (e.g., prosody). However, there are dimensions involved
   in the emergence of mathematical knowing and the production of
   mathematical communication that have not yet been investigated. The
   purpose of this article is to theorize one of these dimensions, which we
   call incarnate sonorous consciousness. Drawing on microanalyses of two
   exemplary episodes in which a group of third graders are sorting
   geometric solids, we show how sound has the potential to mark
   mathematical similarities and distinctions. These ``audible{''}
   similarities and distinctions, which may be produced by incarnate
   dimensions such as beat gestures and prosody, allow children to
   objectify certain geometrical properties of the objects with which they
   transact. Moreover, the analysis shows that sonorous production is
   intertwined with other dimensions of students' bodily activity. These
   findings are interpreted according to the ``theory of mathematics in the
   flesh,{''} an alternative to current embodiment/enactivist theories in
   mathematics education.},

Volume = {79},

Pages = {127-147},

Abstract = {There is broad acceptance that mathematics teachers' beliefs about the
   nature of mathematics influence the ways in which they teach the
   subject. It is also recognised that mathematics as practised in typical
   school classrooms is different from the mathematical activity of
   mathematicians. This paper presents case studies of two secondary
   mathematics teachers, one experienced and the other relatively new to
   teaching, and considers their beliefs about the nature of mathematics,
   as a discipline and as a school subject. Possible origins and future
   developments of the structures of their belief systems are discussed
   along with implications of such structures for their practice. It is
   suggested that beliefs about mathematics can usefully be considered in
   terms of a matrix that accommodates the possibility of differing views
   of school mathematics and the discipline.},

Abstract = {Following Husserl's speculations on how geometry originated, we suggest
   that spatial perception is seduced by language as a result of human
   attempts to capture, signify and share its concepts. And this language
   traps geometry and humans themselves in to the forms that have guided
   and regulated past practices, thereby obscuring possibilities for
   cultural growth and adjustments to new conditions. Some body movement
   exercises reveal student teachers' spatial orientations. The paper
   proposes that the very evolution of geometry, and the ontological status
   of its objects, relate to their representation in cultural forms
   referenced to human self-image. It is further argued that learning
   crucially relates to evolving mathematical or pedagogical understandings
   of spatial phenomena.},

Abstract = {Free, open, online, calculus forums are websites where students from
   around the world can post course-related queries that may be viewed and
   responded to by anonymous others. These sites are an emergent resource
   for students seeking help and have become a part of many students'
   mathematical experience. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and
   describe the forums to the research community as a computer-mediated
   form of help seeking, and to briefly characterize the forms of student
   activity in one popular calculus help forum. Two hundred exchanges on
   limit and related rates were collected and examined for evidence that
   students are contributing ideas and proposals for action when they
   initiate the exchange and following intervention. The findings justify
   the need for further research since students are using the forums in a
   variety of ways and sometimes participate meaningfully. The forums have
   potential for testing student responses to pedagogical approaches.},

Title = {Lexical bundle analysis in mathematics classroom discourse: the
   significance of stance},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-42},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this article, we introduce the lexical bundle, defined by corpus
   linguists as a group of three or more words that frequently recur
   together, in a single group, in a particular register (Biber, Johansson,
   Leech, Conrad, \& Finegan, 2006; Cortes, English for Specific Purposes
   23: 397-423, 2004). Attention to lexical bundles helps to explore
   hegemonic practices in mathematics classrooms because lexical bundles
   play an important role in structuring discourse and are often treated as
   ``common sense{''} ways of interacting. We narrow our findings and
   discussion to a particular type of lexical bundle (called a ``stance
   bundle{''} or bundles that relate to feelings, attitudes, value
   judgments, or assessments) because it was the most significant type
   found. Through comparing our corpus from secondary mathematics
   classrooms with two other corpora (one from university classrooms (not
   including mathematics classrooms) and one from conversations), we show
   that most of the stance bundles were particular to secondary mathematics
   classrooms. The stance bundles are interpreted through the lens of
   interpersonal positioning, drawing on ideas from systemic functional
   linguistics. We conclude by suggesting additional research that might be
   done, discussing limitations of this work, and pointing out that the
   findings warrant further attention to interpersonal positioning in
   mathematics classrooms.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at analysing traditionally taught children's
   acquisition and use of shortcut strategies in the number domain 20-100.
   One-hundred-ninety-five second, third, and fourth graders of different
   mathematical achievement levels participated in the study. They were
   administered two tasks, both consisting of a series of two-digit
   additions and subtractions that maximally elicit the use of the
   compensation (45 + 29 = \_; 45 + 30 - 1 = 75 - 1 = 74) and indirect
   addition strategy (71 - 68 = \_; 68 + 2 = 70, 70 + 1 = 71, so the answer
   is 2+1 or 3). In the first task, children were instructed to solve all
   items as accurately and as fast as possible with their preferred
   strategy. The second task was to generate at least two different
   strategies for each item. Results demonstrated that children of all
   grades and all achievement levels hardly applied the compensation and
   indirect addition strategy in the first task. Children's strategy
   reports in the second task revealed that younger and lower achieving
   children did not apply these strategies because they did not (yet)
   discover these strategies. By contrast, older and higher achieving
   children appeared to have acquired these strategies by themselves.
   Results are interpreted in relation to cognitive psychological and
   socio-cultural perspectives on children's mathematics learning.},

Title = {Social (justice) mathematics: racializing effects of ordering pedagogies
   and their inherited regimes of truth},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 25},
Abstract = {This article examines how making mathematics responsive to perceived
   differences in students' real-life needs historically produced
   racializing distinctions in school mathematics. Decentering social
   actors and their intentions, we analyze pedagogical techniques in social
   mathematics courses (1930s-1940s) and social justice mathematics
   education studies oriented to health and civic participation (1990s-).
   Despite shifts in ethico-political principles-from enlightening to
   empowering-racializing effects of these pedagogies persist by projecting
   relative distances between populations and cultural norms of proper
   living and well-ordered public life. Juxtaposing past and present, we
   highlight dangers in how pedagogical interventions to improve malleable
   differences in children and communities also racialize target groups as
   yet-to-develop the evidence-based reasoning or mathematical
   consciousness deemed necessary to attain what are imputed as healthy
   private and public life. We offer ordering pedagogies as an analytical
   tool to interrogate practices of racialization and to account for
   inherited regimes of truth operating in mathematics education by
   scrutinizing how pedagogical practices produce difference-dividing and
   ordering students along a hierarchy of perceived needs.},

Title = {Shame, entitlement, and the systemic racism of mathematics ``ability{''}
   grouping in Aotearoa New Zealand},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {Decades of research has documented the consequences of allocating school
   students into a hierarchy of classes with narrow ranges of mathematics
   attainment, a process known as streaming, tracking, setting, or
   ``ability{''} grouping. The purported benefits of streaming are
   inconsistent and disputed, but the harms are clear, in particular, (1)
   the limiting curriculum often available in low streams and (2) the loss
   of self-confidence that results from being positioned in a low stream.
   Building on this foundation, we discuss streaming in mathematics as tied
   to systemic racism in Aotearoa New Zealand, where the harmful effects of
   streaming fall most heavily on Maori and Pasifika students. Previous
   analyses of race and streaming have focused primarily on the racial
   composition of streamed classes, bias in stream allocation, and
   racialised teacher expectations in streamed settings. In contrast, we
   focus on the emotional consequences of streaming, arguing that streaming
   produces racialised emotions of shame and entitlement as unintended but
   predictable consequences. We illustrate the racialised production of
   entitlement and shame through collaborative storying, interweaving our
   own biographies with a re-analysis of student interviews from two prior
   studies.},

Abstract = {This study identifies language specific errors made with transcoding
   tasks to inform possible future pedagogic decisions regarding the
   language used when teaching early number. We compared children aged 5-7
   years from Kuwait and England. The spoken Arabic language of Kuwait gave
   the opportunity to compare not only languages where the tens and units
   digits are said in a different order, but also where the direction of
   writing is different. We asked 396 children from Kuwait and 256 children
   from England to write down 2-, and 3-digit numbers which were spoken to
   them. We found that the direction of the language did not affect the
   nature of errors made, but that other aspects of the two languages could
   account for some of the differences we found. As well as supporting
   previous studies regarding the significance of the order in which the
   tens and units are said, we found significance in the role the word and
   can play in marking the number of digits involved. We also noted that
   the way the numbers 20, 100 and 200 are said in Arabic can set up
   particular symbolic associations which could account for other
   differences we found. Having identified language-specific errors, we
   discuss possible pedagogic decisions to temporarily use more regular
   language for the number names in each of the languages and propose the
   order in which number names are taught might be different to their
   mathematical order of magnitude.},

Abstract = {There is a need for a more robust conceptualization of engagement in
   mathematics education research. Investigating how teachers describe
   engagement can provide insight into relationships between purposes of
   engagement and dimensions of engagement. In this exploratory study, we
   examined how 28 secondary mathematics teachers in two states in the USA
   talked about their students' engagement. During interviews, we asked
   teachers to provide their definitions for engagement, describe their
   teaching strategies for engaging students, and describe their
   observations of engagement during a video clip from their own classroom.
   We interpreted teachers' talk to identify how they described the nature
   of mathematics engagement (dimensions such as behavioral, cognitive,
   affective, and/or social engagement) and purposes of engagement
   (engagement in learning or in schooling {[}Harris, 2011]). When teachers
   described the purpose of engagement as engagement in learning, they also
   tended to describe the nature of engagement with cognitive and social
   dimensions and with multiple dimensions of engagement.},

Abstract = {Variance and invariance are two powerful mathematical ideas to support
   geometrical and spatial thinking, yet there is limited research about
   teachers' knowledge of variance and invariance. In this paper, we
   examined how high school teachers deal with the task of looking for
   invariant properties in a dynamic geometry environment (DGE) setting.
   Specifically, we investigated if they even attend to invariant
   properties; what invariant properties they discern and discuss; and how
   DGE can support such discernment. Our analysis found that teachers tend
   to discern and discuss invariant properties mainly when they were probed
   to consider invariance. We also found four categories of invariant
   properties that seem to be important for a robust and rich understanding
   of geometric objects in the context of invariance and DGE. The use of
   DGE allowed teachers to see and interact with invariant properties, thus
   suggesting that accessing geometry dynamically may have structural
   affordances especially when exploring invariance. Teachers were able to
   enact different DGE movements to discern and discuss invariant
   properties, as well as to reason with and about them. We also saw that
   teachers' backgrounds and past experiences can play an important role in
   their descriptions of invariant properties. Possible future research
   directions and implications to teacher education are discussed.},

Abstract = {The investigation at scale of the tensions that teachers need to manage
   when deciding to follow recommendations for practice has been hampered
   by the problem of occurrence: The conditions in which those decisions
   could be made need to occur during an observation in order for observers
   to document how teachers handle them. Simulations have been recommended
   as a way to immerse teachers in instructional contexts in which they
   have the opportunity to follow such recommendations and observe what
   teachers choose to do in response. In this article, we show an example
   of how a teaching simulation may be used to support such investigation,
   in the context of policy recommendations to open up classroom discussion
   and consider multiple solutions and in the instructional situation of
   doing proofs in geometry. A contrast between the decisions made by
   expert and novice teachers (n = 59) in the simulation, analyzed using
   multiple regression, adds empirical evidence to earlier conjectures
   based on qualitative analysis of classroom teaching experiments that
   revealed teachers to be particularly attentive to epistemological and
   temporal constraints. We found that expert and novice teachers differed
   in how likely they were to prefer practices recommended by policymakers.
   Specifically, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice
   teachers to open up classroom discussions when they had the knowledge
   resources to correct a student error. Similarly, expert teachers were
   significantly more likely than novice teachers to explore multiple
   solutions when there were no time constraints.},

Abstract = {Formulas are involved in most parts of the mathematical curriculum in
   upper secondary education and in everyday mathematics classrooms, but
   research shows that students have difficulties using formulas
   adequately. When students are presented with a task, the task activates
   a conceptual frame in the students, making them perceive formulas in a
   specific way, thereby affecting their mathematical behaviour. In this
   paper, building ideal types of patterns of mathematical behaviours is
   used to conceptualise `view on formula' specified by several specific
   views. The concept of `view on formula' is applied in an analysis of a
   classroom episode pointing to reasons for the difficulties students have
   with handling formulas. When views are either missing or not used in a
   flexible way this can lead to an unsuccessful handling of formulas.
   Also, students' views on formula may indicate what knowledge is missing
   for solving a task involving formulas. Taken together, this points to
   the importance of paying attention to views on formulas in the everyday
   mathematics classroom.},

Abstract = {Past studies have documented some pre-service teachers' (PSTs)
   difficulties in reasoning about sampling variability. This study adds to
   the body of literature by investigating the ideas that PSTs employ in
   reasoning about sampling variability, and by conjecturing what is behind
   the difficulties especially during the contextuality episodes. This
   issue was studied in the context of a content course on statistics and
   probability for elementary and middle grade PSTs at a Midwestern
   American university. An analysis of a PST's video and screen records of
   a task-based interview was guided by techniques of knowledge analysis
   (diSessa et al., 2016), and focused on two clear contextuality episodes
   that have caused disequilibrium in the PST's knowledge system. The
   analysis described at a moment-by-moment level the cognitive dynamics of
   the transitions that occurred in the PST's knowledge system and
   highlighted some of the difficulties that arise from the activation of
   less-productive knowledge elements over others. The significance of this
   study is in its use for the techniques of knowledge analysis from the
   field of cognitive science to provide a fine-grained description of
   PSTs' difficulties in reasoning about sampling variability that went
   beyond the traditional description of these difficulties as
   misconceptions.},

Abstract = {Prior work on teachers' mathematical knowledge has contributed to our
   understanding of the important role of teachers' knowledge in teaching
   and learning. However, one aspect of teachers' mathematical knowledge
   has received little attention: strategic competence for word problems.
   Adapting from one of the most comprehensive characterizations of
   mathematics learning (NRC, 2001), we argue that teachers' mathematical
   knowledge also includes strategic competence, which consists of devising
   a valid solution strategy, mathematizing the problem (i.e., choosing
   particular strategies and presentations to translate the word problem
   into mathematical expressions), and arriving at a correct answer
   (executing a solution) for a word problem. By examining the responses of
   350 fourth- and fifth-grade teachers in the USA to four multistep
   fraction word problems, we were able to explore manifestations of
   teachers' strategic competence for word problems. Findings indicate that
   teachers' strategic competence was closely related to whether they
   devised a valid strategy. Further, how teachers dealt with known and
   unknown quantities in their mathematization of word problems was an
   important indicator of their strategic competence. Teachers with strong
   strategic competence used algebraic notations or pictorial
   representations and dealt with unknown quantities more frequently in
   their solution methods than did teachers with weak strategic competence.
   The results of this study provide evidence for the critical nature of
   strategic competence as another dimension needed to understand and
   describe teachers' mathematical knowledge.},

Abstract = {Insight into early precursors of proportional reasoning is necessary to
   further our theoretical understanding of mathematical development and to
   guide early interventions. Although several researchers have suggested
   patterning as a possible precursor for proportional reasoning, there is
   little empirical evidence to support this assumption, particularly at a
   young age. To address this gap, the current study explored if patterning
   in 4- to 5-year-olds (n = 346) is associated with proportional reasoning
   one and a half years later. Two measures of patterning ability
   (repeating and growing patterns) and two measures of proportional
   reasoning (one with discrete quantities and one with a discrete and a
   continuous quantity) were administered, together with measures
   addressing general cognitive and numerical abilities. Regression
   analyses showed that patterning is a unique predictor of proportional
   reasoning ability over and above sex and general cognitive and numerical
   abilities. An interaction effect between pattern types and the nature of
   the quantities was observed: Performance on repeating patterns was
   uniquely related to performance on proportional reasoning with two
   discrete quantities, whereas performance on growing patterns was
   uniquely related to performance on proportional reasoning with a
   discrete and a continuous quantity. Theoretical implications and
   suggestions for future studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {Previous studies of in-service teachers indicate strong links between
   teacher self-efficacy and factors such as instructional quality and
   pupils' achievement. Yet, much of this research approaches self-efficacy
   from the perspective of teaching, and not of subject knowledge.
   Furthermore, the majority of such studies employ quantitative measures
   of self-efficacy. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 22
   experienced elementary teachers, this paper takes a different approach.
   The interviews, broadly focused on teachers' mathematics-related
   beliefs, brought to the surface four themes around which teachers
   construct their mathematics teacher self-efficacy. These concern
   participants' perspectives on their mathematics-related past
   experiences, mathematical competence, ability to realise their
   didactical visions and resilience in the face of challenging
   mathematical situations. These themes, which are discussed in relation
   to existing literature, not only confirm the complexity of self-efficacy
   but also highlight the need for greater attention to its
   conceptualisation and measurement.},

Abstract = {The Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory is applied to study
   student understanding of implicit differentiation in the context of
   functions of one variable. The APOS notions of Schema and schema
   development in terms of the intra-, inter-, and trans-triad are used to
   analyze semi-structured interviews with 25 students who had just
   finished taking a single-variable calculus course. Results suggest that
   the notions of chain rule and implicit function play a key role in the
   possibility of attaining implicit differentiation Schema coherence. For
   this, students need to construct at least a Process conception of
   implicit function and a chain rule Schema with coherence given by
   function composition. Students also need to construct relations between
   implicit function and each one of three components of the implicit
   differentiation Schema: explicit function, derivative, and
   differentiation rules. The study shows that students taking an
   introductory calculus course can be expected to have difficulty
   understanding the main ideas of implicit differentiation unless special
   activities are designed to help them make the necessary connections
   between components of the implicit differentiation Schema. The study
   suggests the need to further investigate the implementation of
   activities that foster the constructions proposed, in textbooks and
   classrooms.},

Abstract = {The use of artifacts to introduce the distributive law of multiplication
   over addition in primary school is a diffused approach: it is possible
   to find pre-constructed learning trajectories in instructional
   materials. However, it is still unclear how the teacher might support
   his/her students in transitioning from concrete to symbolic
   representations of the distributive law. In the theoretical frame of the
   Theory of Semiotic Mediation, we report on a study where Laisant's
   table, an artifact embodying the rectangular model of multiplication, is
   used to introduce distributive law in second grade. Taking a
   microanalytical approach, we show how a group of students connects the
   representation provided by the artifact with the symbolic representation
   of the arithmetic property (as equivalence of numerical sentences). Two
   different semiotic chains are identified and presented, showing the
   continuity between the activity with the artifact and the mathematical
   signs emerging in following activities and promoted by tasks
   specifically designed. The role of the teacher in triggering and
   scaffolding this process is highlighted.},

Abstract = {Assessment is a crucial factor in the implementation of curriculum
   reform. Little is known, however, on how curriculum changes can be
   reflected adequately in assessment, particularly if the reform concerns
   process skills. This issue was investigated for the case of assessing
   mathematical thinking in a mathematics curriculum reform for
   15-18-year-old students in the Netherlands. From 2011 until 2017, these
   reform curricula were field tested in pilot schools, while other schools
   used the regular curricula. The research question is how this reform was
   reflected in national examination papers and in student performance on
   corresponding assignments. To address this question, we developed a
   theory-based model for mathematical thinking, analyzed pilot and regular
   examination papers, and carried out a quantitative and qualitative
   analysis of students' work on assignments that invite mathematical
   thinking. The results were that the pilot examination papers did address
   mathematical thinking to a greater degree than the regular papers, but
   that there was a decrease over time. Pilot school students outperformed
   their peers in regular schools on assignments that invite mathematical
   thinking by 4-5\% on average and showed more diversity in
   problem-solving strategies. To explain the decreasing presence of
   mathematical thinking in examination papers, we conjecture that
   conservative forces within the assessment construction process may push
   back change.},

Abstract = {Theories for conceptualizing educational policies aimed at improving
   classroom instruction at scale are under development in the educational
   sciences. In using such theories, it is essential to note the specific
   educational context. In this article, we conceptualize the role of
   contextual factors when operationalizing Cobb and Jackson (2012)
   {[}Journal of the Learning Sciences] in the Swedish context. Drawing on
   data and results from a large-scale project carried out during 2012-2017
   and studies of Swedish educational contexts, we conceptualize contextual
   factors for large-scale projects. Besides rather obvious explicit
   contextual factors such as ongoing policies and practices, we elaborate
   on how the underlying, more implicit contextual factors of (1) the
   positioning of teachers within the educational system, (2) the
   positioning of teachers within the classroom, and (3) traditions of
   visible and invisible pedagogy affected the establishment of policy in
   the Swedish context. Insight into these factors deepens earlier
   frameworks of context, and helps not only to operationalize the policy
   within the context but also to make explicit hidden features of a
   cultural context that are important to influence if the aim of the
   educational policy is to reorganize school practices.},

Abstract = {This study furthers the theory of conceptual blending as a useful tool
   for revealing the structure and process of student reasoning in relation
   to the Sierpinski triangle (ST). We use conceptual blending to
   investigate students' reasoning, revealing how students engage with the
   ST and coordinate their understandings of its area and perimeter. Our
   analysis of ten individual interviews with mathematics education
   masters' student documents diverse ways in which students reason about
   this situation through the constituent processes of blending:
   composition, completion, and elaboration. This reveals that students who
   share basic understandings of the area and perimeter of the ST recruit
   idiosyncratic ideas to engage with and resolve the paradox of a figure
   with infinite perimeter and zero area.},

Title = {Developing mathematical fluency: comparing exercises and rich tasks},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {97},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Achieving fluency in important mathematical procedures is fundamental to
   students' mathematical development. The usual way to develop procedural
   fluency is to practise repetitive exercises, but is this the only
   effective way? This paper reports three quasi-experimental studies
   carried out in a total of 11 secondary schools involving altogether 528
   students aged 12-15. In each study, parallel classes were taught the
   same mathematical procedure before one class undertook traditional
   exercises while the other worked on a ``mathematical etude{''} (Foster
   International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and
   Technology, 44(5), 765-774, 2013b), designed to be a richer task
   involving extensive opportunities for practice of the relevant
   procedure. Bayesian t tests on the gain scores between pre- and
   post-tests in each study provided evidence of no difference between the
   two conditions. A Bayesian meta-analysis of the three studies gave a
   combined Bayes factor of 5.83, constituting ``substantial{''} evidence
   (Jeffreys, 1961) in favour of the null hypothesis that etudes and
   exercises were equally effective, relative to the alternative hypothesis
   that they were not. These data support the conclusion that the
   mathematical etudes trialled are comparable to traditional exercises in
   their effects on procedural fluency. This could make etudes a viable
   alternative to exercises, since they offer the possibility of richer,
   more creative problem-solving activity, with comparable effectiveness in
   developing procedural fluency.},

Abstract = {This paper describes kindergarten children's engagement with two
   patterning activities. The first activity includes two tasks in which
   children are asked to choose possible ways for extending two different
   repeating patterns and the second activity calls for comparing different
   pairs of repeating patterns. Children's recognition of the unit of
   repeat and their recognition of the structure of the repeating patterns
   are investigated. Findings suggest differences between children's
   responses to patterns that end with a complete unit of repeat and those
   that end with a partial unit. In addition, the issue of presenting
   repeating patterns using different media is discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate gender differences in
   students' mathematics achievement and in their attitudes toward
   mathematics. Another purpose was to examine mathematics teachers'
   beliefs and their perceptions of their male and female students'
   ability. The sample consisted of 692 students (353 girls, 339 boys)
   between the ages of 12 and 16 years, enrolled in grades 7-9 at four
   private schools in Lebanon. Data were collected using the Attitudes
   Toward Mathematics (ATM) scale (Aiken in Journal for Research in
   Mathematics Education, 5, 67-71, 1974), school records, and interviews
   with teachers. Results showed no significant gender differences in
   either achievement or attitudes toward mathematics, thus dispelling the
   common belief that female students in traditional cultures do not
   perform well in mathematics and dislike the field. A main effect for
   grade level was found with ninth graders significantly outperforming
   their younger counterparts. Also, teachers viewed mathematics as a male
   domain and attributed boys' success to ability and girls' success to
   effort. They also interacted with boys more frequently regardless of the
   nature of the exchange. Implications for future research and for
   instructional practice are overviewed.},

Abstract = {We discuss a teaching experiment that explored two pre-service secondary
   teachers' meanings for the unit circle. Our analyses suggest that the
   participants' initial unit circle meanings predominantly consisted of
   calculational strategies for relating a given circle to what they called
   ``the unit circle.{''} These strategies did not entail conceiving a
   circle's radius as a unit of measure. In response, we implemented tasks
   designed to focus the participants' attention on various measurement
   ideas including conceiving a circle's radius as a unit magnitude.
   Against the backdrop of the participants' actions on these tasks, we
   characterize shifts in the participants' unit circle meanings and we
   briefly describe how these shifts influenced their ability to use the
   unit circle in trigonometric situations.},

Title = {A critical discourse analysis of practical problems in a foundation

Abstract = {Mathematical problems that make links to the everyday and to disciplines
   other than mathematics-variously referred to as practical, realistic,
   real-world or applied problems in the literature-feature in school and
   undergraduate mathematics reforms aimed at increasing mathematics
   participation in contexts of inequity and diversity. In this article, we
   present a micro-and macro-analysis of a prototypical practical problem
   in an undergraduate mathematics course at a South African university.
   This course offers an alternative route to a mathematics major for
   students considered disadvantaged by enduring educational inequalities
   in South Africa. Using a socio-political practice perspective on
   mathematics and critical discourse analysis-drawn from Norman
   Fairclough's critical linguists-we describe what mathematics and
   mathematical identities practical problems make available to students
   and compare this to what is valued in school mathematics and other
   university mathematics courses. Our analysis shows that these practical
   problems draw in complex ways on sometimes contradictory practices in
   the wider context, requiring the student to work flexibly with the
   movement of meaning within and across texts. We raise for further
   consideration the possible consequences of this complexity and offer
   suggestions for practice that take into account issues of power.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the theoretical and methodological issues in
   exploring identity and agency within a narrative of choosing
   mathematics. Taking as our starting point Bakhtin's emphasis on the
   dialogic space between interlocutors, we explore how an awareness of the
   addressivity and otherness of utterances, and of the role of genre and
   heteroglossia in self-authoring, can be used in the analysis of an
   interview to gain insight into one student's narrative of choosing
   mathematics despite the fear that it held for her. We consider how our
   own research preoccupations with the role of gender and family
   discourses in learners' relationships with mathematics played a part in
   the interview, and how the interviewee's appropriation of, and
   resistance to, these and other genres can be understood as an assertion
   of agency within her particular narrative of choice.},

Abstract = {Based on the findings of an error analysis revealing that Indonesian
   ninth- and tenth-graders had difficulties in solving context-based
   tasks, we investigated the opportunity-to-learn offered by Indonesian
   textbooks for solving context-based mathematics tasks and the relation
   of this opportunity-to-learn to students' difficulties in solving these
   tasks. An analysis framework was developed to investigate the
   characteristics of tasks in textbooks from four perspectives: the type
   of context used in tasks, the purpose of context-based tasks, the type
   of information provided in tasks, and the type of cognitive demands of
   tasks. With this framework, three Indonesian mathematics textbooks were
   analyzed. Our analysis showed that only about 10 \% of the tasks in the
   textbooks are context-based tasks. Moreover, at least 85 \% of these
   tasks provide exactly the information needed to solve them and do not
   leave room for students to select relevant information by themselves.
   Furthermore, of the context-based tasks, 45 \% are reproduction tasks
   requiring performing routine mathematical procedures, 53 \% are
   connection tasks requiring linking different mathematical curriculum
   strands, and only 2 \% are reflection tasks, which are considered as
   tasks with the highest level of cognitive demand. A linkage between the
   findings of the error analysis and the textbook analysis suggests that
   the lacking opportunity-to-learn in Indonesian mathematics textbooks may
   cause Indonesian students' difficulties in solving context-based tasks.
   Based on the results of this study, recommendations are given for
   improving the opportunities-to-learn to solve context-based tasks as
   well as for doing further research on this topic.},

Abstract = {The symbolic manipulation capabilities of computer algebra systems,
   which we refer to as CAS-S, are now becoming instantiated within
   secondary mathematics textbooks in the United States for the first time.
   While a number of research studies have examined how teachers use this
   technology in their classrooms, one of the most important factors in how
   this technology is used in the classroom is how it is embedded within
   curricular resources such as textbooks. This study introduces readers to
   an analytical framework for examining CAS-S within textbooks and
   presents the results of its application to three secondary U.S.
   mathematics textbook units involving polynomial functions. The framework
   consists of two components: application of CAS-S and reflection on CAS-S
   uses. The analyses identified differences among the three textbook units
   in pedagogical intent and task connectedness involving CAS-S. The
   majority of CAS-S tasks were coded as involving low procedural
   complexity and there were few instances in which the technology was used
   in the construction of proofs. Textbook developers asked students to
   reflect on the visible CAS-S result as opposed to the invisible process
   leading to those results. The implications of these results as well as
   the potential transformative role of CAS-S are discussed.},

Abstract = {The instruction of mathematically talented students (MTS) in
   heterogeneous classes is an issue of debate. Questions of equity,
   differential instruction, teacher awareness of their talented students'
   needs, and their willingness and competence to face the challenges of
   nurturing these students are all raised within this context. Our
   international study compared South Korean, American, and Israeli
   teachers of mathematics perspectives concerning their (a) perceived
   competence to teach MTS (b) perceived competence in addressing MTS'
   needs through differential instruction, (c) support for separation of
   MTS into special math classes, and (d) equity views concerning MTS'
   needs. Data was collected by means of a questionnaire presented to 80
   South Korean, 145 Israeli, and 58 American teachers of mathematics.
   Findings suggested that most teachers in these countries perceived
   themselves as competent to teach MTS, while very few of the participants
   supported the separation of MTS into special classes. South Korean
   teachers perceived themselves to be less competent in teaching MTS as
   well as in applying differential instruction and agreed more than their
   foreign counterparts that the fostering of mathematically weak students
   is more important than the fostering of MTS. Teachers who had some
   mathematical background appeared to perceive themselves as more
   competent to teach MTS than teachers who had no mathematical background.
   Teachers who predominantly taught large classes felt less competent to
   teach MTS than teachers who predominantly taught medium-sized classes.
   Findings were partially interpreted within the perspective of cultural
   differences. Recommendations for teachers' professional development are
   drawn.},

Abstract = {The central assumption of this paper is that, especially in the field of
   digital technologies to teach and learn mathematics, the influence of
   the context in which research is carried out has not been given enough
   attention, so that research results are not really useful outside this
   context. We base our discussion on the work of a group of European teams
   carrying out research with a special methodology of ``cross-studies{''}
   and carrying out ``cross-analyses{''} of particular studies. A context
   for a research study is described as a dynamic construction by
   researchers, connecting relevant contextual characteristics in the
   settings (empirical and academic) where research activity takes place
   and helping to gain insight from the outcomes of the study. Analyzing
   the design of two ``Didactical Digital Artefacts,{''} and the associated
   cross-studies involving teams of three countries, we identify more or
   less conscious influences of characteristics in the researchers'
   contexts upon research outcomes. Cross-studies and cross-analysis help
   to go further by making researchers more aware of their context and of
   its characteristics. It also helps researchers to
   ``re-contextualize,{''} that is to say to identify new contextual
   characteristics in the settings they are acting in, to gain insight from
   research outcomes that emerged in other contexts.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explored how engagement developed over time during a
   proportional reasoning unit for a group of US bilingual Latino/a
   students, with particular attention to aspects of social and cultural
   activity that supported students' engagement. Our findings suggest that
   student mathematical engagement developed primarily as a relational
   process characterized by students' social relations across time, their
   understandings about their relationships with mathematics, and the
   important relations emerging across proportional reasoning ideas.},

Title = {The meaning of mathematics instruction in multilingual classrooms:
   analyzing the importance of responsibility for learning},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {In the multilingual mathematics classroom, the assignment for teachers
   to scaffold students by means of instruction and guidance in order to
   facilitate language progress and learning for all is often emphasized.
   In Sweden, where mathematics education is characterized by a low level
   of teacher responsibility for students' performance, this responsibility
   is in part passed on to students. However, research investigating the
   complexity of relations between mathematics teaching and learning in
   multilingual classrooms, as well as effect studies of mathematics
   teaching, often take the existence of teachers' responsibility for
   offering specific content activities for granted. This study
   investigates the relations between different aspects of responsibility
   in mathematics teaching and students' performance in the multilingual
   mathematics classroom. The relationship between different group
   compositions and how the responsibility is expressed is also
   investigated. Multilevel structural equation models using TIMSS 2003
   data identified a substantial positive influence on mathematics
   achievement of teachers taking responsibility for students' learning
   processes by organizing and offering a learning environment where the
   teacher actively and openly supports the students in their mathematics
   learning, and where the students also are active and learn mathematics
   themselves. A correlation was also revealed between group composition,
   in terms of students' social and linguistic background, and how
   mathematics teaching was performed. This relationship indicates
   pedagogical segregation in Swedish mathematics education by teachers
   taking less responsibility for students' learning processes in classes
   with a high proportion of students born abroad or a high proportion of
   students with low socio-economic status.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the understanding of infinity in children,
   teachers and primary teacher students. It focuses on a number of
   difficulties that people cope with when dealing with problems related to
   infinity such as its abstract nature, understanding of infinity as an
   ongoing process which never ends, understanding of infinity as a set of
   an infinite number of elements and understanding of well-known
   paradoxes. In the empirical section of the article, a study is described
   that was conducted at the Faculty of Education, University of Ljubljana,
   Slovenia. It encompassed 93 third-year students of the Primary Teacher
   Education study programme with the aim of researching their
   understanding of the concept of infinity. The focus was on finding out
   how primary teacher students who received no in-depth instruction on
   abstract mathematical content understand different types of infinity:
   infinitely large, infinitely many and infinitely close, what
   argumentation they provide for their answers to problems on infinity and
   what their basic misunderstandings about infinity are. The results show
   that the respondents' understanding of infinity depends on the type of
   the task and on the context of the task. The respondents' justifications
   for the solutions are based both on actual and on potential infinity.
   When solving tasks of the types `infinitely large' and `infinitely
   many', they provide justifications based on actual infinity. When
   solving tasks of the type `infinitely close', they use arguments based
   on potential infinity. We conclude that when they feel unsure of
   themselves, they resort to their primary method of dealing with
   infinity, that is, to potential infinity.},

Abstract = {In this study, we explored the structural relationship between the
   students' perceived use of cognitive and metacognitive reading
   strategies (CMRS) and their reading comprehension of geometry proof
   (RCGP), and we also examined the differences in students' perceived use
   of reading strategies among the poor, moderate and good comprehenders. A
   sample of ninth graders (N = 533) completed a RCGP test and then the
   CMRS questionnaire. In the exploratory factor analysis with one
   subsample (n = 150), principal component analysis was used to extract
   factors of CMRS use for improving the CMRS instrument. Another subsample
   of students (n = 370) participated in the study on the confirmatory
   factor analysis with structural equation modelling method. Results
   revealed that the use of metacognitive reading strategies exerts an
   executive function over that of cognitive reading strategies, which
   directly influenced students' RCGP. Our interesting findings were that
   good comprehenders tended to employ more metacognitive reading
   strategies for planning and monitoring comprehension and more cognitive
   reading strategies for elaborating proof compared with the moderate
   comprehenders, who in turn employed these strategies more often compared
   with the poor comprehenders.},

Abstract = {The present study focuses on the accumulation process involved in the
   integration of a single-variable function. Observing the work of two
   high-school calculus students who had not yet learned any other
   integral-related ideas, we analyze the emergence of the semiotic
   relationship between personal and mathematical meanings, as expressed
   through the understanding of mathematical signs in integration tasks.
   Adopting Radford's educational perspective whereby learning is defined
   as a process of objectification, we identify a three-stage evolution of
   the double semiotic meaning of the lower boundary and of its role in the
   definition of the accumulation graph: (1) objectifying a zero
   accumulation in relation to the lower limit, (2) objectifying zero as
   marking the zero sum of accumulated areas, and (3) objectifying the
   accumulation graph as dependent on the lower-limit value. This evolution
   is marked by semiotic changes related to the pivotal role of the
   ``zeros{''} in the accumulation graph.},

Abstract = {This paper presents findings from a comparative analysis of three
   similar secondary geometry texts, one critical unit, one standards-based
   reform unit, and one specialist chapter. I developed the critical unit
   as I took the tenets of critical mathematics (CM) and substantiated them
   in printed curricular materials in which to teach as part of a larger
   study. The reform and specialist texts were both sections from
   commercially available textbooks. The primary goal of the textual
   analysis was to examine how the incorporation of critical or political
   themes into the required secondary mathematics curriculum transformed
   this curriculum. Key findings were that the CM text exchanged political
   for mathematical content and sent class-based messages about students'
   academic potential. I conclude by arguing that the CM agenda proposed by
   advocates in the USA is problematic in terms of promoting equity in
   mathematics education.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop analytical tools for studying
   mathematical communication in collaborative activities. The theoretical
   construct of contextualization is elaborated methodologically in order
   to study diversity in individual thinking in relation to effective
   communication. The construct of contextualization highlights issues of
   diversity in collaborative activities as it emphasizes how students may
   struggle differently with a learning activity. The interaction of
   students (12 to 13 years old), playing a specifically designed dice
   game, is used as an example for illustration. The article shows how
   accounting for the focal events of the interlocutors, and the contexts
   in which they contextualize these events, help in organizing our
   thinking about mathematically effective communication in collaborative
   activities.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider gestures as part of the resources activated
   in the mathematics classroom: speech, inscriptions, artifacts, etc. As
   such, gestures are seen as one of the semiotic tools used by students
   and teacher in mathematics teaching-learning. To analyze them, we
   introduce a suitable model, the semiotic bundle. It allows focusing on
   the relationships of gestures with the other semiotic resources within a
   multimodal approach. It also enables framing the mediating action of the
   teacher in the classroom: in this respect, we introduce the notion of
   semiotic game where gestures are one of the major ingredients.},

Abstract = {I begin by appreciating the contributions in the volume that indirectly
   and directly address the questions: Why do gestures and embodiment
   matter to mathematics education, what has understanding of these
   achieved and what might they achieve? I argue, however, that
   understanding gestures can in general only play an important role in
   `grasping' the meaning of mathematics if the whole object-orientated
   `activity' is taken into account in our perspective, and give examples
   from my own work and from this Special Issue. Finally, I put forward the
   notion of a `threshold' moment, where seeing and grasping at the nexus
   of two or more activities often seem to be critical to breakthroughs in
   learning.},

Title = {Interactional practices of inviting minoritized students to whole-class
   mathematics discussions},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 22},
Abstract = {Distributing opportunities to participate in talk-in-interaction during
   whole-class mathematics discussions is an important equity issue, with
   multiple studies reporting pervasive inequitable participation patterns
   in mathematics classrooms. Less attention, however, has been given to
   the underlying interactional practices that can initiate and support
   minoritized students' participation. This article examines how and what
   kinds of opportunities for participation are interactionally generated
   for minoritized students in whole-class mathematics discussions in two
   US high school classrooms. Through the lenses of turn-taking
   organizations and epistemic dimensions from conversation analysis, this
   study details the interactional features of turn-taking by three Black
   students in predominantly White classrooms. The analysis shows the
   importance of establishing epistemic congruence about the nature of
   students' knowledge before inviting them to take up the conversational
   floor. The findings imply that locally achieved, mutual understanding of
   what minoritized students know in the moment-by-moment classroom
   interaction is an important interactional feature for making minoritized
   students' brilliance more visible during whole-class discussions.},

Abstract = {We use Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory to study students'
   geometric understanding of partial derivatives of functions of two
   variables. This study contributes to research on the teaching and
   learning of differential multivariable calculus and its didactics. This
   is an important area due to its multiple applications in science,
   mathematics, engineering, and technology (STEM). The study tests a
   previously proposed model of mental constructions students may use to
   understand partial derivatives through a set of activities designed to
   help students make the conjectured constructions. The model is based on
   the local linearity of differentiable two-variable functions, and the
   model-based activities explore the relationship between partial
   derivatives and tangent plane in different representations. We used
   semi-structured interviews with eleven students whose teacher used the
   three-part cycle-Activities designed with the genetic decomposition;
   collaborative work in small groups and Class discussion; and Exercises
   for home (ACE)-as pedagogical strategy. The model-based activity set
   based on local linearity and the ACE strategy helped students construct
   a geometric understanding of partial derivatives. Results led to
   reconsider and further refine the model. This study also resulted in
   improving activity sets and obtaining information on students'
   construction of second-order and mixed partial derivatives.},

Abstract = {Prospective teachers' mathematics efficacy beliefs affect school
   placement experiences and influence later teacher behaviour and
   subsequent student outcomes. These efficacy beliefs are open to change
   during initial teacher education and become more resistant to change
   once the teacher enters the workforce. Therefore, it is important to
   measure mathematics teacher efficacy early in initial teacher education
   and identify low efficacy beliefs. This study measured the mathematics
   teaching efficacy beliefs of 402 prospective primary teachers. Arising
   from Rasch analysis of the efficacy scores of these teachers, 22
   participants who displayed a range of mathematics teaching efficacy
   beliefs were interviewed to gain insights into factors affecting these
   beliefs. Participants communicated greater confidence in tasks requiring
   procedural (tell-items) than conceptual knowledge (explain-items). Both
   low and high efficacy participants reported traditional experiences of
   mathematics teaching and learning as students. However, high efficacy
   participants reported mastery of mathematics within these traditional
   contexts, whereas their low efficacy peers did not report mastery.
   Furthermore, all participants reported how memories of their school
   mathematics experiences informed their level of efficacy when thinking
   about teaching mathematics, thus revealing the powerful influence of
   mastery experiences.},

Abstract = {Mathematicians frequently attend their peers' lectures to learn new
   mathematical content. The goal of this paper is to investigate what
   mathematicians learned from the lectures. Our research took place at a
   2-week workshop on inner model theory, a topic of set theory, which was
   largely comprised of a series of lectures. We asked the six workshop
   organizers and seven conference attendees what could be learned from the
   lectures in the workshop, and from mathematics lectures in general. A
   key finding was that participants felt the motivation and road maps that
   were provided by the lecturers could facilitate the attendees' future
   individual studying of the material. We conclude by discussing how our
   findings inform the development of theory on how individuals can learn
   from lectures and suggest interesting directions for future research.},

Title = {``Where does the square go?{''}: reinterpreting shapes when solving a
   tangram puzzle},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {112},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-47},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Thirty-seven third graders and thirty-two first graders engaged in
   solving a tangram puzzle in the shape of a fox. They had five minutes to
   solve the puzzle, and after this time, they received guidance on the
   particular piece they had difficulties with. Through the lenses of
   navigating flexible abstraction, reinterpretation, combinations, and
   borrowing structure to expand upon the existing 2D shape composition and
   decomposition learning trajectory, we examined ways in which students'
   puzzle-solving processes and their challenges related to the fox
   puzzle's features. Students' initial shape placements suggest that parts
   of the fox puzzle primed the use of particular pieces, which reduced the
   abstraction of the puzzle. The most challenging part of the puzzle for
   students was navigating reinterpretation to place the square and two
   small triangles on the fox's head in nonstandard orientations. Even
   though students faced challenges at different steps, they overcame them
   similarly by trying new combinations and by borrowing structure. Some
   students did not complete the puzzle even though they used flips and
   turns (reinterpretation) strategically. The results suggest potential
   modifications of the current learning trajectory to account for
   differences between tangram and pattern block puzzles and differences
   due to tangram puzzles' features. Because the puzzle's features played a
   role in students' challenges, future work needs to focus on the
   interaction between students' puzzle-solving processes and puzzles'
   features for a variety of tangram puzzles.},

Title = {Changes in students' self-efficacy when learning a new topic in
   mathematics: a micro-longitudinal study},

Abstract = {Self-efficacy in mathematics is related to engagement, persistence, and
   academic performance. Prior research focused mostly on examining changes
   to students' self-efficacy across large time intervals (months or
   years), and paid less attention to changes at the level of lesson
   sequences. Knowledge of how self-efficacy changes during a sequence of
   lessons is important as it can help teachers better support students'
   self-efficacy in their everyday work. In this paper, we expanded
   previous studies by investigating changes in students' self-efficacy
   across a sequence of 3-4 lessons when students were learning a new topic
   in mathematics (n(Students) = 170, n(Time-points) = 596). Nine classes
   of Norwegian grade 6 (n = 77) and grade 10 students (n = 93) reported
   their self-efficacy for easy, medium difficulty, and hard tasks. Using
   multilevel models for change, we found (a) change of students'
   self-efficacy across lesson sequences, (b) differences in the starting
   point and change of students' self-efficacy according to perceived task
   difficulty and grade, (c) more individual variation of self-efficacy
   starting point and change in association with harder tasks, and (d)
   students in classes who were taught a new topic in geometry had stronger
   self-efficacy at the beginning of the first lesson as compared to those
   who were taught a new topic in algebra (grade 10), and students in
   classes who were taught a new topic in fractions had steeper growth
   across the lesson sequence as compared to those who were taught a new
   topic in measurement (grade 6). Implications for both research and
   practice on how new mathematics topics are introduced to students are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {An essential task for mathematics teachers is posing problems. Selecting
   mathematics problems that develop mathematical proficiency and engage
   students in desirable mathematical practices is a critical
   decision-making process. We present the Framework for Posing Elementary
   Mathematics Problems (F-PosE) developed to focus prospective teacher
   noticing on desirable features of mathematics problems and inform
   decision-making processes around the selection of problems for use in
   elementary classrooms. Development of the framework was informed by a
   three-phase design research process consisting of an extensive review of
   the literature, document content analysis and successive testing of
   mathematics problems in elementary classrooms in partnership with
   teachers and children. Consequently, it draws from emergent practice
   informed by the collective endeavour of a community of educators. The
   framework consists of eight indicators: use of a motivating and engaging
   context, clarity in language and cultural context, curriculum coherence,
   attention to cognitive demand, an appropriate number of solution steps
   to support reasoning, a variety of solution strategies, facilitating
   multiple solutions and opportunity for success. This F-PosE provides a
   critical focusing lens for prospective teachers when creating and
   selecting mathematics problems specifically for use in elementary
   classrooms.},

Title = {Generating mathematical knowledge in the classroom through proof,
   refutation, and abductive reasoning},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {109},
Number = {3},
Pages = {567-591},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Proving and refuting are fundamental aspects of mathematical practice
   that are intertwined in mathematical activity in which conjectures and
   proofs are often produced and improved through the back-and-forth
   transition between attempts to prove and disprove. One aspect
   underexplored in the education literature is the connection between this
   activity and the construction by students of knowledge, such as
   mathematical concepts and theorems, that is new to them. This issue is
   significant to seeking a better integration of mathematical practice and
   content, emphasised in curricula in several countries. In this paper, we
   address this issue by exploring how students generate mathematical
   knowledge through discovering and handling refutations. We first
   explicate a model depicting the generation of mathematical knowledge
   through heuristic refutation (revising conjectures/proofs through
   discovering and addressing counterexamples) and draw on a model
   representing different types of abductive reasoning. We employed both
   models, together with the literature on the teachers' role in
   orchestrating whole-class discussion, to analyse a series of classroom
   lessons involving secondary school students (aged 14-15 years, Grade 9).
   Our analysis uncovers the process by which the students discovered a
   counterexample invalidating their proof and then worked via creative
   abduction where a certain theorem was produced to cope with the
   counterexample. The paper highlights the roles played by the teacher in
   supporting the students' work and the importance of careful task design.
   One implication is better insight into the form of activity in which
   students learn mathematical content while engaging in mathematical
   practice.},

Abstract = {This article presents a research apparatus for investigating and making
   sense of stories that emerge from feedback that mathematicians provide
   on students' proofs. Using the commognitive framework, the notion of
   didactical discourse on proof is developed as a lens for conceptualizing
   mathematicians' practice of feedback provision. The notion is
   accompanied by a tentative organizational frame, within which
   didacticians and mathematicians can operate as partners. The
   methodological affordances of this apparatus are illustrated with a case
   study of a research topologist, who taught a small, graduate course in
   topology. The emerged characteristics of her feedback and discourse are
   situated in the literature and used to sketch future research avenues.},

Abstract = {It is widely assumed that teachers play a key role in providing
   high-quality learning opportunities to students and fostering students'
   learning. Yet it is still unclear how specific teacher knowledge facets
   as part of their professional competence contribute to classroom
   processes and learning outcomes. Focusing on mathematics education at
   the secondary level, this study investigates the links between teachers'
   pedagogical competence (i.e., cognitive pedagogical facets of their
   professional competence), instructional quality, and students'
   mathematics achievement. The sample comprises mathematics teacher and
   student data from 59 classrooms in Germany. Student mathematics
   achievement was measured across two time points (grade 7 and 8).
   Teachers' pedagogical competence was tested using two tests measuring
   their general pedagogical knowledge (GPK) and situation-specific
   classroom management expertise (CME). Instructional quality was measured
   using observational rating data from in vivo rating in mathematics
   classrooms. Research questions on the relation of teachers' competence
   and students' mathematics achievement were answered using multilevel
   models. Results from multilevel regression analyses indicate that both
   GPK and CME predict instructional quality. Direct statistical effects on
   students' mathematical progress were identified, whereas no indirect
   statistical effects via instructional quality could be identified.
   Although teachers' measured pedagogical competence is not
   subject-specific, it serves as a significant predictor for cognitive
   activation as an indispensable part of quality-oriented mathematical
   teaching and learning processes in the lower secondary mathematics
   classroom, and it contributes to students' mathematical progress.},

Abstract = {In this work, we report the emergence of the Hands, Head and Heart
   framework that arose within the curriculum review for subject knowledge
   courses for primary school pre-service teachers in the National
   Institute of Education, Singapore. Through an initial grounded analysis
   of a survey of pre-service teachers and faculty focus group meeting
   data, the responses were broadly categorised into hands, head and heart
   domains and these formed an initial framework for discussions in the
   review committee meetings. By revisiting the data from the survey, an
   analysis through a complexity lens revealed the emergence of a
   characteristic nested self-similarity of the framework. Over the course
   of several committee meetings, further self-similarity was discovered.
   We conjecture that the Hands, Head and Heart framework and its
   self-similarity property provide a potential basis for a holistic
   approach to curriculum review. We used this framework to revise the
   learning objectives of the subject knowledge curriculum by resolving
   perspectives which previously seemed contradictory.},

Abstract = {This paper describes elementary students' awareness and representation
   of the aggregate properties and variability of data sets when engaged in
   predictive reasoning. In a design study, 46 third-graders interpreted a
   table of historical temperature data to predict and represent future
   monthly maximum temperatures. The task enabled students to interpret
   numbers in context and apply their understanding of inherent natural
   variation to create a generalised data set. Student predictions,
   representations, and written and verbal descriptions were analysed using
   two frameworks-Awareness of Mathematical Pattern and Structure (AMPS),
   and Data Lenses. While 54\% of students used the variability of the
   given data table to predict temperatures that were within the historical
   range for each month, only 20\% described the table by focusing on
   aggregate properties. Student representations varied from highly
   structured line and bar graphs to idiosyncratic drawings on
   weather-related themes. In total, 83\% of student representations were
   either idiosyncratic or direct copies of the data table. These findings
   suggest a progression in students' predictive reasoning, with an
   awareness of range and seasonal patterns emerging before a multifaceted
   aggregate view.},

Abstract = {Binary operations are one of the fundamental structures underlying our
   number and algebraic systems. Yet, researchers have often left their
   role implicit as they model student understanding of abstract
   structures. In this paper, we directly analyze students' perceptions of
   the general binary operation via a two-phase study consisting of
   task-based surveys and interviews. We document what attributes of binary
   operation group theory students perceive as critical and what types of
   metaphors students use to convey these attributes. We found that many
   students treat superficial features as critical (such as
   element-operator-element formatting) and do not always perceive critical
   features as essential (such as the binary attribute). Further, these
   attributes were communicated across three metaphor categories:
   arithmetic-related, function-related, and organization-related.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I theorize reciprocal noticing as a relational practice
   through which teachers and students exchange roles as knowers by
   reciprocating each other's noticing as they study mathematics concepts.
   Findings from a unit on measuring time implemented in two classrooms
   with non-dominant students illustrate how teachers and students-through
   their reciprocal noticing-mobilize concepts back to previous
   understandings and forward to possible new meanings. These findings
   serve to recalibrate the focus on professionalization of the teaching
   practice by considering how an inclusive understanding of noticing
   permits to appreciate the process of teachers and students sharing the
   process of learning mathematics in relationships.},

Abstract = {This paper illuminates challenges confronting teachers and students at
   the literacy/numeracy interface in contexts where students have not
   developed sufficient English language proficiency to be learning
   mathematics through English but, due to socio-politically and
   economically driven perceptions are being taught in English. We analyse
   transcript data of classroom talk in a South African grade 4 mathematics
   lesson on fractions. Together with interview data, the lesson data
   highlight some of the consequences students' diminished access to their
   home language appear to have on their access to mathematical
   meaning-making.},

Abstract = {Mathematics-related affect comprises an individual's attitudes, beliefs,
   emotions and motivations towards mathematics. These affective constructs
   have been widely studied in mathematics education and cognitive
   psychology and have been shown to be related to cognitive outcomes such
   as performance on a range of mathematical tasks. However, it is not yet
   clear how these constructs develop, or how they relate to cognitive
   factors in young children who are in the early stages of learning
   mathematics. As such, the current special issue focuses on
   mathematics-related affect in primary school children aged 4 to 10years.
   It brings together five recent empirical studies and two discussant
   articles looking at the development of attitudes, beliefs, emotions and
   motivations towards mathematics, and the relations between affective and
   cognitive factors in these young age groups. In this introductory paper,
   we provide some brief historical context, followed by a rationale for
   the special issue, and an overview of its structure and scope.},

Abstract = {Most studies of children's attitudes to mathematics have dealt with
   children in second grade or later, and have suggested that attitudes
   deteriorate, and anxiety increases with age. The present study
   investigated attitudes to mathematics in 67 English and 49 Chinese
   children at the end of their first year of school. The participants were
   given Thomas and Dowker's (2000) Mathematics Attitude Questionnaire,
   which uses pictorial rating scales to assess primary school children's
   mathematics anxiety, liking for mathematics, unhappiness at poor
   performance in mathematics, and self-rating in mathematics. They were
   also given the British Abilities Scales Basic Number Skills test.
   Attitudes were generally positive, though not more so than previously
   found for older primary school children. The Chinese children performed
   better in the arithmetic test and also rated themselves higher than the
   English children, but did not differ in other attitudes. Self-rating in
   mathematics and lack of unhappiness at poor performance were associated
   with better performance in the English group. There were no significant
   relationships between attitudes and performance in the Chinese group.
   Implications of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this 3-year longitudinal study, we examined the interplay of
   children's motivational orientations, spontaneous focusing on numerosity
   (SFON) and number sequence and arithmetical skills from kindergarten (at
   age 6) to grade 1 (at age 7). We also examined the direct and indirect
   contributions of motivation and SFON to the acquisition of arithmetical
   skills from grades 1 to 2 (at age 8). The study involved 136
   Finnish-speaking, typically developing children. Teacher ratings were
   used to assess the children's motivational orientations (i.e., task
   orientation, task avoidance orientation and social dependence
   orientation) in kindergarten and grade 1. Number sequence skills and
   SFON were evaluated in kindergarten, and arithmetical skills were
   assessed in kindergarten, grade 1 and grade 2. A theoretical model of
   the relationships among the variables was proposed, and the associations
   were analysed using path analysis. The results showed that task
   orientation, social dependence orientation and task avoidance
   orientation were each unique predictors of later arithmetical
   achievement. Furthermore, together with arithmetical skills in grade 1
   and counting abilities in kindergarten, they helped to predict
   arithmetical achievement in grade 2. Motivational orientations did not
   explain the significant contributions of SFON to later arithmetical
   skills. The study suggests that both motivational orientations and SFON
   require attention and scaffolding in educational contexts, such as
   assessment and teacher-child interaction from early on.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the issue of gender and mathematics
   participation, focusing on the ways in which ``clever girls{''}
   self-author within the discourse order of a high ability group, which
   has particular significance in the Norwegian context in which this study
   took place. Contrasting the cases of three girls, only one of whom
   (Anna) chooses to continue with a higher level of mathematics
   (mathematics for science), we consider the ways in which they manage
   being members of the ``smart group{''}. We analyse in particular the
   storying of Anna as a ``nerd{''} and the social cost of being a ``clever
   girl{''} against the backdrop of a public discourse of equality of
   opportunity in Norway.},

Abstract = {Children who experience difficulties with learning mathematics should be
   taught by teachers who focus on the child's best way of learning.
   Analyses of the mathematical difficulties are necessary for fine-tuning
   mathematics education to the needs of these children. For this reason,
   an instrument for Observing and Analyzing children's Mathematical
   Development (OAMD), based on action theory, has been developed. The use
   of levels of action is a new insight in the diagnostic process. Using
   the OAMD makes it possible to explore and analyze a child's knowledge,
   proficiency and possible difficulties on four levels of acting in the
   domain of Number (counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication and
   division). The research concerns children from kindergarten up to grade
   three. In this article, we will discuss the purpose and the construction
   of the instrument with the focus on the usability of the OAMD. The study
   examines the quality and the diagnostic value of the instrument by means
   of the internal consistency, the test-retest reliability and the
   construct validity. The analyses show positive results. The conclusion
   of the research is that the OAMD is a suitable instrument for the
   analysis of numerical development of young children and their possible
   difficulties in this domain.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Volume = {92},
Number = {3},
Pages = {379-393},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Two questions about certainty in mathematics are asked. First, is
   mathematical knowledge known with certainty? Second, why is the belief
   in the certainty of mathematical knowledge so widespread and where does
   it come from? This question is little addressed in the literature. In
   explaining the reasons for these beliefs, both cultural-historical and
   individual psychological factors are identified. The cultural
   development of mathematics contributes four factors: (1) the invariance
   and conservation of number and the reliability of calculation; (2) the
   emergence of numbers as abstract entities with apparently independent
   existence; (3) the emergence of proof with its goal of convincing
   readers of certainty of mathematical results; (4) the engulfment of
   historical contradictions and uncertainties and their incorporation into
   the mathematical narrative of certainty. Individual learners of
   mathematics internalize ideas of invariance, reliability and certainty
   through their classroom experiences and exposure to such cultural
   factors. Lastly, with regard to the first question, it is concluded that
   mathematics can be known with a certainty circumscribed by the limits of
   human knowing.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {92},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-73},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper aims to critique and develop neo-Vygotskian work in
   mathematics education from (i) within the Vygotskian and activity
   theoretic tradition, and where necessary from (ii) a Bourdieusian
   perspective. First, I critique Roth and Radford's (2011) version of
   Cultural-historical Activity Theory, suggesting that a classroom episode
   presented as developmental might be seen as a process of alienation. I
   trace this to the institutional structure of schooling, in which
   curriculum and pedagogy are alienated from the learner's everyday sense.
   Next, I examine and critique the Vygotskian `Funds of Knowledge'
   approach to critical mathematics education, which seeks to overcome
   alienation by subjecting the curriculum to the needs of the poor
   communities the school serves. Here, the critical point on alienation in
   the Vygotskian approach is better argued in Bourdieu's perspective on
   educational institutions as reproductive of class domination. Finally,
   the paper discusses the extent to which these critiques pertain to
   Vygotskian activity theory in general or only to these versions in
   particular and draws implications for the development of a critical
   mathematics education perspective in a synthesis of perspectives from
   Vygotsky and Bourdieu.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the contribution of quality mathematics teaching to
   student achievement gains. Quality of mathematics teaching is assessed
   through teacher demonstration of the five strands of mathematical
   proficiency, the level of cognitive task demands, and teacher
   mathematical knowledge. Data is based on 1907 grade 6 students who sat
   for the same test twice over an interval of about 10 months. The
   students were drawn from a random selection of 72 low- and
   high-performing primary schools. Multi-level regression shows the
   effects of quality mathematics teaching at both individual and school
   levels, while controlling for other variables that influence
   achievement. Results show that students in low-performing schools gained
   more by 6 \% when mathematics instruction involved high-level cognitive
   task demands, with two thirds of all the lessons observed demonstrating
   the strands of mathematics proficiency during instruction. The
   implication to education is that quality of mathematics instruction is
   more critical in improving learning gains among low-performing students.},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to introduce the topic of learning to reason
   from samples, which is the focus of this special issue of Educational
   Studies in Mathematics on statistical reasoning. Samples are data sets,
   taken from some wider universe (e.g., a population or a process) using a
   particular procedure (e.g., random sampling) in order to be able to make
   generalizations about this wider universe with a particular level of
   confidence. Sampling is hence a key factor in making reliable
   statistical inferences. We first introduce the theme and the key
   questions this special issue addresses. Then, we provide a brief
   literature review on reasoning about samples and sampling. This review
   sets the grounds for the introduction of the five articles and the
   concluding reflective discussion. We close by commenting on the ways to
   support the development of students' statistical reasoning on samples
   and sampling..},

Abstract = {Teachers notice through the lens of their professional knowledge and
   views. This study hence focuses not solely on teachers' noticing, but
   also on their knowledge and views, which allows insight into how
   noticing is informed and shaped by professional knowledge. As a
   discipline-specific perspective for noticing we chose dealing with
   multiple representations, since they play a double role for learning
   mathematics: On the one hand they are essential for mathematical
   understanding, but on the other hand they can also be an obstruction for
   learning. This comparative study takes into account pre-service as well
   as in-service teachers in order to explore the role of teaching
   experience for such professional knowledge, views and noticing. The
   participants answered a questionnaire addressing different components of
   specific knowledge and views. For eliciting the teachers' theme-specific
   noticing, vignette-based questions were used. The data analysis was done
   mainly by quantitative methods, but was complemented by a qualitative
   in-depth analysis focusing on how the teachers' theme-specific noticing
   was informed by different components of their professional knowledge.
   The results suggest that pre-service as well as in-service teachers do
   not fully understand the key role of multiple representations for
   learning mathematics in the sense of their discipline-specific
   significance. The participating in-service teachers distinguished
   themselves however from the pre-service teachers especially regarding
   their theme-specific noticing. Moreover, the evidence indicates that
   teachers' noticing of critical instances of dealing with multiple
   representations draws on situated as well as on global knowledge and
   views.},

Abstract = {This article presents findings from an ongoing study focused on
   deconstructing pedagogical practices of successful mathematics teachers
   in classrooms with high populations of traditionally underserved
   students. Using grounded theory, the manuscript reports on general
   themes and specific practices of culturally responsive mathematics
   teaching (CRMT) that have been ``unearthed{''} from data collected over
   several years in three diverse mathematics classrooms. The findings
   indicate that, regardless of cultural setting, relationships and trust
   are central to CRMT, while communication patterns and various forms of
   knowledge mediate these relationships. Ultimately, CRMT provides student
   access, which is mediated by culture and identity, to complex
   mathematical ideas. Common concrete practices, such as warm demander
   pedagogy and reflection, are discussed. These results speak to the
   complexity of the culturally responsive mathematics classroom and
   provide suggestions to educators, administrators, and teacher educators
   who aim to become more culturally responsive.},

Abstract = {In this article, I present and build on the ideas of John Threlfall
   {[}(Educational Studies in Mathematics 50:29-47, 2002)] about strategy
   development in mental mathematics contexts. Focusing on the emergence of
   strategies rather than on issues of choice or flexibility of choice, I
   ground these ideas in the enactivist theory of cognition, particularly
   in issues of problem posing, for discussing the nature of the solving
   processes at play when solving mental mathematics problems. I complement
   this analysis and conceptualization by offering two examples about
   issues of emergence of strategies and of problem posing, in order to
   offer illustrations thereof, as well as to highlight the fruitfulness of
   this orientation for better understanding the processes at play in
   mental mathematics contexts.},

Abstract = {The nature of mathematical objects, their various types, the way in
   which they are formed, and how they participate in mathematical activity
   are all questions of interest for philosophy and mathematics education.
   Teaching in schools is usually based, implicitly or explicitly, on a
   descriptive/realist view of mathematics, an approach which is not free
   from potential conflicts. After analysing why this view is so often
   taken and pointing out the problems raised by realism in mathematics
   this paper discusses a number of philosophical alternatives in relation
   to the nature of mathematical objects. Having briefly described the
   educational and philosophical problem regarding the origin and nature of
   these objects we then present the main characteristics of a pragmatic
   and anthropological semiotic approach to them, one which may serve as
   the outline of a philosophy of mathematics developed from the point of
   view of mathematics education. This approach is able to explain from a
   non-realist position how mathematical objects emerge from mathematical
   practices.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to illustrate the analysis of episodes of chat
   sessions based on Charles Sanders Peirce's triadic sign relation. The
   episodes are from a project called ``Math-Chat{''}, which is based on
   the use of mathematical inscriptions in an experimental setting. What is
   characteristic of this chat setting is that pupils are required to
   document their attempts at solving mathematical problems as mutual
   inscriptions in written and graphical form. In order to analyze the
   outline, as well as the use and development of mutual inscriptions, a
   suitable instrument of analysis must first be developed. For this
   purpose, an interactionist approach is combined with a semiotic
   perspective. Through the incorporation of a semiotic perspective into an
   empirical study on learning mathematics at primary level, the
   development and use of such an instrument are demonstrated. In this way,
   both the development and also the structure of ``semiotic process
   cards{''} are explained. In conclusion, my findings related to the use
   of inscriptions in general and the use of inscriptions in
   primary-classroom problem-solving processes are presented.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to investigate the effects of a design experiment
   developed for third-grade students in the field of mathematics word
   problems. The main focus of the program was developing students'
   knowledge about word problem solving strategies with an emphasis on the
   role of visual representations in mathematical modeling. The experiment
   involved five experimental and six control classes (N = 106 and 138,
   respectively) of third-grade students. The experiment comprised 20
   lessons with 73 word problems, providing a systematic overview of the
   basic word problem types. Teachers of the experimental classes received
   a booklet containing lesson plans and overhead transparencies with
   different types of visual representations attached to the word problems.
   Students themselves were invited to make drawings for each task, and
   group work and teacher-led discussion shaped their beliefs about the
   role of visual representations in word problem solving. The effect sizes
   of the experiment were calculated from the results of two tests: an
   arithmetic skill and a word problem test, and the unbiased estimates for
   Cohen's d proved to be 0.20 and 0.62. There were significant changes
   also in experimental group students' beliefs about mathematics. The
   experiment pointed to the possibility, feasibility, and importance of
   learning about visual representations in mathematical word problem
   solving as early as in grade 3 (around age 9-10).},

Title = {Subspace in linear algebra: investigating students' concept images and

Abstract = {This paper reports on a study investigating students' ways of
   conceptualizing key ideas in linear algebra, with the particular results
   presented here focusing on student interactions with the notion of
   subspace. In interviews conducted with eight undergraduates, we found
   students' initial descriptions of subspace often varied substantially
   from the language of the concept's formal definition, which is very
   algebraic in nature. This is consistent with literature in other
   mathematical content domains that indicates that a learner's primary
   understanding of a concept is not necessarily informed by that concept's
   formal definition. We used the analytical tools of concept image and
   concept definition of Tall and Vinner (Educational Studies in
   Mathematics, 12(2):151-169, 1981) in order to highlight this distinction
   in student responses. Through grounded analysis, we identified recurring
   concept imagery that students provided for subspace, namely, geometric
   object, part of whole, and algebraic object. We also present results
   regarding the coordination between students' concept image and how they
   interpret the formal definition, situations in which students recognized
   a need for the formal definition, and qualities of subspace that
   students noted were consequences of the formal definition. Furthermore,
   we found that all students interviewed expressed, to some extent, the
   technically inaccurate ``nested subspace{''} conception that R-k is a
   subspace of R-n for k<n. We conclude with a discussion of this and how
   it may be leveraged to inform teaching in a productive, student-centered
   manner.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of contemporary retail industry and the
   ways in which young workers participate in that field. Public
   perceptions of low numeracy among young people provided the catalyst for
   the study. Drawing on a mixed-method approach involving survey, case
   studies, stimulated recall, observations, and interviews, it was found
   that young workers approach their numeracy in ways that have been shaped
   by their experiences, in particular, digital experiences. In contrast,
   older generations hold different views of young people's numeracy levels
   and skills, often perceiving them as poor and deficit. The study
   challenges the orthodoxy of older generations and argues that young
   workers have developed new ways of working, which align strongly with
   the post-industrial workplace. As a result, there are considerable
   tensions between the generations which need to be considered. The paper
   uses the work of Bourdieu and draws on his notions of habitus, field,
   and capital to theorize the outcomes.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to describe and analyse the structure of 3D
   geometry thinking by identifying different types of reasoning and to
   examine their relation with spatial ability. To achieve this goal, two
   tests were administered to students in grades 5 to 9. The results of the
   study showed that 3D geometry thinking could be described by four
   distinct types of reasoning which refer to the representation of 3D
   objects, spatial structuring, conceptualisation of mathematical
   properties and measurement. The analysis of the study also showed that
   3D geometry types of reasoning and spatial abilities should be modelled
   as different constructs. Finally, it was concluded that students'
   spatial abilities, which consist of spatial visualisation, spatial
   orientation and spatial relations factors, are a strong predictive
   factor of the four types of reasoning in 3D geometry thinking.},

Abstract = {Engaging students with multiple solution problems is considered good
   practice. Solutions to problems consist of the outcomes of the problem
   as well as the methods employed to reach these outcomes. In this study
   we analyze the results obtained from two groups of kindergarten children
   who engaged in one task, the Create an Equal Number Task. This task had
   five possible outcomes and five different methods which may be employed
   in reaching these outcomes. Children, whose teachers had attended the
   program Starting Right: Mathematics in Kindergartens, found more
   outcomes and employed more methods than children whose teachers did not
   attend this program. Results suggest that the habit of mind of searching
   for more than one outcome and employing more than one method may be
   promoted in kindergarten.},

Abstract = {In this article, I make a case for the inputs that Martin Heidegger's
   theoretical perspective offers to current concerns about the nature of
   mathematics, its teaching and learning, and the problem of subjectivity.
   In particular, I consider Heidegger's notion of positive science and
   discuss both its applicability to mathematics and its importance to
   mathematics education. I argue that Heidegger's ontological position is
   consonant with some sociocultural approaches in mathematics education
   and that Heidegger's work can shed some light on the problem of knowing
   and being. Finally, I raise some questions concerning subjectivity and
   the link between language and mathematical objects.},

Abstract = {How does classroom interaction support students' apprenticeship into the
   ways of speaking, writing, and diagramming that constitute the practice
   of mathematics? We address this problem through an interpretative
   analysis of a whole-group conversation about alternative ways of solving
   a problem involving percent discounts that occurred in a sixth grade
   classroom. This research study draws upon Dewey's theory of inquiry,
   Vygotsky's cultural-historical psychology, Freudenthal's realistic
   mathematics education, and Halliday's systemic functional linguistics
   (SFL). From Freudenthal, we borrow the notions of mathematizing and
   guided reinvention-the former notion offers a view of mathematics as an
   activity of structuring subject matter and the latter one provides
   insights into the processes whereby mathematizing is learned and taught
   in the classroom. We glean from Dewey his view of reflective thinking as
   inquiry and the role that conversations may serve therein. We rely upon
   Vygotsky's notions of a verbal thinking plane and a social phase of
   learning in order to reconsider the function of whole-class interaction
   in apprenticing students into mathematizing. Finally, SFL provides us
   with tools for explaining the choices of grammar and vocabulary students
   and teachers make as they realize meanings in whole-group conversations.
   Treating the selected whole-class conversation as a text, we focus our
   analysis on how this text came to mean what it did. Our central
   questions are as follows: What meanings were realized in the whole-class
   conversation by teacher and students and how were these meanings
   realized? How did the teacher's lexico-grammatical choices guide the
   students' choices? In addressing these questions, we advance an
   interpretation of the conversation as paradigmatic of students and
   teacher thinking aloud together about percents.},

Abstract = {Videotape is an increasingly used tool in cross-national studies of
   mathematics teaching. However, the means by which videotaped lessons are
   coded and analysed remains an underdeveloped area with scholars adopting
   substantially different approaches to the task. In this paper we present
   an approach based on generic descriptors of mathematics learning
   objectives. Exploiting live observations in five European countries, the
   descriptors were developed in a bottom-up recursive manner for
   application to videotaped lessons from four of these countries, Belgium
   (Flanders), England, Hungary and Spain. The analyses showed not only
   that the descriptors were consistently operationalised but also that
   they facilitated the identification of both similarities and differences
   in the ways in which teachers conceptualise and present mathematics that
   resonated with the available literature. In so doing we make both
   methodological and theoretical contributions to comparative mathematics
   research in general and debates concerning the national mathematics
   teaching script in particular.},

Abstract = {Our work is inspired by the book Imagining Numbers (particularly the
   square root of minus fifteen), by Harvard University mathematics
   professor Barry Mazur (Imagining numbers (particularly the square root
   of minus fifteen), Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 2003). The work
   of Mazur led us to question whether the features and steps of Mazur's
   re-enactment of the imaginative work of mathematicians could be
   appropriated pedagogically in a middle-school setting. Our research
   objectives were to develop the framework of teaching mathematics as a
   way of imagining and to explore the pedagogical implications of the
   framework by engaging in an application of it in middle school setting.
   Findings from our application of the model suggest that the framework
   presents a novel and important approach to developing mathematical
   understanding. The model demonstrates in particular the importance of
   shared visualizations and problem-posing in learning mathematics, as
   well as imagination as a cognitive space for learning.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated undergraduate mathematics students' (N =
   267) attitudes towards proving. The students were taking an
   introduction-to-proof type course that was situated at the beginning of
   the mathematics curriculum and lasted for one term. Four attitude
   variables were measured at the beginning and at the end of the course
   with a new self-report instrument: self-efficacy, anxiety, appreciation
   and motivation. The instrument was based on two existing instruments on
   mathematics attitudes and proof-related self-efficacy. We studied how
   these four attitude variables were related to the students' prior skills
   and their gender at the beginning of the course, how the attitude
   variables changed during the course, and how they affected the students'
   performance in the final course project. Our results indicate that
   students' prior performance is linked to their proof-related
   self-efficacy, anxiety and motivation at the beginning of the course.
   Female students exhibited lower efficacy and motivation levels than male
   students. During the focus course, students' self-efficacy increased and
   anxiety decreased. The gender gaps in self-efficacy and motivation
   persisted throughout the course. In addition, high motivation in the
   beginning of the course predicted good performance in the final project.
   Based on our results, we conclude that an introductory course on proving
   can enhance students' attitudes, and we suggest that these attitudes are
   taken into account in teaching as they can affect students' performance.
   Finally, we urge researchers and professionals to earnestly consider
   ways to mitigate gender differences in mathematics.},

Abstract = {Little is known about how teachers construct tests. For that reason,
   this study addresses the use of teacher-constructed tests for assessing
   educational goals, expressed in terms of student mathematical
   competencies. The focus is on meanings that upper secondary school
   mathematics teachers assign to their own test construction practices for
   assessing educational goals, expressed in terms of mathematical
   competencies in the curriculum. The methodological approach of grounded
   theory, underlined by symbolic interactionism, is applied to
   semi-structured interviews with teachers. The core category, the
   emerging taxonomy, is derived by revealing distinctions in degree of
   paying attention to competencies: no attention, superficial attention,
   and qualitative attention, as well as two different phases of the
   assessment: constructional and marking. Finally, a couple of possible
   implications for developing and improving test construction are offered.
   This includes collaborative work, inside and outside of schools, with
   both prospective and in-service teachers, for improvement of competence
   implementation in regular teaching and learning in alignment with
   mathematical content.},

Abstract = {The transition from school to university mathematics is a challenging
   process for many students, which is reflected in high dropout rates
   during the first year at university. Using mediation analysis, we want
   to shed light on the role of students' attitudes towards
   mathematics-especially their interest in mathematics and their
   mathematical self-concept-for early dropout and investigate the
   underlying mechanisms for the relations between attitudes and dropout.
   Informed by frameworks of person-environment-fit and results from
   educational psychology, we consider satisfaction with one's studies and
   achievement as potential mediators, influencing the relations between
   attitudes and early dropout. Our results within a sample of 274
   first-year students, enrolled in a pure mathematics or a teacher
   education program at a German university, show that interest in
   university mathematics and mathematical self-concept are associated with
   less risk to drop out. In the case of interest, this relation is
   mediated by students' satisfaction, and in the case of self-concept,
   this relation is mediated by satisfaction and achievement. Based on
   these results, we discuss how to support students during the transition
   from school to university mathematics in order to prevent early dropout.},

Abstract = {Our study aims to determine how Habermas' construct of rationality can
   serve to identify and interpret the difficulties experienced by
   university students in the mathematical problem-solving process. To this
   end, a problem which required modelling and solving a differential
   equation was used. The problem-solving processes of university students
   were analysed based on rationality components. The findings demonstrated
   that the problems in epistemic rationality such as predominance of the
   figure over the definition and/or theorems, use of dogmatic knowledge,
   intuitive generalizations, lack of prior knowledge, incorrect
   recognition of the differential equation prevented the choosing and
   using of an appropriate problem-solving method, leading to problems in
   teleological rationality. It was determined that the student performance
   in communicative rationality was negatively affected by problems in
   epistemic rationality such as using of knowledge acquired by rote and
   predominance of figure prototype on the definitions and/or theorems.
   Throughout the analysis, it is required to define two new
   sub-components, named ``geometric `` and ``algebraic `` representation
   under the modelling requirements of epistemic rationality. It is advised
   to use the extended version of Habermas' construct of rationality to
   examine the performance of students in mathematical activities to get
   more detailed and accurate results.},

Abstract = {In this study, the authors examined a group of related literatures that
   used the same large-scale nationally representative dataset with algebra
   achievement as the outcome to explore why results from the same dataset
   may differ across studies. More specially, the authors synthesized the
   extant research literature that utilized data from the High School
   Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) to investigate the student-,
   teacher-, school-, and parent-level characteristics associated with
   algebra achievement and whether these relationships were consistent
   across students' backgrounds (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender,
   socio-economic status, and prior achievement). The authors have
   summarized the results of 21 studies across 2 outcome variables (ninth-
   and eleventh-grade algebra achievement) using optimal resource theory as
   a framework to summarize evidence-based practices for improving student
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {The world is now facing the most severe health, social, and economic
   event of the last hundred years, which has made the need to acquire
   statistical thinking to interpret the information disseminated on a
   daily basis by the media clear to society. This article proposes a
   discussion on the role that statistics education might play in
   supporting the acquisition of such knowledge, contributing to the
   development of critical citizens, aware of their social responsibility.
   In this context, we present examples of curves and other charts to
   demonstrate how to use the several levels defined by experts in reading
   and interpreting the charts. At a more advanced level, these examples
   will allow discussion on the impacts of this epidemic on the most
   vulnerable population in Brazil. The charts presented reveal a great
   regional inequality, suggesting that mortality due to the virus is
   distinguished by region and micro-region when considering access to
   hospital beds. The examples signpost ways for educators to be able to
   develop projects or research based on the discussion on the reality of
   the pandemic, the necessary public policies, and how political
   coordination grounded on science and on a humanitarian vision would have
   mitigated the Brazilian tragedy.},

Abstract = {This article is a synthesis of the historical account of the ongoing
   suppression of Maori indigeneity (language and cultural knowledge) in
   mathematics education for over 100 years. During that time, Maori, the
   Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand, have been ravaged by the
   effects of globalisation as an outcome of colonisation, resulting in
   loss of property, linguistic, and cultural rights, that have been
   compounded by the damaging effects of diseases that have cumulatively
   sustained negative socioeconomic and education outcomes to this day. The
   COVID-19 pandemic, which arrived on Aotearoa New Zealand shores in
   February 2020, exposed and further exacerbated the deep inequities that
   already existed due to the legacy of assimilation policies. This article
   draws on Bourdieu's notions of capital, habitus, and field to frame our
   analysis of the capacity and potential for Maori to act as agents
   within, and against, multiple cultural and structural pressures that
   have impacted the historical development of Maori-medium mathematics
   education, and the capacity of the Maori-medium mathematics community to
   cope while schools were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This
   article reveals that despite some recent positive structural changes in
   response to the emergence of Maori-medium schooling in the 1980s, and
   partly due to the high status of mathematics educationally, many
   structural challenges remain. In 2020, in response to having to deliver
   mathematics education remotely, the Maori-medium community, including
   parents, teachers, and associates, used their individual and collective
   agency to overcome the structural barriers created by physical school
   closures.},

Abstract = {In this article, I present the eighteenth century's polemic of Bernoulli
   and d'Alembert concerning the smallpox epidemic and a prevention method
   called inoculation. Through an analysis of the polemic and the related
   resources, I show that this historical debate has various interests for
   mathematics education; and more specifically it can help teachers to
   confront dilemmas emerging with the COVID-19 pandemic (for example if a
   teacher should talk about it in class or not, how to help students to
   interpret the statistical data and the mathematical models connected to
   the pandemic and more generally, how to deal with the confusions and
   concerns emerging in connection to the pandemic). I describe the
   documents related to the historical polemic as transitional objects,
   having a potential to reveal the teachers' own professional or personal
   experiences, reflections and questions, and to stimulate dialogue with
   them on these issues. I illustrate this proposition by the presentation
   of an online reading seminar realized with a French group of teachers in
   April 2020.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the pedagogical content knowledge of mathematical
   modelling as part of the professional competence of pre-service
   teachers. With the help of a test developed for this purpose from a
   conceptual model, we examine whether this pedagogical content knowledge
   can be promoted in its different facets-especially knowledge about
   modelling tasks and about interventions-by suitable university seminars.
   For this purpose, the test was administered to three groups in a seminar
   for the teaching of mathematical modelling: (1) to those respondents who
   created their own modelling tasks for use with students, (2) to those
   trained to intervene in mathematical modelling processes, and (3)
   participating students who are not required to address mathematical
   modelling. The findings of the study-based on variance analysis-indicate
   that certain facets (knowledge of modelling tasks, modelling processes,
   and interventions) have increased significantly in both experimental
   groups but to varying degrees. By contrast, pre-service teachers in the
   control group demonstrated no significant change to their level of
   pedagogical content knowledge.},

Abstract = {We frame teachers' contextualization of mathematics (CoM) as a
   classroom-based identity resource. We explore CoM in secondary
   classrooms in the segregated school landscape of the US, focusing
   specifically on schools that serve primarily low-income Black and Latinx
   students. We review literature that discusses commonly-cited affordances
   for CoM according to formative, affective, functional literacy, and
   critical literacy rationales and problematize those rationales relative
   to prior research. We analyze 58 lessons from 12 classrooms at 11
   schools to reveal patterns in CoM relative to those commonly cited
   affordances. The formative, affective, and functional literacy
   rationales were frequently evident. Teachers draw largely on generic
   human experiences and marketplace contexts, positioning students as
   consumers or employees. There were few instances of CoM naming racism or
   inequality, and our analysis further reveals blind spots in these

Abstract = {Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) relies on the pedagogy of guided
   reinvention, in which opportunities for learning are created through the
   teacher's orchestration of whole-class mathematical discussion towards a
   specific goal. However, introducing an RME approach to students who are
   accustomed to traditional teaching requires a substantial shift in
   roles, particularly with respect to the devolution of authority from
   teacher to student. In this study, we worked with low-attaining
   students, implementing RME to improve understanding of fractions. The
   analysis highlights how the introduction of guided reinvention is
   supported by extended wait time and teacher neutrality, but also by
   teachers' appropriation of student strategies as a basis for supporting
   shared authority in the joint construction of mathematical ideas. The
   article considers the relationship between guided reinvention,
   appropriation and student agency.},

Abstract = {This study utilizes the Cartesian Connection and the action, process,
   object, and schema (APOS) theory to investigate how preservice
   mathematics teachers constructed and justified graphs of two-variable
   inequalities. The analysis shows that most teachers were not equipped
   with the skills and knowledge that were prerequisites for action,
   process, and object conceptions of two-variable inequality graphs. Many
   teachers used informal rules, rather than mathematical ideas such as the
   Cartesian Connection, to construct and/or justify inequality graphs.
   They also perceived inequality graphs as shapes rather than as
   representations based on the meaning of inequalities. I present a
   genetic decomposition for inequality graphs, through the concepts of
   variable and of parameter, as well as tasks associated with the genetic
   decomposition. I call for more studies on inequalities, including those
   relating to the implementation of the suggested genetic decomposition
   and tasks.},

Abstract = {Decades of research have documented young students' misinterpretations
   of the equal sign and the impediments these present for children's
   mathematical development. Much less is known about individual
   differences in adults' knowledge of the equal sign. We assessed 182
   college students from developmental math courses and present analyses
   from a subset of items on a previously validated assessment of
   mathematical equality. College students exhibited variability in their
   interpretations of the equal sign, and these individual differences were
   related both to their solutions for open equations with variables and to
   their interpretations of an algebraic expression. Students who provided
   a relational interpretation of the equal sign were most successful on
   target algebra problems and students who only provided an operational
   interpretation of the equal sign were least successful. These results
   show that misinterpretations of the equal sign can persist well beyond
   elementary school and can provide a critical indicator of broader
   mathematical reasoning among college students.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In my previous work, I criticised studies within the sociopolitical turn
   for disavowing a comprehension of schools as places of capitalist
   production. Here, I extend this critique to what is being flagged as a
   new turn in educational research. I am referring to biosocial research,
   particularly in the way it is coupled with new materialist and more than
   human philosophies in the work of Elizabeth de Freitas. I use elements
   from Marxian theory and Lacanian psychoanalysis to explore the
   concomitances between mathematics and capitalism, showing how both
   mathematics and capital need to suture the subject in order to thrive.
   Biosocial research epitomises this drive towards automation and
   totality, and, notwithstanding de Freitas' attempts to rescue it from
   the logic of control, I will argue that agent-centred intentions dismiss
   the underlying workings of capital as a real abstraction. I do so by
   engaging with elements of Deleuze's philosophy, showing how the more
   than human frame in which de Freitas' biosocial research rests
   contradicts her own perception of how biosocial research can be rescued
   for inclusive purposes.},

Abstract = {Although counting problems are easy to state and provide rich,
   accessible problem-solving situations, there is much evidence that
   students struggle with solving counting problems correctly. With
   combinatorics (and the study of counting problems) becoming increasingly
   prevalent in K-12 and undergraduate curricula, there is a need for
   researchers to identify potentially significant factors that might have
   an effect on student success as they solve counting problems. We tested
   one such factor among undergraduate students-their systematic listing of
   what they were trying to count. We argue that even creating partial
   lists of the set of outcomes led to significant improvements in
   performance in students' success on problems, implying that systematic
   listing may be worthwhile for students to engage in as they learn to
   count. Our findings suggest that more needs to be done to refine
   instructional interventions that facilitate listing. We discuss these
   findings and suggest avenues for further research.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {The literature on gestures describes how they often comprise iconic,
   deictic and metaphoric dimensions, but the interplay between these
   dimensions can be very subtle and nuanced. Due to the abstract nature of
   the subject, the use of gestures in the learning of mathematics means
   that the metaphoric dimension is often prominent. However, iconic and
   deictic gestures also play their part, and it has not been clear how the
   transition from gestures that have primarily iconic and deictic
   dimensions to those that are primarily metaphoric arises. In this paper,
   we consider three cases in an attempt to identify the emergence of the
   metaphoric dimension of gesture. The vignettes are analysed from
   semiotic and cognitive perspectives as we attempt to explain elements of
   the evolution by describing it in terms of McNeill's concept of a growth
   point. In each example, the results highlight the evolution from a
   grounded to a more abstract blending following the particular point at
   which a switch from an emphasis on the iconic/deictic to the metaphoric
   dimension occurs.},

Abstract = {The research is a study of the Husserlian approach to intuition,
   informed by Merleau-Ponty's theory of perception, in the case of a
   prospective teacher of mathematics. It explores the two major
   stages-categories of intuition, the essential relations between them,
   and their vital role in the emergence of empirical and abstract
   mathematical objects, as they are used by the student in order to
   conceptualise mathematical phenomena. The student's activity is analysed
   to its intuitive origins, and an intuition of essences manifests its
   significance for generalisations and insights for mathematical proofs.
   Through an in depth phenomenological data analysis, intuition is
   delineated as an essential mediator between the learner's world-as-lived
   and her objectification process. Finally, some implications for teaching
   and learning are suggested.},

Abstract = {Through examining a representative Chinese textbook series' presentation
   of the distributive property, this study explores how mathematics
   curriculum may structure representations in ways that facilitate the
   transition from concrete to abstract so as to support students' learning
   of mathematical principles. A total of 319 instances of the distributive
   property were identified. The representational transition among these
   instances was analyzed at three tiers: within one worked example, from
   the worked example to practice problems within one topic, and across
   multiple topics over grades. Findings revealed four features that
   facilitate the transition process in the Chinese textbook series. First,
   it situates initial learning in a word problem context, which serves as
   a starting point of the transition process. Second, it sets up abstract
   representations as an ultimate goal of the multi-tier transition
   process. Third, it incorporates problem variations with connections in
   carefully designed tasks that embody the same targeted principles.
   Fourth, it engages students in constant sense making of the transition
   process through various pedagogical supports. Implementations and future
   research directions are also discussed.},

Abstract = {We propose a framework for examining how teachers may support collective
   argumentation in secondary mathematics classrooms, including teachers'
   direct contributions to arguments, the kinds of questions teachers ask,
   and teachers' other supportive actions. We illustrate our framework with
   examples from episodes of collective argumentation occurring across 2
   days in a teacher's classroom. Following from these examples, we discuss
   how the framework can be used to examine mathematical aspects of
   conversations in mathematics classrooms. We propose that the framework
   is useful for investigating and possibly enhancing how teachers support
   students' reasoning and argumentation as fundamentally mathematical
   activities.},

   designed to meet the mathematical demands of the workplace, especially
   when those demands are safety-critical? We explore this question through

Abstract = {In this study we investigated the role of a dynamic online game on
   students' early algebra problem solving. In total 253 students from
   grades 4, 5, and 6 (10-12 years old) used the game at home to solve a
   sequence of early algebra problems consisting of contextual problems
   addressing covarying quantities. Special software monitored the
   students' online working when solving the problems. Before and after the
   intervention a paper-and-pencil test on early algebra was administered.
   The data analysis revealed that the online working contributed to the
   students' early algebra performance. There was a significant gain in
   performance across all grades. The highest effect was found in grade 6.
   Out of the three strategy profile clusters that could be distinguished
   in the whole sample, the cluster dominated by using extreme values and
   the cluster characterized by the trial-and-error strategy were most
   influential on the gain in early algebra performance. The students'
   level of online working, which was defined as a combination of online
   involvement and strategy use, appeared to have a marginally significant
   effect on the gain score for the total sample. Per grade there was no
   significant effect, yet the levels of online working were significantly
   related to grade. Free playing was mostly performed in grade 4, looking
   for answers in grade 5, and exploring relations slightly more in grades
   5 and 6. About 17 \% of the effect of grade on the gain score was
   mediated by the level of online working.},

Title = {Contradiction and conflict between `leading identities': becoming an

Abstract = {This paper builds on previous work (Black et al., Educational Studies in
   Mathematics 73(1):55-72, 2010) which developed the notion of a leading
   identity (derived from Leont'ev's concept of `leading activity') which,
   we argued, defined students' motive for studying during late
   adolescence. We presented two case studies of students in
   post-compulsory education (Mary and Lee) and highlighted how the concept
   of a leading identity might be relevant to understanding motivation in
   mathematics education and particularly the `exchange value' or `use
   value' of mathematics for these students. (Lee's identity was mediated
   by mathematics' potential exchange value in becoming a university
   student, and Mary's more by its perceived use value to her leading
   identity as an engineer.) In this paper, we follow up Mary's story as
   she progresses to university, and we see how she is now `led' by
   contradictory motives and identities: Mary's aspirations and decisions
   seem to be now as much related to her identity as a Muslim woman as to
   her identity as an engineer. Therefore, we argue that more than one
   identity/activity may be considered as `leading' at this point in
   time-e.g. work versus motherhood/parenting, for instance-and this raises
   conflicts and tensions. We conclude with a more reflexive account of
   leading identity which recognises the adolescent's developing awareness
   of self-an ongoing process of organisation as they experience
   contradictions in managing their education, work, domestic, community
   and other lives.},

Abstract = {Pupil voice is an emerging force for change and improvement in many UK
   schools, but what is not fully understood is how best to access pupil
   voice within the specific context of secondary mathematics departments.
   This paper presents a research project designed to use pupils as
   co-researchers in increasing knowledge about how to improve learning in
   mathematics. Pupils within the school were selected and trained as
   ``Ambassadors{''} to understand and disseminate innovative ways of
   learning mathematics into their school environment and to act to allow
   the voice of all the pupils in their year group to be heard. The project
   was intended both to raise the pupils' awareness of how learning
   mathematics could be different and to enable them to voice their newly
   informed opinions about how best they learned mathematics. The pupils'
   current feelings about the way that they were taught mathematics were
   explored, but the focus of the project was on enabling the pupils to
   make informed decisions about how they felt their learning could be
   improved. The pupils' awareness of different ways of learning
   mathematics was raised by introducing them to alternative teaching
   approaches. The data generated were initially analysed by the pupils
   themselves in order to inform their teachers about their views and
   subsequently constant comparison analysis resulted in the outcomes
   reported here. The outcomes indicate that the students could have an
   important role in enabling schools to develop their teaching and improve
   their pupils' mathematical learning when that voice is both informed and
   authorised.},

Abstract = {Children had to choose one of two urns-each comprising beads of winning
   and losing colours-from which to draw a winning bead. Three experiments,
   aimed at diagnosing rules of choice and designed without confounding
   possible rules with each other, were conducted. The level of arithmetic
   difficulty of the trials was controlled so as not to distort the effects
   of the constituent variables of proportion. Children aged 4 to 11 first
   chose by more winning elements and proceeded with age to choices by
   greater proportion of winning elements. There were some indications of
   intermediate choices by fewer losing elements and by greater difference
   between the two colours. Distinguishing correct choices from favourable
   draws, namely acknowledging the role of chance in producing the outcome
   and insisting on the right choice, grew with age. Children switched
   rather early from considering one dimension to two; they combined the
   quantities of winning and losing elements either additively by
   difference or, with age, mostly multiplicatively by proportion. Guided
   playful activities for young children, based on this research, are
   suggested for fostering acquisition of the basic constituents of the
   probability concept: uncertainty of outcome, quantification by
   proportion, and the reverse relation between the chances of
   complementary events.},

Abstract = {Inversion is a fundamental relational building block both within
   mathematics as the study of structures and within people's physical and
   social experience, linked to many other key elements such as
   equilibrium, invariance, reversal, compensation, symmetry, and balance.
   Within purely formal arithmetic, the inverse relationships between
   addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division, have
   important implications in relation to flexible and efficient
   computation, and for the assessment of students' conceptual
   understanding. It is suggested that the extensive research on arithmetic
   should be extended to take account of numerical domains beyond the
   natural numbers and of the difficulties students have in extending the
   meanings of operations to those of more general domains. When the range
   of situations modelled by the arithmetical operations is considered, the
   complexity of inverse relationships between operations, and the
   variability in the forms that these relationships take, become much
   greater. Finally, some comments are offered on the divergent goals and
   preoccupations of cognitive psychologists and mathematics educators as
   illuminated by research in this area.},

Abstract = {Drawing on data from interviews with mathematics faculty in three
   different types of undergraduate institutions and using Rabardel's model
   of instrument use (V,rillon \& Rabardel 1995), we describe three ways
   textbooks mediate college faculty work regarding instruction. The model
   anticipates epistemic and pragmatic mediations between the instructor
   and teaching, others, and self, with the textbook playing a significant
   role. We provide illustrations of each of these mediations as described
   by the participants. Pragmatic rather than epistemic mediations were
   more common. In addition, we found that the mediations seem largely
   dependent on instructors' categorical perceptions of their students,
   either as ``math students{''} or as ``undergraduate students{''}. These
   alternate perceptions resulted in different descriptions of schemas for
   using the textbook with each type of student. The analysis generates
   further questions for research regarding either a developmental
   component or a curricular component that could explain this
   categorization of students.},

Abstract = {Most research on gestures (especially in the field of Mathematics
   Education) has focused on gestures in communication with others. In
   contrast, here, we focus on gestures which are not directed at others,
   but which we assume accompany inner speech or embodied thought, such as
   the gesticulation one makes by touching one's fingers whilst silently
   counting; that is, whilst thinking, or communicating with oneself.
   Typically, these gestures are accompanied by eye gaze, which is detached
   from others who are present and turned either inwards or towards
   relevant artefacts present. Additionally, these gestures-whilst
   structurally similar-are much smaller than ``normal{''} gestures used in
   interpersonal communication, suggesting an attenuation parallel to that
   found in inner speech. These physical gestures are in effect
   objectifications for oneself, which we can interpret as a not-quite-yet
   ``underground{''} part of embodied thought. We suggest that they might
   be particularly vital for understanding the imagistic, visuospatial
   dimension of mathematics in general and fractions in particular.},

Abstract = {This article deals with the roles of variation problems ({''}one problem
   multiple solution{''} and ``one problem multiple changes{''}) as used in
   Chinese textbooks. It is argued that variation problems as an
   ``indigenous{''} Chinese practice aim to discern and to compare the
   invariant feature of the relationship among concepts and solutions. This
   practice also aims to provide opportunities for making connections,
   since comparison is considered the pre-condition to perceive the
   structures, dependencies, and relationships that may lead to
   mathematical abstraction. In the first part of the article, the
   ``indigenous{''} practice is discussed against its philosophical Daoism
   and Confucianism backgrounds. To grasp its distinctiveness, a comparison
   between Chinese and American textbooks is carried out. In the second
   part of the article, the focus is on the manner in which fraction
   division is articulated in an important Chinese textbook. A framework to
   understand variation practice is introduced and some educational
   implications are suggested.},

Title = {Truth and the renewal of knowledge: the case of mathematics education},

Abstract = {Mathematics education research must enable adjustment to new conditions.
   Yet such research is often conducted within familiar conceptualisations
   of teaching, of learning and of mathematics. It may be necessary to
   express ourselves in new ways if we are to change our practices
   successfully, and potential changes can be understood in many
   alternative, sometimes conflicting, ways. The paper argues that our
   entrapment in specific pedagogic forms of mathematical knowledge and the
   styles of teaching that go with them can constrain students' engagement
   with processes of cultural renewal and changes in the ways in which
   mathematics may be framed for new purposes, but there are some
   mathematical truths that survive the changing circumstances that require
   us to update our understandings of teaching and learning the subject. In
   meeting this challenge, Radford encountered a difficulty in framing
   notions of mathematical objectivity and truth commensurate with a
   cultural-historical perspective. Following Badiou, this paper
   distinguishes between objectivity, which is seen necessarily as a
   product of culturally generated knowledge, and truth, as glimpsed beyond
   the on-going attempt to fit a new language that never finally settles.
   Through this route, it is shown how Badiou's differentiation of
   knowledge and truth enables us to conjure more futuristic conceptions of
   mathematics education.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the sources that pre-service
   teachers (PSTs) use when they construct their self-efficacy beliefs and
   learning goals, which compose their motivational profiles. Pre-service
   elementary teachers (n=22) with different motivational profiles
   participated in narrative interviews designed to examine retrospectively
   their past experiences in mathematics and the effect of those
   experiences on their motivational profiles. Results reveal that
   participants relied on multiple sources to construct their efficacy
   beliefs and goals, including past performance, vicarious experiences,
   verbal persuasions, career goals, and the fit between participants'
   views of mathematics and the nature of mathematics in their classes.
   While some of these factors have been identified by previous research,
   the contribution of the current study is to extend this research to a
   new population and to elaborate on these factors. Results also help
   refine and extend our knowledge of PSTs' motivation and suggest ways
   that teacher educators could influence PSTs' motivational profiles.},

Abstract = {This study was designed to investigate preservice elementary school
   teachers' (PSTs') responses to written standard place-value-operation
   tasks (addition and subtraction). Previous research established that
   PSTs can often perform but not explain algorithms and provided a
   four-category framework for PSTs' conceptions, two correct and two
   incorrect. Previous findings are replicated for PSTs toward the end of
   their college careers, and two conceptions are further analyzed to yield
   three categories of incorrect views of regrouped digits: (a)
   consistently as 1 value (all as 1 or all as 10), (b) consistently within
   but not across contexts (i.e., all as 10 in addition but all as 1 in
   subtraction), and (c) inconsistently (depending on the task).},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the role of tools in the formation of
   mathematical practices and the construction of mathematical meanings in
   the setting of a telecommunication organization through the actions
   undertaken by a group of technicians in their working activity. The
   theoretical and analytical framework is guided by the first-generation
   activity theory model and Leont'ev's work on the three-tiered
   explanation of activity. Having conducted a 1-year ethnographic research
   study, we identified, classified, and correlated the tools that mediated
   the technicians' activity, and we studied the mathematical meanings that
   emerged. A systemic network was generated, presenting the categories of
   tools such as mathematical (communicative, processes, and concepts) and
   non-mathematical (physical and written texts). This classification was
   grounded on data from three central actions of the technicians'
   activity, while the constant interrelation and association of these
   tools during the working process addressed the mathematical practices
   and supported the construction of mathematical meanings that this group
   developed from the researchers' perspective. Technicians' emerging
   mathematical meanings referred to place value, spatial, and algebraic
   relations and were expressed through personal algorithms and
   metaphorical and metonymic reasoning. Finally, the educational
   implications of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {Understanding that mathematics is founded on reasoning and is not just a
   collection of rules to apply is an important message to convey to
   students. Here we examined the reasoning presented in seven topics in
   nine Australian eighth-grade textbooks. Focusing on explanatory text
   that introduced new mathematical rules or relationships, we classified
   explanations according to the mode of reasoning used. Seven modes were
   identified, making a classification scheme which both refined and
   extended previous schemes. Most textbooks provided explanations for most
   topics rather than presenting ``rules without reasons{''} but the main
   purpose appeared to be rule derivation or justification in preparation
   for practise exercises, rather than using explanations as thinking
   tools. Textbooks generally did not distinguish between the legitimacies
   of deductive and other modes of reasoning.},

Title = {Racialization through coloniality in mathematics curricula:
   problematizing the Cambridge Assessment International Examination in
   Sub-Saharan Africa},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 20},
Abstract = {In this essay, I examine coloniality as a racializing force within
   international education curricula. I focus on the British-developed
   Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE) curriculum,
   previously known as the Cambridge International Education (CIE)
   curriculum. Using the CAIE as a specific case, I discuss how
   international curricula serve as vehicles of coloniality and
   simultaneously reproduce racialized narratives about Sub-Saharan
   Africans. The persistence of CAIE is implicated in the ongoing project
   of coloniality, sustaining and reproducing racial hierarchies and the
   marginalization of Sub-Saharan African communities. I contend that CAIE
   privileges a singular way of thinking and being in mathematics and uses
   assessment practices to perpetuate coloniality. By recognizing the ways
   in which coloniality and racialization are interconnected, we can better
   understand the complex systems of power and privilege that shape
   international mathematics curricula.},

Title = {Conceptions of span in linear algebra: from textbook examples to student
   responses},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 4},
Abstract = {Using Balacheff's (2013) model of conceptions, we inferred potential
   conceptions in three examples presented in the spanning sets section of
   an interactive linear algebra textbook. An analysis of student responses
   to two similar reading questions revealed additional strategies that
   students used to decide whether a vector was in the spanning set of a
   given set of vectors. An analysis of the correctness of the application
   of these strategies provides a more nuanced understanding of student
   responses that might be more useful for instructors than simply
   classifying the responses as right or wrong. These findings add to our
   knowledge of the textbook's presentation of span and student
   understanding of span. We discuss implications for research and
   practice.},

Title = {Using positioning theory to think about mathematics classroom talk},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 20},
Abstract = {This article aims to connect two research areas by using positioning
   theory to review the literature on talk moves, teacher interactions, and
   discourse patterns in mathematics education. First, a conceptual review
   identified 44 articles with 94 concepts describing interactions and
   discourse patterns. Similar concepts were grouped in a process that
   developed five categories, each describing one teacher position (a
   teacher who tells, a teacher who supports, a teacher who uses students'
   ideas to create learning, a teacher who orchestrates, and a teacher who
   participates). Related to each position, we describe rights, duties, and
   communication acts. We suggest that these five teacher positions
   represent three transcendent storylines (teachers are providers of
   insight, teachers are facilitators of learning, and teachers are
   participants in learning). Using positioning theory enables us to
   understand the underlying powers that shape the classroom in relation to
   transcendent storylines, rights, and duties. We use this to explore what
   the implications are of these storylines and positions for equity and
   access to important mathematical ideas. This article contributes to our
   understanding of the complexity of classroom interactions and how
   transcendent storylines might play a role in subverting or promoting
   particular classroom communication patterns.},

Title = {``You can't just check the box{''}: the mathematics of ethnoracial
   contortions at a California high school},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 7},
Abstract = {This article brings critical and postcolonial theories together with
   extended ethnographic research in a predominantly Latinx high school in
   California's ``South Bay{''} to theorize the co-production and
   co-naturalization of mathematical and racial essentialization. Analysis
   of vignettes and interview excerpts illuminates both student uptake and
   resistance to homogenizing narratives of mathematics and racial
   personhood. Student voices from Sierra High School both evidenced the
   existence, stakes, and personal consequences of narrowly bounded, taken
   for granted, conceptions of mathematics and racial personhood and
   challenged these homogenizing categories. This paper contributes theory
   illuminating the co-construction of mathematical and racial
   essentialization along with examples of local critique and resistance
   from youth and their adult allies at one high school in the USA.
   Implications suggest that decolonial work in mathematics education must
   jointly address the narrow and essentializing frames for race and
   racialization and for mathematics itself as co-producing and
   co-naturalizing each other. This study contributes insight into
   mechanisms that perpetuate and also resist or disrupt these processes.},

Abstract = {Public media both reflects and shapes societal perceptions and
   attitudes. Teachers and others around students in mathematics classrooms
   have expectations for the students, projected with what appears in these
   media. We are most concerned about the expectations placed on students
   who are identified with minoritized groups-particularly students who are
   Indigenous or migrated to Norway. We investigate how minoritized group
   contexts and mathematics education appear together in Norwegian news
   media texts. Our analysis uses the notion of storylines to describe the
   expectations about minoritized groups that news media project. We found
   seven entangled storylines: ``the majority language and culture are keys
   to learning and knowing mathematics,{''} ``mathematics is language- and
   culture-neutral,{''} ``minoritized groups' mathematics achievements are
   linked to culture and gender,{''} ``extraordinary measures are needed to
   teach students from minoritized groups mathematics,{''} ``students from
   minoritized groups underachieve,{''} ``students from minoritized groups
   put in extraordinary effort and time to learn mathematics,{''} and
   ``minoritized mathematics students are motivated by gratitude.{''}},

Title = {When is less more? Investigating gap-filling in proofs without words
   activities},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {111},

Abstract = {In activities based on proof without words (PWW), we developed, students
   are given a PWW- a diagram that alludes to the proof of a mathematical
   theorem. The students work collaboratively to construct a proof alluded
   by the PWW, and then each student writes and submits a proof attempt. In
   a 3-year design-based study, we investigate and develop PWW-based
   activities for advancing upper secondary students' proficiency in
   constructing proofs. We use the concept of gap-filling as a theoretical
   framework. In a nutshell, gap-filling is an action of adding information
   absent in a text that a reader does for sense-making. We inquire whether
   secondary school students independently construct a proof when a PWW is
   at their disposal, what characterizes those gaps that students identify
   and fill, and how PWW design principles influence students' gap-filling.
   We identified four categories of gaps: key idea, generality,
   constructional, and figure property justifications. We find that
   students mainly fill key idea gaps but not generality gaps and that PWWs
   that presented the construction procedure led more students to fill the
   constructional gaps. However, PWWs that did not explicitly present some
   figures' property led more students to fill those justification gaps. We
   identify five PWW design principles that can enhance secondary students'
   gap-filling and conclude that a meticulous design paves the way to
   implement PWW-based activities for fostering mathematical proving.},

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {To increase possibilities for listening respectfully to Indigenous
   educators, there is a need to identify conversational prompts which are
   used to raise alternative views of social justice about mathematics
   education for Indigenous students. Using Nancy Fraser's description of
   abnormal social justice, an analysis was made of transcripts from round
   table sessions, at an Indigenous mathematics education conference. This
   analysis identified a number of conversational prompts that enabled
   shifts from normal to abnormal discussions about social justice. Normal
   discussions exhibited assumptions in which mathematics was valued as a
   Western domain of knowledge; cultural examples could be used as vehicles
   to teach mathematics; and decisions about education for Indigenous
   students should be made by external authorities. In abnormal
   discussions, these assumptions were queried and alternative
   possibilities arose. The conversational prompts, which initiated this
   querying, occurred in a number of ways, including the telling of stories
   and the asking of questions that either directly or indirectly
   challenged normal justice discourses about Indigenous students' learning
   of mathematics. Identifying conversational prompts can assist
   non-Indigenous mathematics educators, who wish to be allies, to
   challenge their own and others' assumptions about normal social justice
   issues related to mathematics education for Indigenous students.},

Abstract = {How can school mathematics prepare citizens for a democratic society?
   Answers to this question are not static; they change as society and its
   problems change. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with its corresponding disease
   COVID-19 presents such a problem: what is needed to navigate this
   complex situation that involves, among other things, mathematics? Using
   the essay genre, we use three narratives from three countries-Italy, the
   USA (California), and Germany-to reflect on the goals of teaching
   mathematics during this crisis and examine aspects of each country's
   standards for mathematics education. These three stories are framed by
   the authors' backgrounds, experiences, interests, their country's
   situation, and response to the pandemic. We first present the three
   narratives and then examine common issues across them that might provide
   insights beyond this current crisis, for preparing students to become
   active citizens. In particular, we focus on three issues: (1) developing
   a positive mindset toward mathematics to engage with and reflect on
   real-world problems, (2) improving interdisciplinary connections to the
   sciences to better understand how science professional practices and
   insights are similar or different from everyday practices, and (3)
   considering interpersonal and collective matters beyond the individual.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on adults who are neither preschool teachers nor
   professional caregivers and investigates their beliefs regarding the
   importance of engaging young children with numerical activities. It also
   examines the types of numerical activities adults report having observed
   children engaging with, as well as the types of activities they propose
   as a way for promoting counting, enumerating, recognizing number
   symbols, and number composition and decomposition. Findings showed that
   participants believed to a great extent that engaging young children
   with numerical activities is important. Most reported that they had
   observed children engaging with at least some numerical activity. In
   general, participants relayed more activities and more detailed
   activities when suggesting activities for each competency, than they did
   when reporting observed activities. Findings also suggested a need to
   enhance adults' knowledge regarding the necessity to promote verbal
   counting, separate from object counting, as well as to increase adults'
   awareness of number composition and decomposition. For mathematics
   educators wishing to plan workshops for adults, this study offers a
   method for investigating adults' knowledge of early numerical
   activities, as well as a starting point with which to plan appropriate
   workshops.},

Abstract = {Historic achievement gaps in mathematics favoring male students have
   recently started to narrow, close, or even shift in favor of female
   students. Still, in many countries, male students continue to outperform
   their female counterparts in international mathematics assessments.
   Chile has one of the highest mathematics achievement gaps in the world,
   as shown by international assessment tests, with males outperforming
   females. Using nationally representative longitudinal data and
   multigroup latent growth modeling (LGM), the purpose of this study was
   to track the gender scoring gap in mathematics from kindergarten to
   grade 12. Findings showed gender differences emerged during preschool
   and increasingly widened as students progressed through school. Although
   the gap subsided slightly between grades 10 and 12, the initial gap
   almost doubled by the end of high school, with important implications
   for access to higher education and choice of major.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on students' mathematical discourse emerging from
   interactions in the digital environment GeoGebra, in which one can
   construct virtual objects that realize mathematical signifiers and then
   interact with them. These virtual object realizations can become dynamic
   interactive mediators (DIMs) that influence the development of the
   learners' mathematical discourse. In this case study, I analyze in fine
   detail the discourse developed by two dyads of students in response to
   an unfamiliar interview question. One dyad came from a class in which
   GeoGebra was not part of classroom practice and included students who,
   according to the teacher's evaluation, were standard-to-high achieving.
   The other dyad was from a generally demotivated and low-achieving class
   in which GeoGebra had become part of classroom practice. The analyses,
   focused especially on the low-achieving dyad, are guided by the question
   of how DIMs shaped these students' discourse. According to the analysis,
   these students ended up succeeding where standard-to-high-achieving
   peers did not. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the ways in which the
   DIMs supported this dyad's learning showed mechanisms that may be
   general rather than specific to this one case. This suggests that
   appropriate integration of DIMs into the teaching and learning of high
   school algebra can be beneficial for low-achieving students.},

Abstract = {This manuscript focuses on how students make sense of proofs.
   Participants were students who engaged in peer-review conferences of
   each other's attempted proofs in a graduate-level real analysis course
   for mathematics teachers. Building on the concept of distance from
   conversational analysis, we distinguish how three types of distance
   (epistemic, rhetorical, and ontological) between a student and a
   particular claim influence sensemaking. This article also explores the
   impact of students' sensemaking on their perceptions of proof.},

Abstract = {Educators in mathematics have long been concerned about students'
   motivation, anxiety, and other affective characteristics. Typically,
   research into affect focuses on one theoretical construct (e.g.,
   emotion, motivation, beliefs, or interest). However, we introduce the
   termaffective fieldto account for a person's various affective factors
   (emotions, attitudes, etc.) in their intraplay. In a case study, we use
   data from an extracurricular, inquiry-oriented collaborative problem
   posing and problem solving (PP\&PS) program, which took place as a
   1-year project with four upper secondary school students in Sweden (aged
   16-18). We investigated the affective field of one student, Anna, in its
   social and dynamic nature. The question addressed in this context is:In
   what ways does an affective field of a student engaging in PP\&PS
   evolve, and what may be explanations for this evolvement?Anna's
   affective field was dynamic over the course of the program. Her initial
   anxiety during the PP\&PS program was rooted in her prior affective
   field about mathematics activities, but group collaboration, the feeling
   of safety and appreciation, together with an increased interest in
   within-solution PP and openness for trying new things went hand in hand
   with positive dynamics in her affective field.},

Abstract = {The question of teaching a standard written algorithm for the four
   arithmetical operations in the first years of elementary school is
   increasingly raised as a consequence of the possibility of using
   calculators, tablets, and computers. This article first presents
   arguments both against and for maintaining this teaching in the first
   school years. Then, it presents an analysis of the procedurewhether it
   implies the standard algorithm or notused by second grade students to
   solve a subtraction verbal problem. The 4720 students involved in the
   research were divided in a control group (n=2101) and an experimental
   group (n=2619) in which the standard written algorithm (SWA) was taught,
   or not taught, respectively. The effectiveness of algorithm use was
   analyzed not only in terms of accuracy of the answers, but also for its
   influence on the choice of the correct arithmetical operation and for
   its choice by the students as a function of their ability. The SWA was
   strongly associated with the use of the false arithmetical operation
   (effect size phi=0.79)addition instead of subtractionbut was chosen by
   students of all levels of ability. The latter result suggests that the
   SWA is well suited for the most advanced students but far less for the
   others who use it mechanically and without reflection.},

Abstract = {The paper describes two versions of an inquiry-based activity in
   geometry, designed as a game between two players. The game is inspired
   by Hintikka's semantic game, which is a familiar tool in the field of
   logic to define truth. The activity is designed in a dynamic geometry
   environment (DGE). The inquiry is initially guided by the game itself
   and later by a questionnaire that helps students discover the geometry
   theorem behind the game. The activity is emblematic of describing a
   geometry-based inquiry that can be implemented with various Euclidean
   geometry theorems. The analysis of the first student vs. student version
   associates the example space produced by the students with their
   dialogue, to identify the different functions of variation. Based on the
   results of this version, we designed a student vs. computer version and
   created filters for the automatic analysis of the players' moves. Our
   findings show that students who participated in the activity developed
   forms of strategic reasoning that helped them discover the winning
   configuration, formulate if-then statements, and validate or refute
   conjectures. Automation of the analysis creates new research
   opportunities for analyzing and assessing students' inquiry processes
   and makes possible extensive experimentation on inquiry-based knowledge
   acquisition.},

Abstract = {Part of the international reflection on the use of history in
   mathematics teaching consists in a quest of frameworks and models
   suitable for empirical studies. Following this demand, this paper
   explores the way Balacheff's cKE 1/4 model, a model taken from the
   didactics of mathematics, can be used in the analysis of learning at
   student level. In the first part of this paper, Balacheff's cKE 1/4
   model (conceptions, knowledge, E 1/4 oncepts) is shortly presented, and
   in the second part, the relationship between the epistemological
   background of the model and the use of the history of mathematics is
   explored in order to show a possible suitableness. The third part
   addresses an example of a school activity (about ancient Indian
   geometry) in which the model is applied and the historical issues
   clarified. Questioning the role of problems both in the cKE 1/4 model
   and in the use of history, the last part shows how a study at the
   students' conception level enlightens the way in which historical
   elements can interact with contemporary mathematical learning.},

Abstract = {This study explored the perspectives of mathematics teacher
   educator-researchers (MTE-Rs) on the use of theory in facilitating
   teacher growth. We adopted the framework of the theory-centered
   scholarship triangle (Silver \& Herbst, 2007) to probe the underlying
   meanings of perspectives on theory use expressed by MTE-Rs. Qualitative
   analysis revealed three distinct types of perspectives: a perspective
   focusing on research, a perspective focusing on practice, and a
   perspective on the connection between research and practice. For the
   perspective on the connection between research and practice, two
   sub-categories were identified: connection with consideration of context
   and that without consideration of context. Different perspectives that
   MTE-Rs possess may influence their actions taken in professional
   development and consequently influence teachers' learning of theory.
   Specifically, the cyclic process of decontextualizing and
   recontextualizing theory between research and practice domains is the
   key to the development of MTE-Rs' educative power so that they can
   better facilitate teachers in learning theory.},

Abstract = {One major obstacle for integrating the history of mathematics in
   teaching (hereafter referred to as IHT) is how to help teachers,
   particularly those who lack experience in IHT, use historical materials
   in their teaching. Based on many IHT practices in Shanghai, this paper
   proposes an IHT framework including two parts: one is a triangular
   pyramid IHT model, and the other is a design-based IHT procedure. The
   pyramid model is composed of three different communities: teachers,
   researchers, and historians of mathematics. The design-based procedure,
   also called operating model, includes cyclic stages, which are
   investigation, design, implementation, assessment, and publication. The
   primary purpose of this framework is to build a bridge between theory
   and practice by combining the two models to address particular teaching
   concerns and improve teaching. In addition, this paper details the
   process of the dynamic pyramid model and the design-based IHT procedure,
   and illustrates an example of the application of this framework.
   Finally, this paper discusses the differences and similarities between
   this model and others and also discusses the challenge of applying this
   model in practice.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the competence of Cultural (epistemological,
   historical and anthropological) Analysis of the Content (CAC), which is
   important for teachers' awareness and autonomy when dealing with
   educational choices in a changing cultural and institutional context. We
   report on an 18-hour intervention in a teacher education course at the
   undergraduate level attended by 12 participants during the fall of 2013.
   The goal of the intervention was to enhance participants' CAC in the
   case of Elementary Arithmetic Theorems by using the rationality
   construct derived from Habermas' work. Qualitative analyses of
   participants' discussions showed how the construct was gradually
   appropriated by them and contributed to their CAC. Trends emerging from
   quantitative comparisons with previous implementations of the same
   course provided some evidence regarding the effects of the intervention
   on the quality of participants' CAC performances at the end of the
   course. The method chosen for participants' assessment and their
   cultural background will be discussed as conditions for the success of
   the intervention.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the issue of transition from secondary to
   post-secondary education through collaborative research with teachers
   from both levels. It takes into account implicit elements in this
   transition. Research on the transition in mathematics education tends to
   focus more on the tertiary level, studying difficulties encountered by
   students or comparing curricula, tasks, and textbooks highlighting
   disruptions or cultural shifts. However, according to Hall (1959), and
   Artigue (2004) in a mathematical context, it is the implicit ``ways of
   doing{''} that lead to the greatest cultural differences. In this
   article, attention is paid to the particular ways in which teachers'
   ways of doing mathematics impact the transition. Ethnomethodology
   (Garfinkel, 1967) and its central concept of ethnomethods are used as
   the theoretical framework to conceptualize these ways of doing
   mathematics. A breaching situation presented to a group of secondary-and
   tertiary-level teachers engaged in collaborative research (Desgagne et
   al., 2001) brings to light familiar ways of doing mathematics. Our
   analysis focuses specifically on a comparison of the ways of doing
   mathematics related to functions at each level.},

Abstract = {The process of proofs and refutations described by Lakatos is essential
   in school mathematics to provide students with an opportunity to
   experience how mathematical knowledge develops dynamically within the
   discipline of mathematics. In this paper, a framework for describing
   student processes of proofs and refutations is constructed using a set
   of heuristic rules formulated by Lakatos. A salient feature of this
   framework resides in the notion of increasing content by deductive
   guessing, which Lakatos considered to be one of the cores of proofs and
   refutations, where deductive reasoning is used to create a general
   conjecture that is true even for counterexamples of an earlier
   conjecture. Two case studies involving a pair of fifth graders and a
   pair of ninth graders are presented to illustrate that the notion of
   increasing content by deductive guessing is useful in examining student
   processes of generalisation of conjectures. The framework shown in this
   paper contributes to the current knowledge of mathematics education
   researchers about proof and proving by providing a tool to investigate
   how a proof can be used not only to establish the truth of a given
   statement but also to generate new mathematical knowledge.},

Abstract = {Socio-political studies in mathematics education often touch complex
   fields of interaction between education, mathematics and the political.
   In this paper I present a Foucault-based framework for socio-political
   studies in mathematics education which may guide research in that area.
   In order to show the potential of such a framework, I discuss the
   potential and limits of Marxian ideology critique, present existing
   Foucault-based research on socio-political aspects of mathematics
   education, develop my framework and show its use in an outline of a
   study on socio-political aspects of calculation in the mathematics
   classroom.},

Abstract = {Prompting students to construct multiple solutions for modelling
   problems with vague conditions has been found to be an effective way to
   improve students' performance on interest-oriented measures. In the
   current study, we investigated the influence of this teaching element on
   students' performance. To assess the impact of prompting multiple
   solutions in mathematics instruction compared with the prompting of a
   single solution, we conducted an experimental study with 144 ninth
   graders from six German classes from middle track schools. We had two
   experimental groups: In one experimental group, students were required
   to provide two solutions for modelling problems related to the topic of
   Pythagoras' theorem; in the other group, they were asked to find one
   solution for each problem. Students' performance in solving tasks with
   and without a connection to the real world was assessed before and after
   a five-lesson teaching unit. In addition, the number of solutions
   developed and students' experience of competence were assessed with a
   questionnaire during the teaching unit. The findings showed that,
   similar to previous studies, prompting students to find multiple
   solutions does not improve their performance directly. However, using
   path analysis, we found indirect effects of the treatment on students'
   performance via the number of solutions they developed and their
   experience of competence.},

Abstract = {A challenge in mathematics education research is to coordinate different
   analyses to develop a more comprehensive account of teaching and
   learning. We contribute to these efforts by expanding the constructs in
   Cobb and Yackel's (Educational Psychologist 31:175-190, 1996)
   interpretive framework that allow for coordinating social and individual
   perspectives. This expansion involves four different constructs:
   disciplinary practices, classroom mathematical practices, individual
   participation in mathematical activity, and mathematical conceptions
   that individuals bring to bear in their mathematical work. We illustrate
   these four constructs for making sense of students' mathematical
   progress using data from an undergraduate mathematics course in linear
   algebra.},

Abstract = {We adopt a neo-Vygotskian view that a fully concrete scientific concept
   can only emerge from engaging in practice with systems of theoretical
   concepts, such as when mathematics is used to make sense of outside
   school or vocational practices. From this perspective, the literature on
   mathematics outside school tends to dichotomise in- and out-of-school
   practice and glamorises the latter as more authentic and situated than
   academic mathematics. We then examine case study ethnographies of
   mathematics in which this picture seemed to break down in moments of
   mathematical problem solving and modelling in practice: (1) when amateur
   or professional players decided to investigate the mathematics of darts
   scoring to develop their ``outing{''} strategies and (2) when a
   prevocational mathematics course task challenged would-be mathematics
   teachers' concept of fractions. These examples are used to develop the
   Vygotskian framework in relation to vocational and workplace
   mathematics. Finally, we propose that a unified view of mathematics,
   outside and inside school, on the basis of Vygotsky's approach to
   everyday and scientific thought, can usefully orientate further research
   in vocational mathematics education.},

Abstract = {This study investigates early childhood prospective teachers' attention
   to geometrical tasks while designing and using them in the classroom.
   This is explored in the context of the teaching practice of 11
   prospective teachers who taught geometry in early childhood classrooms
   during the last semester of their university studies. The teaching
   practice was organized into four stages: design of a lesson plan;
   classroom implementation; discussion of the lesson with the school
   practice instructor; and self-assessment report and revision of the
   lesson. Analysis of data using the Teaching Triad framework (Jaworski,
   1994) shows that although the prospective teachers attended to issues of
   mathematical challenge, sensitivity to students, and management of
   learning in their planning, in their actual teaching and after class
   reflection, their attention was focused mainly on management issues. The
   findings also show that prospective teachers' attention on geometrical
   tasks can be developed through a process of reflection on their
   teaching.},

Abstract = {In this article of the special issue devoted to the European project
   ReMath, we present and discuss the affordances of this project in terms
   of networking between theoretical frameworks. After clarifying the
   vision of theories and networking adopted in this project, we introduce
   the methodological constructs that have been developed and used in
   ReMath for performing the planned networking enterprise. We then present
   its outcomes, focusing on different facets of this networking activity:
   the identification of possible connections and complementarities between
   frameworks, the identification and elaboration of boundary objects
   between cultures, and the progressive building of a shared theoretical
   framework regarding semiotic representations. In the last part of this
   article, we review the whole networking enterprise from the perspective
   of research praxeology.},

Title = {Towards a theory of mathematics homework as a social practice},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Number = {3},
Pages = {371-391},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article presents a theoretical conceptualization of mathematics
   homework as a social practice. Rather than considering homework as a
   task or an artifact, this approach frames homework in terms of the
   social contexts in which students participate and how students
   participate in those contexts. This perspective has long been suggested
   by homework researchers but has not been developed as a framework for
   understanding homework. Drawing from Wenger's (1998) social theory of
   learning and research grounded in sociocultural theory, this
   conceptualization makes central meaning making and identity development,
   and puts forth meaning and identity as lenses for understanding
   students' participation in the practice of mathematics homework. To
   further develop this conceptualization of homework, I draw on data from
   an ethnographic study of the role and meaning of mathematics homework in
   the lives of middle school students. Case studies of two students are
   presented to demonstrate the relationships among the meaning of
   homework, students' identities, and their participation in the practice
   of homework. One student's experiences support him in identifying as a
   capable mathematics student who is bound for continued academic success
   through high school to college. Thus, he comes to take on mathematics
   homework as a means to learn and succeed. The other student's
   experiences support him in building an identity that leads him to reject
   homework. This conceptualization of homework and the case study data
   have implications for the practice of homework and for theories of
   students' motivational dispositions in the context of mathematics
   homework and learning in general.},

Abstract = {Interpreting and responding to student thinking are central tasks of
   reform-minded mathematics teaching. This study examined preservice
   teachers' (PSTs) interpretations of and responses to a student's
   error(s) involving finding a missing length in similar rectangles
   through a teaching scenario task. Fifty-seven PSTs' responses were
   analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Analysis results revealed
   that although the student's errors came from conceptual aspects of
   similarity, a majority of PSTs identified the errors as stemming from
   procedural aspects of similarity, subsequently guiding them by invoking
   procedural knowledge. This study also revealed two different forms of
   address and teaching actions in PST interventions along with three
   categories of acts of communication barriers. The broader implications
   of the study for international communities are discussed in accordance
   with the findings.},

Abstract = {Although official curriculum documents make cursory mention of the need
   for problem posing in school mathematics, problem posing rarely becomes
   part of the implemented or assessed curriculum. This paper provides
   examples of how problem posing can be made an integral part of
   mathematics teacher education programs. It is argued that such programs
   are a good place to start the process of redesigning mathematics
   curricula so that school mathematics will pay more than lip service to
   problem posing. Data are presented and analyzed showing that teacher
   education students can recognize the need for problem posing both in
   their own programs and in school mathematics curricula. Examples of
   problems posed by teacher education students are presented and
   discussed. An active learning framework for interpreting the role of
   problem posing in mathematics classrooms is presented.},

Abstract = {In this article, I deconstruct the concept of understanding in
   mathematics education, examining how it is spoken into being and what
   work it does for primary school student teachers. I use poststructural
   analysis to unpack interviews with a student teacher, Jane, drawn from a
   larger longitudinal study. I show how she negotiates tensions between
   ``romantic{''} discourses of understanding within mathematics education
   research and ``functional{''} discourses of understanding within
   neoliberal mathematics education policy. A romantic discourse constructs
   understanding as an aspect of being resulting from the natural curiosity
   of the child. A functional discourse constructs understanding as
   performances within which the child is indistinguishable from automata.
   I argue that Jane takes on both functionality and romanticism, but they
   collide creating a disorderly discourse of understanding that reproduces
   inequity.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of an academic music intervention on
   conceptual understanding of music notation, fraction symbols, fraction
   size, and equivalency of third graders from a multicultural, mixed
   socio-economic public school setting. Students (N = 67) were assigned by
   class to their general education mathematics program or to receive
   academic music instruction two times/week, 45 min/session, for 6 weeks.
   Academic music students used their conceptual understanding of music and
   fraction concepts to inform their solutions to fraction computation
   problems. Linear regression and t tests revealed statistically
   significant differences between experimental and comparison students'
   music and fraction concepts, and fraction computation at posttest with
   large effect sizes. Students who came to instruction with less fraction
   knowledge responded well to instruction and produced posttest scores
   similar to their higher achieving peers.},

Abstract = {This study examines patterns in middle-grade boys' and girls' written
   problem solving strategies for a mathematical task involving
   proportional reasoning. The students participating in this study attend
   a coeducational charter middle school with single-sex classrooms. One
   hundred nineteen sixth-grade students' responses are analyzed by gender
   according to the solution strategy they used to arrive at their final
   response to the task. The categories of solution strategies include
   non-response, purely additive, purely procedural, transition, novice,
   and mature. The proportions of girls and boys classified as mature in
   their strategies were essentially equal. However, more than half of
   girls' responses were considered purely procedural or purely additive-a
   proportion double that of boys thus classified.},

Abstract = {In the attempt to improve mathematical thinking for safeguarding our
   future societal needs, there is a worldwide tendency in schools to start
   training mathematical and arithmetical operations at an earlier age in
   children's development. Recent theoretical developments and empirical
   research have pointed to alternative ways of approaching early
   mathematical thinking. In these latter approaches, mathematical
   development in the early developmental stages is seen as an emerging
   process in the context of children's own activities that contributes to
   meaningful learning and stimulation of children's cultural identity
   (Bildung approach). The discussion between the training approach versus
   the `Bildung' approach is still intemperately going on. In this article,
   some outcomes of a research programme (based at the Free University
   Amsterdam) are discussed that present empirical studies and their
   theoretical background (cultural-historical theory, elaborated in an
   educational concept called `Developmental Education') that demonstrates
   the promising potentials of promoting mathematical thinking through
   supporting young children's appropriation of schematic representations
   and notations in the context of play.},

Volume = {74},

Pages = {39-51},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Drawing on results from psychology and from cultural and linguistic
   studies, we argue for an increased focus on developing quantity sense in
   school mathematics. We explore the notion of ``feeling number{''}, a
   phrase that we offer in a twofold sense-resisting tendencies to feel
   numb-er (more numb) by developing a feeling for numbers and the
   quantities they represent. First, we distinguish between quantity sense
   and the relatively vague notion of number sense. Second, we consider the
   human capacity for quantity sense and place that in the context of
   related cultural issues, including verbal and symbolic representations
   of number. Third and more pragmatically, we offer teaching strategies
   that seem helpful in the development of quantity sense coupled with
   number sense. Finally, we argue that there is a moral imperative to
   connect number sense with such a quantity sense that allows students to
   feel the weight of numbers. It is important that learners develop a
   feeling for number, which includes a sense of what numbers are and what
   they can do.},

Abstract = {Teachers in the UK and elsewhere are now expected to foster creativity
   in young children (NACCCE, 1999; Ofsted, 2003; DfES, 2003; DfES/DCMS,
   2006). Creativity, however, is more often associated with the arts than
   with mathematics. The aim of the study was to explore and document
   pre-service (in the UK, pre-service teachers are referred to as
   `trainee' teachers) primary teachers' conceptions of creativity in
   mathematics teaching in the UK. A questionnaire probed their conceptions
   early in their course, and these were supplemented with data from
   semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the responses indicated that
   pre-service teachers' conceptions were narrow, predominantly associated
   with the use of resources and technology and bound up with the idea of
   ;teaching creatively' rather than `teaching for creativity'. Conceptions
   became less narrow as pre-service teachers were preparing to enter
   schools as newly qualified, but they still had difficulty in identifying
   ways of encouraging and assessing creativity in the classroom. This
   difficulty suggests that conceptions of creativity need to be addressed
   and developed directly during pre-service education if teachers are to
   meet the expectations of government as set out in the above documents.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze and compare two didactical designs for
   introducing primary school pupils to proportional reasoning in the
   context of plane polygons. One of them is well-documented in the
   literature; the other one is based on our own data and is accordingly
   presented and discussed in more detail in this paper. The two designs
   come from different cultural and intellectual environments: lesson study
   in Japan (implicitly based on the ``open approach method{''}) and
   ``didactical engineering{''} in France (based on the theory of
   didactical situations). The general aim of our paper is to compare these
   two environments and their approaches to didactical design, basing our
   discussion on the concrete designs mentioned above. Clear differences
   among them are presented, while we also identify links which hold
   potential for integrating research and practice.},

Title = {Interrogating the equity promise for Black immigrant students in
   reformed mathematics classrooms},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 1},
Abstract = {As increasing numbers of Black immigrant students attend schools in
   Chile, we examine classroom practices to consider the limits of the
   mathematics education equity promise for this student population. We
   focus on the practices of a third-grade teacher who participated in
   professional development for enhancing reform-based mathematics teaching
   in a racially diverse classroom. Drawing on Stuart Hall's approach to
   race, our analysis shows how two technologies of race-power fabricate
   the Black immigrant child as an uneducable and impossible mathematics
   learner. We contend that rather than enhancing the inclusion of Black
   immigrant students, reform-based mathematics teaching might maintain and
   reinforce racial hierarchies of mathematics ability.},

Title = {Unpacking discourses about the transition from school to university
   mathematics: an intensive reading},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 7},
Abstract = {This paper has two main goals: first, to analyze current research
   related with transition to identify the foci being produced and
   reproduced by research through a literature review and, second, to map
   the connections between circulating discourses to unfold the discursive
   network that supports them via an intensive reading. Specifically, we
   are interested in how social and economic factors, educational
   background, and cognitive development impact the transition process and
   the documented potential challenges students may face. In this fashion,
   the questions that guide the development of the paper are as follows:
   What are the dominant narratives in mathematics education research about
   the transition from school to university mathematics? How do dominant
   narratives entangle particular rationalities to configure a discursive
   network about the transition from school to university mathematics? As a
   result, we identify three dominant narratives entangled, which shape a
   system of reason that regulates what is possible to do, act, and think.},

Abstract = {Coordination of theoretical probability and relative frequency estimates
   is challenging in probability teaching and learning. Modeling is one of
   the ways of teaching and learning that facilitates inquiry between these
   two perspectives. Given that, we designed a modeling activity to support
   fifteen secondary students in investigating theoretical probabilities,
   relative frequencies, and the corresponding relationship and in
   estimating the true probability. We analyzed how the design of a
   modeling activity can afford students' coordination of the two
   probability perspectives and the difficulties in the process. This
   analysis shows that adopting an asymmetric random process and having
   students extend their models of a simple event to a compound event are
   helpful for students to coordinate probability perspectives. However,
   potential obstacles to coordination include an authority issue and
   statistical bias.},

   In this article, we investigate a rather unexplored topic with precisely
   such requirements-that is, vector fields. In our study, we first
   presented a series of multiple-choice tasks to 147 introductory
   university students at the beginning of their studies and recorded
   students' eye movements while they matched vector field diagrams and
   equations. Thereafter, students had to solve a similar coordination task
   on paper and justify their reasoning. Two cluster analyses were
   performed including (i) transition and fixation data on diagrams and
   options (Model 1), and (ii) additionally the number of horizontal and
   vertical saccades on the diagram (Model 2). In both models, two clusters
   emerge-with Model 1 distinguishing behaviors related to representational
   mapping and Model 2 additionally differentiating students according to
   representation-specific demands. Model 2 leads to a better distinction
   between the groups in terms of different performance indicators (test
   score, response confidence, and spatial ability) which also transfers to
   another task format. We conclude that vertical and horizontal saccades
   reflect executive actions of perception when approaching vector field
   coordination tasks. Thus, we recommend targeted interventions for
   mathematics lessons; these lessons must focus on a visual handling of
   the vector field diagram. Further, we infer that students' difficulties
   can be attributed to covariational reasoning, thereby indicating the
   need for further investigations. From a methodological perspective, we
   reflect on the triangulation of eye-tracking and verbal data in
   (multiple-choice) assessment scenarios.},

Abstract = {This study investigates social, mathematical, and sociomathematical
   norms perceived by college students in an engineering mathematics course
   and examines the students' sense of mathematics as signals of individual
   merit. Data sources include a survey and one-on-one interviews with 38
   students. The findings help illustrate student perceptions of academic
   social norms in a large-lecture course represented by the acquisition
   model of learning in college, detached from communal and collaborative
   disciplinary practices. Findings provide insights into the local
   educational context of an East Asian country as a case study when
   exam-oriented mathematics is institutionalized as normalcy.},

Abstract = {The many studies with coin-tossing tasks in literature show that the
   concept of randomness is challenging for adults as well as children.
   Systematic errors observed in coin-tossing tasks are often related to
   the representativeness heuristic, which refers to a mental shortcut that
   is used to judge randomness by evaluating how well a set of random
   events represents the typical example for random events we hold in our
   mind. Representative thinking is explained by our tendency to seek for
   patterns in our surroundings. In the present study, predictions of
   coin-tosses of 302 third-graders were explored. Findings suggest that in
   third grade of elementary school, children make correct as well as
   different types of erroneous predictions and individual differences
   exist. Moreover, erroneous predictions that were in line with
   representative thinking were positively associated with an early
   spontaneous focus on regularities, which was assessed when they were in
   second year of preschool. We concluded that previous studies might have
   underestimated children's reasoning about randomness in coin-tossing
   contexts and that representative thinking is indeed associated with
   pattern-based thinking tendencies.},

Abstract = {Understanding the secondary-tertiary transition is not only an
   educational matter, but also an inclusion and equality matter as
   mathematics qualifications lead to better employment and better earning
   for students. Research on what causes the crisis associated to this
   transition has so far focused on the impact of cognitive and
   epistemological changes in university mathematics. Recently, attention
   has been given to sociocultural and affective issues, which indicate the
   impact of diverse contexts on such event in the students' life. Here we
   present a study investigating the experiences of first-year mathematics
   students in three European countries. The study adopted the framework of
   transition as a rite of passage and to detect the changes in attitudes
   towards the mathematics which originated the crisis, the
   three-dimensional model for attitude towards mathematics (TMA) was used.
   Data consist in one questionnaire translated into three languages and
   administered to students in the first year of study. Most of the
   questions were open-ended, and the data were analysed first
   qualitatively and then quantitised. Results show that while the
   transition experiences of the students may seem on the surface uniform,
   some significant differences emerge for motivation to join mathematics
   degrees, motives for changes in perceived competence, and impact of
   university mathematics formalism. We hypothesise a link between these
   changes and the differences in educational environments in the three
   countries. We conclude with highlighting the need for more research of
   this kind to understand the secondary-tertiary transition in the
   educational context in which it happens.},

Abstract = {Designers in out-of-school spaces often negotiate the meaning of
   mathematics as part of the design process, determining what to include
   in classes and exhibits both implicitly and explicitly. This analysis
   suggests that instead of keeping these conversations behind the scenes,
   we should foreground them for participants. In doing so, we may actually
   be helping to expand their sense of what counts as mathematics as they
   participate in legitimate communal activity. The focal analysis examines
   the case of one participant in a knitting summer camp as she encounters
   the mathematics that the facilitator deemed necessary to move the
   knitting project forward. Together they negotiate whether their work
   counts as knitting or as mathematics, and what the consequences for that
   designation are for how they make sense of the activity. I argue that
   this kind of encounter has the potential to build bridges between
   everyday and school mathematics and thus to broaden participation.},

Title = {Closing the gap on the map: Davydov's contribution to current early

Abstract = {Recent scholarship around teaching elementary mathematics supports the
   learning of early algebra with 5- to 12-year olds. However, in spite of
   the recognition of the affordances of early algebra, issues about how to
   introduce it remain open. Within this context, Davydov's work is often
   cited as a source of impressive demonstration of young learners'
   capacity for algebraic thinking. This work requires further exploration
   in order to yield a clearer picture of a very particular teaching
   approach, which focuses on early abstractions and symbolic language. We
   argue that in order to fully understand how Davydov's work contributes
   to current conversations and what Davydov was trying to do, we need to
   shed light on the context- and time-specific discourse of the 1960
   Soviet educational reforms that made it possible for Davydov to develop
   his vision about algebraic thinking and to set in motion appropriate
   teaching approaches for young learners. In this paper, we look back to
   the Soviet debates that unfolded in Russia on the integration of early
   algebra in elementary school word-problem solving. Drawing on these
   debates and the results of Davydov's school experiments, we lay out the
   developmental axes of capacity building. This can be done by emphasizing
   ascent from the abstract to the concrete using a variety of
   representational modeling tools to support the emergence of algebraic
   thinking while targeting particular habits of mind within carefully
   designed learning activities. We conclude with some insights about
   current arithmetic-algebra debates, and how these could be enriched and
   deepened by Davydov's work, which yet remains open to future discussion
   and reflection.},

Abstract = {Students' affective characteristics have been confirmed to shape their
   mathematics learning outcomes, including problem-solving performance and
   mathematics achievement. However, it remains unclear whether affect
   influences student mathematical problem posing - a process closely
   related to mathematical problem solving. Drawn from the expectancy-value
   theory (EVT), this study examined the relationship between students'
   affective factors (self-concept, intrinsic value, and test anxiety) and
   their mathematical problem posing performance (complexity, quantity, and
   accuracy). Structural equation models were employed to analyze the data
   of 302 Chinese Miao students. The results showed that self-concept had a
   positive association with the complexity and accuracy of the problems
   posed. Intrinsic value was positively related to the complexity and
   quantity of the problems posed. Conversely, test anxiety negatively
   predicted the complexity of the problems. Our findings provide
   quantitative evidence of the significant influence of students'
   affective characteristics on their problem posing performance and offer
   a better understanding of the problem-posing ability of Chinese minority
   students. Moreover, this study validates an instrument measuring student
   affect in mathematical problem posing based on EVT.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we offer a framework for teacher monitoring routines-a
   consequential yet understudied aspect of instruction when teachers
   oversee students' working together. Using a comparative case study
   design, we examine eight lessons of experienced secondary mathematics
   teachers, identifying common interactional routines that they take up
   with variation. We present a framework that illuminates the common moves
   teachers make while monitoring, including how they initiate
   conversations with students, their forms of conversational entry, the
   focus of their interactions, when and how they exit the interaction as
   well as the conversation's overall participation pattern. We illustrate
   the framework through our focal cases, highlighting the instructional
   issues the different enactments engage. By breaking down the complex
   work of groupwork monitoring, this study informs both researchers and
   teachers in understanding the teachers' role in supporting students'
   collaborative mathematical sensemaking.},

Abstract = {This investigation details the story of Diego, a novice Mexican teacher
   in secondary school. The story uses a life history approach and
   describes Diego's process of overcoming mathematics anxiety. Diego
   experienced mathematics anxiety due to his lack of mathematical
   knowledge. Having detected this situation, the researchers coached him,
   focusing on his emotional and mathematical knowledge. After this
   coaching, Diego managed to overcome his mathematics anxiety and enjoyed
   teaching mathematics. Cases like Diego's are common among novice
   teachers in Mexico; they are more likely to experience negative emotions
   despite doing their best for their students. His case can also show us a
   path for the relief of negative emotions. We suggest that coaching can
   be used as a strategy to relieve current and future teachers of their
   anxiety in programs for teacher training and in-service training.},

Title = {Affect and emotions in mathematics education: toward a holistic

Abstract = {Emotions and affect have become an area of interest to mathematics
   research. However, both tend to be intellectualized and approached as
   external to and separate from intellect. As far back as in the 1930s,
   Vygotsky considered the split between affect and intellect as
   psychology's greatest defect. To address that defect, over the last
   18-24 months of his life, he sketched the barebones of a different
   psychology but died before he could develop his ideas into a theory of
   emotions. His ideas provided us with a roadmap for developing an
   approach in which intellect and affect are united to constitute a
   central part in the life of the whole person. Such a position, conceived
   here in dramatic terms, remains virtually unknown, in part because of
   the unavailability of specific texts and personal notes until a few
   years ago. In this study, we develop Vygotsky's seeds and go beyond what
   he actually stated. We focus our conceptualization of affect on
   mathematics classroom practices and exemplify our theoretical
   perspective with empirical data drawn from a number of studies.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a way of thinking about ritual that is new to
   mathematics education research and that challenges the more common
   approaches to ritual that dichotomise thinking and acting. We argue for
   a material, monist conceptualisation of ritual, which we refer to as
   ritualisation. In the context of early number work, we show that
   ritualisation can be seen as meaningfuland not simply as rote repetition
   lacking mathematical sophisticationparticularly in relation to a
   symbolically structured environment. We argue that ritualisation
   practices can allow entry into new fields of activity and discourse,
   without going through a phase of merely un-thinking performance.},

Abstract = {We investigate responses of prospective secondary school teachers to a
   task related tothe inverse function concept. We utilize ideas of fuzzy
   logic as a theoretical lens in analyzing the participants' demonstrated
   avoidance of refuting the existence of an inverse to a quadratic
   function. The analysis is based on 29 responses to a scripting task, in
   which participants composed a hypothetical dialog between a teacher and
   students. The findings demonstrate three categories of fuzzy evaluations
   of a mathematical statement: (a) false blurred to be true; (b) almost
   false; and (c) almost true. We offer possible reasons for the prevalence
   of fuzzy thinking in general, and in discussing the inverse of a
   function in particular.},

Abstract = {In mathematics education, researchers have proposed a wide range of
   improvements of teaching practice in school, but only a few of these
   proposals have sustainably changed mathematics education in the desired
   form. This article takes off with the assumption that this gap between
   ideals and practice can be understood and challenged through a better
   understanding of the social functions of mathematics education.
   Functionalism is a sociological paradigm, which is based on the
   assumption that sub-systems of society support each other. The
   application of this theory to mathematics education seeks to illuminate
   the social connectedness of classroom practice and incorporates various
   studies from the field of mathematics education and beyond. Its
   originality lies in its ability to integrate and order results from many
   different socio-political studies in mathematics education and to
   identify research desiderata in the field. On this basis, I show that in
   spite of official discourses on the use-value of mathematics, we lack
   evidence that mathematics education is functional in providing socially
   necessary qualifications in mathematics. Instead, possible other
   functions of mathematics education such as the training of economically
   beneficial character traits, the legitimisation of mathematics as a
   social tool of power, the transfer of social advantages from parents to
   children, the training of a bureaucratic mentality and the projection of
   societal wishes and fears are discussed. The results do not only provoke
   further debate on educational goals of mathematics education but may
   form a basis on which to plan educational innovation with particular
   attention towards social constraints underlying mathematics education.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I problematize traditional notions of statistical
   literacy by juxtaposing it with critical literacy. At the school level
   statistical literacy is vitally important for students who are preparing
   to become citizens in modern societies that are increasingly shaped and
   driven by data based arguments. The teaching of statistics, which is the
   science of data, is firmly rooted in the mathematics curriculum at the
   K-12 school level, making statistical literacy a crucial goal in
   mathematics education. I discuss key ideas from critical literacy in
   formal school contexts, especially within the field of mathematics
   education and intersect those with key ideas from statistical literacy
   to create a critical statistical literacy framework. Potential
   contributions of and barriers to the implementation of a critical
   statistical literacy are discussed.},

Abstract = {After improving enrolment rates significantly, many developing countries
   such as Peru are facing the challenge to increase learning levels among
   students. Over the past few years, many researchers have turned to
   teacher-related variables as a way to better understand classroom
   processes that may help increase learning levels among students. In this
   study, we analyze one of these, that falls under what Shulman
   (Educational Researcher, 15 (2), 4-14, 1986) called pedagogical content
   knowledge (PCK). Specifically, in this study, we analyze one of the
   areas of PCK which is knowledge of content and students. This was
   measured through a test where teachers were asked to explain students'
   mistakes and predict responses in similar mathematics exercises. We
   explore if PCK is associated with the socioeconomic status of children
   and if it has an effect on children's achievement. Additionally, we
   analyze which teacher characteristics are associated with higher scores
   in PCK. The analysis uses the Young Lives longitudinal survey for Peru.
   We found that students' socioeconomic status at age 1 and maternal
   education were positively associated with their teachers' PCK by the
   time students were enrolled in fourth grade, thus depicting a very
   unequal education system. Furthermore, teachers' PCK was positively
   associated with student achievement, but only when a threshold for the
   PCK test was established. For our sample, male teachers, who were
   younger, and Spanish speakers had higher PCK scores.},

Abstract = {Our paper aims at showing how the instrumented learning of the
   properties in Euclidean geometry can be introduced in continuity with
   the mathematical competences developed at the elementary school. The
   principle founder of our research is based on the relation of
   subordination between the constraints of a property, posed using dynamic
   geometry software, and a necessary conclusion. Starting from an
   experimentation carried out in classes of 12-14 years old in France and
   in Quebec, our study presents a critical analysis of results where the
   ultimate objective of the activities suggested to the students relates
   as well to the significance of elementary properties, as on the
   understanding of the necessity of the link between the antecedents to
   the consequents of a deduction. Before ending by the didactic
   consequences of our approach, the text introduces the concept of
   instrumented figural inference as a means, employed by certain students,
   to justify a step of structured reasoning. A reconciling of the
   semiotic, instrumental and discursive aspects is offered throughout the
   paper.},

Abstract = {This study reports the results of a study examining how easily students
   are able to transfer frequency solutions to conditional probability
   problems to novel situations. University students studied either a
   problem solved using the traditional Bayes formula format or using a
   natural frequency (tree diagram) format. In addition, the example
   problem and the target problem presented for solution had matched or
   mismatched context. The results found better performance when students
   studied frequency solutions and when the content of the study problem
   and target problem were matched. Beyond solution to the target problem,
   students did not show any differences in performance on a subsequent
   multiple choice task. Results are discussed in light of Gigerenzer and
   Hoffrage's Psychological Review, 106, 425-430 (1999) claims about the
   effectiveness of using frequency solutions to help teach Bayesian
   conditional probability concepts.},

Abstract = {Confidence assessment (CA), in which students state alongside each of
   their answers a confidence level expressing how certain they are, has
   been employed successfully within higher education. However, it has not
   been widely explored with school pupils. This study examined how school
   mathematics pupils (N=345) in five different secondary schools in
   England responded to the use of a CA instrument designed to incentivise
   the eliciting of truthful confidence ratings in the topic of directed
   (positive and negative) numbers. Pupils readily understood the negative
   marking aspect of the CA process and their facility correlated with
   their mean confidence with r=.546, N=336, p<.001, indicating that pupils
   were generally well calibrated. Pupils' comments indicated that the vast
   majority were positive about the CA approach, despite its dramatic
   differences from more usual assessment practices in UK schools. Some
   pupils felt that CA promoted deeper thinking, increased their confidence
   and had a potential role to play in classroom formative assessment.},

Abstract = {Although lecture is the traditional method of university mathematics
   instruction, there has been little empirical research that describes the
   general structure of lectures. In this paper, we adapt ideas from
   narrative analysis and apply them to an upper-level mathematics lecture.
   We develop a framework that enables us to conceptualize the lecture as
   consisting of collections of narratives to identify connections between
   the narratives and to use the narrative structure to identify key
   features of the lecture. In particular, we use the idea of framing and
   embedded narratives to identify central ideas in the lecture and to
   understand how examples, diagrams, and smaller claims contribute to the
   development of those ideas. Additionally, we create a graph structure
   for the lecture using the repetition of mathematical ideas across
   embedded narratives, and we employ graph-theoretic analysis to support
   our identification of framing narratives and to highlight particular
   roles of embedded narratives.},

Abstract = {School mathematics examination papers are typically dominated by short,
   structured items that fail to assess sustained reasoning or problem
   solving. A contributory factor to this situation is the need for student
   work to be marked reliably by a large number of markers of varied
   experience and competence. We report a study that tested an alternative
   approach to assessment, called comparative judgement, which may
   represent a superior method for assessing open-ended questions that
   encourage a range of unpredictable responses. An innovative problem
   solving examination paper was specially designed by examiners, evaluated
   by mathematics teachers, and administered to 750 secondary school
   students of varied mathematical achievement. The students' work was then
   assessed by mathematics education experts using comparative judgement as
   well as a specially designed, resource-intensive marking procedure. We
   report two main findings from the research. First, the examination paper
   writers, when freed from the traditional constraint of producing a mark
   scheme, designed questions that were less structured and more
   problem-based than is typical in current school mathematics examination
   papers. Second, the comparative judgement approach to assessing the
   student work proved successful by our measures of inter-rater
   reliability and validity. These findings open new avenues for how school
   mathematics, and indeed other areas of the curriculum, might be assessed
   in the future.},

Abstract = {This study investigated features of instructors' classroom discourse on
   the derivative with the commognitive lens. The analysis focused on how
   three calculus instructors addressed the derivative as a point-specific
   value and as a function in the beginning lessons about the derivative.
   The results show that (a) the instructors frequently used secant lines
   and the tangent line on the graph of a curve to illustrate the symbolic
   notation for the derivative at a point without making explicit
   connections between the graphical illustration and the symbolic
   notations, (b) they made a transition from the point-specific view of
   the derivative to the interval view mainly by changing the literal
   symbol for a point to a variable rather than addressing how the quantity
   that the derivative shows, changes over an interval, (c) they quantified
   the derivative as a number using functions with limited graphical
   features, and (d) they often justified the property of the derivative
   function with the slope of the tangent line at a point as an indication
   of the universality of the property. These results show that the aspects
   of the derivative that the past mathematicians and today's students have
   difficulties with are not explicitly addressed in these three
   classrooms. They also suggest that making explicit these aspects of the
   derivative through word use and visual mediators, and making clear
   connections between the ways that the quantities and properties of the
   derivative are visually mediated with symbolic, graphical, and algebraic
   notations would help students to understand why and how the limit
   component for the derivative are illustrated on graphs and expressed
   symbolically, and the derivative is expanded from a point to an
   interval, and properties of the derivative are investigated over an
   interval. More explicit discussions on these ideas perhaps make them
   more accessible to students.},

Abstract = {This study demonstrates the importance of a critical lens on disability
   in mathematics educational research. This ethnographic and interview
   study investigated how ability and disability were constructed over 1
   year in a middle school mathematics classroom. Children participated in
   two kinds of mathematical pedagogy that positioned children differently:
   procedural and discussion-based. These practices shifted over time, as
   the teacher increasingly focused on memorization of procedures to
   prepare for state testing. Two Latino/a children with learning
   disabilities, Ana and Luis, used multiple cultural practices as
   resources, mixing and remixing their engagement in and identifications
   with mathematics. Ana, though mastering the procedural performances
   necessary for success in the second half of the year, authored herself
   as separate from mathematics, creating distance between herself and
   those she considered ``smarties.{''} Luis was identified as a creative
   mathematical problem-solver and was initially positioned as a ``top{''}
   mathematics student. As the pedagogy shifted towards memorization, Luis
   resisted the pedagogy of procedures and continued to identify as a
   creative thinker in mathematics. Yet, his teachers saw him as
   increasingly disabled and eventually placed him in a group only for
   those in special education. This group, which Luis named the
   ``unsmartest group,{''} was seen as least competent in mathematics by
   both teachers and students. The narratives of Luis and Ana highlight
   mathematics classrooms as relational and emotional and demonstrate
   different strategies of resistance to the construction of mathematical
   disability.},

Abstract = {This paper uses a multilevel analysis of mathematical reasoning rooted
   in Cultural Historical Activity Theory to examine how mathematical
   discourse and student reasoning about linear functions developed across
   3 weeks in a ninth grade bilingual algebra class. Despite the teacher's
   expertise teaching with a conceptual focus, and her stated intention to
   focus on slope as a rate of change, the case study students in her class
   appeared to appropriate a procedural understanding of slope. By
   examining the nested activity systems of the students' group
   discussions, the classroom, school, and district, this analysis shows
   how external assessment pressures shaped the teacher's selection of
   tasks, her and her students' use of mathematical discourse, and
   ultimately, her students' opportunity to learn a critical algebraic
   concept.},

Abstract = {Examples are believed to be very important in developing conceptual
   understanding of mathematical ideas, useful both in mathematics research

   69:77-79, 2008; Mason \& Watson, 2008; Bills \& Tall, 1998; Tall \&
   Vinner, 1981). In this study, we draw on the concept of an example space
   (Mason \& Watson, 2008) and variation theory (Runesson in Scandinavian
   Journal of Educational Research 50:397-410, 2006) to create a lens to
   study how examples are used for pedagogical purposes in undergraduate
   proof-based instruction. We adapted the construct of an example space
   and extended its application to the constructs of example neighborhood,
   methods of example construction, and the functions of examples. We
   explained how to use our new lens to analyze the collection of examples
   and non-examples that the students had access to. We then demonstrate
   our method by analyzing the collection of examples and non-examples of a
   mathematical group the professor of an abstract algebra class presented
   during lectures or assigned to students in problem sets or exams.},

Abstract = {Data analysis is constitutive of the discovery sciences. Few studies in
   mathematics education, however, investigate how people deal with
   (statistical) variability and statistical variance in the data to be
   interpreted. And even fewer, if any, focus on the uncertainties with
   which scientists wrestle before they are confident in the data they
   produce. The purpose of this study is to exhibit the work of coping with
   variability in one advanced research laboratory, as exemplified in a
   typical data analysis session. The study shows that when the scientists
   are confronted with novel data, their understanding of the variability
   does not arise in straightforward fashion, and a lot of normally
   invisible (interactional) work is required to constitute understanding.
   Tentative conclusions are provided for the implication to mathematics
   education.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the design and the results of a teaching
   experiment carried out to investigate the hypothesis that it is feasible
   to facilitate the students' possibility for experiencing the
   reactivation of the objectification of the right-angled triangle. For
   this purpose, a teaching design of the Pythagorean Theorem was developed
   and taught to an experimental class of 14-year old students. The results
   of our teaching were compared with a control class with the employment
   of a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The quantitative and
   qualitative analyses supported our hypothesis that the students of the
   experimental class would develop qualitatively different understandings
   of the theorem than the control class, thus suggesting their possibility
   for experiencing the reactivation of the objectification of the
   right-angled triangle.},

Title = {An exploratory study of pre-service middle school teachers' knowledge of
   algebraic thinking},

Volume = {84},

Abstract = {Using algebraic habits of mind as a framework, and focusing on thinking
   about functions and how they work, we examined the relationship between
   18 pre-service middle school teachers' ability to use the features of
   the algebraic thinking (AT) habit of mind ``Building Rules to Represent
   Functions{''} and their ability to recognize and interpret the features
   of the same AT habit of mind in middle school students. We assessed the
   pre-service teachers' own ability to use the AT habit of mind Building
   Rules to Represent Functions by examining their solutions to
   algebra-based tasks in a semester-long mathematics content course. We
   assessed the pre-service teachers' ability to recognize and interpret
   students' facility with the AT habit of mind Building Rules to Represent
   Functions by analyzing their interpretations of students' written
   solutions to algebra-based tasks and their ability to plan and analyze
   AT interviews of middle school students during a concurrent field-based
   education course. The data revealed that the pre-service teachers had a
   limited ability to recognize the full richness of algebra-based tasks'
   potential to elicit the features of Building Rules to Represent
   Functions in students. The pre-service teachers' own overall AT ability
   to Build Rules to Represent Functions was related to their ability to
   recognize the overall ability of students to Build Rules to Represent
   Functions, as exhibited during one-on-one interviews, but not to their
   ability to recognize the overall ability to Build Rules to Represent
   Functions exhibited exclusively in students' written work. Implications
   for mathematics teacher education are discussed.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study examined perspectives of two key stakeholder
   groups, instructors and students, on mathematics content courses for
   prospective elementary teachers (Mathematics for Teachers {[}MFT]
   courses). A collective case study approach, which drew from the data of
   two cases in different but comparable settings, contributed to the
   robustness of the findings. Cross-case analysis of the interview data
   revealed several convergent themes: the role of affect in student
   learning, pedagogy and instructor disposition, connections to the
   elementary classroom, and mathematics content. The findings included
   both conflicting and complementary perspectives between the two key
   stakeholder groups. When juxtaposed, the multiple viewpoints offer
   insights into some of the central issues related to teaching and
   learning in MFT courses and suggest potential avenues for improving
   experiences in these courses.},

Abstract = {We discuss the teachers' disciplinary knowledge of mathematics in this
   article, arguing two main points as we report on a 2-year study
   involving 22 practicing teachers. First we argue that teachers'
   knowledge of mathematics might be productively construed as a complex
   evolving form, a significant dimension of which is tacit knowledge.
   Second, based on our first point, we suggest that this knowledge is
   better understood as a learnable disposition than a domain to be
   mastered.},

Abstract = {This paper reports an intervention phase of a design study aimed to
   assist second-grade Filipino children in solving addition word problems
   in English, a language they primarily encounter only in school. With
   Filipino as the medium of instruction, an out-of-school pedagogical
   intervention providing linguistic and representational scaffolds was
   implemented with 17 children. Pre-intervention, children experienced
   linguistic difficulties and were limited to conceptualising and solving
   simple additive structures. Post-intervention interviews revealed
   improved performance and understanding of more complex structures, but
   only when linguistic difficulties were minimised. The study identified
   socially and culturally driven barriers to learning: superficial
   strategies, children's engagement, and learning in an urban poor
   context.},

Abstract = {Our aim here was to explore, via a specific instance, the potential for
   learners to develop mathematically as a consequence of the interplay
   between intuition and indirect classroom experience rather than through
   explicit tuition. A significant aspect of this study is the recognition
   of the possibility for learners to be able to thematize schemata
   associated with the fundamental theorem of arithmetic without formal
   knowledge of either the theorem or its consequences. Our findings would
   suggest that some learners, by way of a series of key intuitive episodes
   or concrete classroom experiences, do indeed possess the capacity to
   create meaningful mathematical structures that, though perhaps
   imperfectly formed, may in some sense mirror schemata.},

Abstract = {``From Another Perspective{''} is a year-long course for teachers of
   mathematics that is designed to enhance teachers' awareness of the way
   that their students think when they are experiencing difficulties in
   geometry. It also aims at equipping teachers with tools needed to
   analyze and cope with Problematic Learning Situations in geometry (Gal
   \& Linchevski, 2000). This paper reviews the rationale, content, and
   approach of the course, which is characterized as ``the Back and Forth
   model{''}. It then reports on a study that tracked the changes that
   course participants (pre- and in-service mathematics teachers) passed
   through. The paper describes the results of the case study of Eti, one
   of the participants, who taught mathematics to junior high school
   students. The findings suggest that Eti was helped to achieving the
   goals of: (1) expanding and deepening her understanding of students'
   ways of thinking; (2) increasing her awareness of her students'
   processes of thinking in order to identify their difficulties; (3)
   equipping her with appropriate tools to analyze and cope with such
   difficulties; and (4) enhancing her ability to retrieve and utilize this
   knowledge while making instructional decisions. Conclusions and open
   questions for further study are drawn.},

Title = {Instructional responsibility in mathematics education: modelling
   classroom teaching using Swedish data},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-189},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There is an international trend in mathematics education of
   antiauthoritarianism, emphasising cooperative learning and students'
   autonomous search for knowledge. In Sweden, this is framed by `students'
   independent work', characterised by only limited amounts of
   teacher-student and student-student interaction and communication and a
   low level of teacher responsibility for knowledge generation. Research
   investigating occurrence and effects of different dimensions of
   instructional responsibility and authority in classroom practise,
   however, often takes the very presence of instructional responsibility
   for granted. In this paper, an alternative model for description and
   analysis of instructional practice is proposed, which challenges the
   potential of the traditional division into teacher-versus
   student-centred modes of instruction. Theoretical starting points for
   conceptualising and defining mathematics classroom practices focus on
   instructional responsibility both for knowledge generation and for how
   this responsibility would be expressed in instructional practice. It was
   also investigated how this model corresponds with data from TIMSS 2003.
   The empirical results supported the possibility of adopting this
   alternative perspective in modes of instruction.},

Title = {Appropriating geometric series as a cultural tool: a study of student
   collaborative learning},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2},
Pages = {95-116},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to illustrate how students, through
   collaborative small-group problem solving, appropriate the concept of
   geometric series. Student appropriation of cultural tools is dependent
   on five sociocultural aspects: involvement in joint activity, shared
   focus of attention, shared meanings for utterances, transforming actions
   and utterances and use of pre-existing cultural knowledge from the
   classroom in small-group problem solving. As an analytical point of
   departure, four mathematical theoretical components are identified when
   appropriating the cultural tool of geometric series: (1) estimating of
   parameters, (2) establishing of the general term, (3) composing of the
   sum and (4) deciding on convergence. Analyses of five excerpts focused
   on the students' social processes of knowledge objectification and the
   corresponding semiotic means, i.e., lecture notes, linguistic devices,
   gestures, head movements and gaze, to obtain shared foci and meanings.
   The investigation of these processes unveils the manner in which the
   students established links to pre-existing mathematical knowledge in the
   classroom and how they simultaneously combined the various mathematical
   theoretical components that go into appropriating the cultural tool of
   geometric series. From the excerpts, it is evident that the students'
   participation changes throughout their involvement in the
   problem-solving process. The students are gaining mathematical knowing
   through a process of transforming and by establishing shared meanings
   for the concept and its theoretical components.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine gender differences in the
   relations between verbal, spatial, mathematics, and teacher-child
   mathematics interaction variables. Kindergarten children (N=80) were
   videotaped playing games that require mathematical reasoning in the
   presence of their teachers. The children's mathematics, spatial, and
   verbal skills and the teachers' mathematical communication were
   assessed. No gender differences were found between the mathematical
   achievements of the boys and girls, or between their verbal and spatial
   skills. However, mathematics performance was related to boys' spatial
   reasoning and to girls' verbal skills, suggesting that they use
   different processes for solving mathematical problems. Furthermore, the
   boys' levels of spatial and verbal skills were not found to be related,
   whereas they were significantly related for girls. The mathematical
   communication level provided in teacher-child interactions was found to
   be related to girls' but not to boys' mathematics performance,
   suggesting that boys may need other forms of mathematics communication
   and teaching.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a study of instructors' and students' perceptions of
   the knowledge to be learned about limits of functions in a college level
   Calculus course, taught in a North American college institution. I
   modeled these perceptions using a theoretical framework that combines
   elements of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic, developed in
   mathematics education, with a framework for the study of institutions
   developed in political science. While a model of the instructors'
   perceptions could be formulated mostly in mathematical terms, a model of
   the students' perceptions included an eclectic mixture of mathematical,
   social, cognitive, and didactic norms. I describe the models and
   illustrate them with examples from the empirical data on which they have
   been built.},

   meanings in terms of development of semiotic systems (gestures, speech
   in oral and written form, drawings) in a Vygotskian framework, where
   artefacts are used as tools of semiotic mediation. It describes a
   teaching experiment on perspective drawing at primary school (fourth to
   fifth grade classes), starting from a concrete experience with a Durer's
   glass to the interpretation of a new artefact. We analyse the long term
   process of appropriation of the mathematical model of perspective
   drawing (visual pyramid) through the development of gestures, speech and
   drawings under the teacher's guidance.},

Title = {``Mathematics is a battle, but I've learned to survive{''}: becoming a
   disabled student in university mathematics},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 28},
Abstract = {In university mathematics education, students do not simply learn
   mathematics but are shaped and shape themselves into someone
   new-mathematicians. In this study, we focus on the becoming of disabled
   mathematical subjects. We explore the importance of abilities in the
   processes of being and becoming in university mathematics. Our interest
   lies in how teaching and assessment practices provide students with ways
   to understand themselves as both able and disabled, as disabilities are
   only understood with respect to the norm. We analyse narratives of nine
   university students diagnosed with learning disabilities or mental
   health issues to investigate how their subjectivity is constituted in
   discourse. Our analysis shows how the students are shaped and shape
   themselves as disabled mathematicians in relation to speed in
   mathematical activities, disaffection in mathematics, individualism in
   performing mathematics, and measurability of performance. These findings
   cast light on the ableist underpinnings of the teaching and assessment
   practices in university mathematics education. We contend that
   mathematical ableism forms a watershed for belonging in mathematics
   learning practices, constituting rather narrow, ``normal{''} ways of
   being ``mathematically able{''}. We also discuss how our participants
   challenge and widen the idea of an ``able{''} mathematics student. We
   pave the way for more inclusive futures of mathematics education by
   suggesting that rather than understanding the ``dis{''} in disability
   negatively, the university mathematics education communities may use dis
   by disrupting order. Perhaps, we ask, if university mathematics fails to
   enable accessible learning experiences for students who care about
   mathematics, these practices should indeed be disrupted.},

Abstract = {It is well-known that a key to promoting students' mathematics learning
   is to provide opportunities for problem solving and reasoning, but also
   that maintaining such opportunities in student-teacher interaction is
   challenging for teachers. In particular, teachers need support for
   identifying students' specific difficulties, in order to select
   appropriate feedback that supports students' mathematically founded
   reasoning without reducing students' responsibility for solving the
   task. The aim of this study was to develop a diagnostic framework that
   is functional for identifying, characterising, and communicating about
   the difficulties students encounter when trying to solve a problem and
   needing help from the teacher to continue the construction of
   mathematically founded reasoning. We describe how we reached this aim by
   devising iterations of design experiments, including 285 examples of
   students' difficulties from grades 1-12, related to 110 tasks,
   successively increasing the empirical grounding and theoretical
   refinement of the framework. The resulting framework includes diagnostic
   questions, definitions, and indicators for each diagnosis and structures
   the diagnostic process in two simpler steps with guidelines for
   difficult cases. The framework therefore has the potential to support
   teachers both in eliciting evidence about students' reasoning during
   problem solving and in interpreting this evidence.},

Abstract = {Developing students' competence in algorithmic thinking is emerging as
   an objective of mathematics education, but despite its inclusion in
   mathematics curricula around the world, research into students'
   algorithmic thinking seems to be falling behind in this curriculum
   reform. The aim of this study was to investigate how the mathematical
   modelling process can be used as a vehicle for eliciting students'
   algorithmic thinking. To achieve this aim, a generative study was
   conducted using task-based interviews with year 12 students (n = 8) to
   examine how they used the mathematical modelling process to design an
   algorithm that solved a minimum spanning tree problem. I observed each
   students' modelling process and analysed how the task elicited the
   cognitive skills of algorithmic thinking. The findings showed that the
   students leveraged their mathematical modelling competencies to
   formulate a model of the problem using abstraction and decomposition,
   designed their algorithms by devising a fundamental operation to
   transform inputs into outputs during the working mathematically
   transition, and debugged their algorithms during the validating
   transition. Implications for practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {When language is defined narrowly in mathematics classrooms, racially
   and linguistically minoritized students in classrooms could be
   systematically positioned as ``learners of deficiency.{''} Recent
   scholarship calls for expanding the notion of language to emphasize
   embodied expression of mathematical ideas. Taking a critical perspective
   to understand racialized experiences of using languages in disciplinary
   learning spaces, this article proposes the reconceptualization of
   embodiment as a language for racialized multilingual learners. This
   study was conducted in a Grade 1 classroom in a linguistically and
   racially diverse school in Canada. Through a series of professional
   development sessions, we worked with an experienced teacher to redesign
   the normalized and institutionalized pedagogy toward greater mobility of
   racialized multilingual learners' bodies, which was intertwined with
   their intellectual liberation. Focusing on the spatiality of pedagogy,
   the previously restrictive areas in the school were transformed into a
   place that augments embodied expression of mathematical ideas and
   agentive participation of minoritized learners. The analysis focused on
   the embodied discourse that participating racialized multilingual
   students used to actively engage in mathematical discussion. Our
   findings show that the designed pedagogy, characterized by the spatial
   and temporal expansion of the learning environment, offered more spaces
   for uncertainty and spontaneity with the decreased control of the
   teacher as an explicator. Our article furthers anti-colonial approaches
   to understand the intersection of racialized bodies and language in
   mathematics education.},

Abstract = {In this article, we report on a typology of the demands of statistical
   and mathematical products (StaMPs) embedded in media items related to
   the COVID- 19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The typology emerged from a
   content analysis of a large purposive sample of diverse media items
   selected from digital news sources based in four countries. The findings
   encompass nine categories of StaMPs: (1) descriptive quantitative
   information, (2) models, predictions, causality and risk, (3)
   representations and displays, (4) data quality and strength of evidence,
   (5) demographics and comparative thinking, (6) heterogeneity and
   contextual factors, (7) literacy and language demands, (8) multiple
   information sources, and (9) critical demands. We illustrate these
   categories via selected media items, substantiate them through relevant
   research literature, and point to categories that encompass new or
   enhanced types of demands. Our findings offer insights into the rich set
   of capabilities that citizens (including both young people and adults)
   must possess in order to engage these mass media demands, critically
   analyze statistical and mathematical information in the media, evaluate
   the meaning and credibility of news reports, understand public policies,
   and make evidenced-informed judgments. Our conclusions point to the need
   to revise current curricular frameworks and conceptual models (e.g.,
   regarding statistical and probability literacy, adult numeracy), to
   better incorporate notions such as blended knowledge, vagueness, risk,
   strength of evidence, and criticality. Furthermore, more attention is
   needed to the literacy and language demands of media items involving
   statistical and mathematical information. Implications for further
   research and educational practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Mathematical modelling competencies have become a prominent construct in
   research on the teaching and learning of mathematical modelling and its
   applications in recent decades; however, current research is diverse,
   proposing different theoretical frameworks and a variety of research
   designs for the measurement and fostering of modelling competencies. The
   study described in this paper was a systematic literature review of the
   literature on modelling competencies published over the past two
   decades. Based on a full-text analysis of 75 peer-reviewed studies
   indexed in renowned databases and published in English, the study
   revealed the dominance of an analytical, bottom-up approach for
   conceptualizing modelling competencies and distinguishing a variety of
   sub-competencies. Furthermore, the analysis showed the great richness of
   methods for measuring modelling competencies, although a focus on
   (non-standardized) tests prevailed. Concerning design and offering for
   fostering modelling competencies, the majority of the papers reported
   training strategies for modelling courses. Overall, the current
   literature review pointed out the necessity for further theoretical work
   on conceptualizing mathematical modelling competencies while
   highlighting the richness of developed empirical approaches and their
   implementation at various educational levels.},

Abstract = {In the first months of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic became a top
   concern worldwide, media coverage became full of information that
   demands mathematical literacy, or numeracy, to interpret. In this study,
   we examine the public's understanding of mathematical notions that are
   required for understanding the pandemic and predicting its spread. We
   also explore its correlations with several variables: age group and
   gender, educational attainment in mathematics, and mathematics identity.
   To do so, we conducted a cross-sectional survey focusing on mathematical
   knowledge relevant to the pandemic. The survey was distributed to a
   representative sample of the Jewish Israeli population (n = 439).
   Findings showed that participants' educational attainment in mathematics
   was positively correlated with their success in the mathematical media
   literacy tasks. However, even those with high attainment levels did not
   always perform well. Moreover, the explanatory variable with the
   strongest relationship to mathematical media literacy was found to be
   participants' mathematical identity. These results suggest that school
   mathematics, especially in its high levels, may prepare adults to
   understand critical information important for their well-being, such as
   at a time of global pandemic. However, they also demonstrate that a weak
   mathematical identity may significantly hinder adults' engagement with
   such information.},

Abstract = {Although reasoning is a central concept in mathematics education
   research, the discipline is still in need of a coherent theoretical
   framework of mathematical reasoning. With respect to epistemological
   problems in the dominant discourses on proof, mathematical modelling,
   and post-truth politics in the discipline, and in accordance with trends
   in the philosophy of mathematics and in mathematics education research
   in general, it is argued that it is necessary to give a relativist
   account of mathematical reasoning. Hacking's framework of styles of
   reasoning is introduced as a possible solution. This framework
   distinguished between at least six different styles of reasoning, many
   of which are closely connected to mathematics, and argues that these
   frameworks define what we accept as decidable assertions, as
   justifications for such assertions, and as possible objects of such
   assertions. The article ends with a discussion of the implications of
   the framework for chosen fields of mathematics education research, which
   may motivate more focussed studies in the future.},

Abstract = {There is a longstanding conversation in the mathematics education
   literature about proofs that explain versus proofs that only convince.
   In this essay, we offer a characterization of explanatory proofs with
   three goals in mind. We first propose a theory of explanatory proofs for
   mathematics education in terms of representation systems. Then, we
   illustrate these ideas in terms of combinatorial proofs, focusing on
   binomial identities. Finally, we leverage our theory to explain
   audience-dependent and audience-invariant aspects of explanatory proof.
   Throughout, we use the context of combinatorics to emphasize points and
   to offer examples of proofs that can be explanatory or only convincing,
   depending on how one understands the claim being made.},

Title = {Linguistic conventions of mathematical proof writing across pedagogical
   contexts},

Number = {1},
Pages = {43-62},

Abstract = {This paper presents the findings from a survey used to investigate how
   mathematicians perceive the genre of mathematical proof writing at the
   undergraduate level. Mathematicians were asked whether various proof
   excerpts highlighted in four partial proofs were unconventional in each
   one of three pedagogical contexts: undergraduate mathematics textbooks,
   what instructors write on the blackboard in undergraduate mathematics
   courses, and how students write mathematics in these courses. There are
   four main findings. First, there are some potential breaches of
   mathematical language that participants found unconventional regardless
   of the context in which they occur. Second, there are some differences
   in how mathematicians perceived the linguistic conventions in blackboard
   proofs and student-produced proofs. Third, textbook authors are expected
   to adhere to stricter writing norms than mathematics instructors and
   undergraduate students when writing proofs. Fourth, there were some
   potential breaches of mathematical language that the literature suggests
   were unconventional, which were not evaluated as unconventional by the
   mathematicians. We argue that this diversity of expectations regarding
   the language of mathematical proof writing in undergraduate classrooms,
   together with the potential disconnect between those expectations and
   the types of proofs that students see presented in those classrooms,
   could make it difficult for students to become proficient in this
   important mathematical discourse.},

Abstract = {Ritual teaching, which provides students with ritual opportunities to
   learn, is common worldwide, notwithstanding extensive research calls for
   more reform-oriented teaching. Such resilience to change suggests that
   there are gains for ritual teaching. Therefore, in this study, we search
   for possible goals of ritual teaching. For this purpose, we suggest two
   notions: ritual-enabling and exploration-requiring opportunities to
   learn and seeking possible goals that could be achieved by
   ritual-enabling opportunities to learn. We adopted the commognitive
   framework and developed a methodological tool for analyzing lessons
   using the ritual-exploration lens. We analyzed 11 videos and transcripts
   of eighth-grade mathematics lessons from the 1999 TIMSS study. Our
   findings suggest that ritual teaching is essential both for object-level
   and meta-level learning as it serves as a basis for explorations, and
   for helping students in their initial steps of entering a new discourse.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine how it is possible, in the teaching and
   learning of geometry, to bridge the gap between problems involving
   drawings and figures, which is essential to the learning of mathematical
   proof. More precisely, the way students' drawing perception has to
   evolve, from Iconic Visualization to Non-Iconic Visualization (Duval,
   Annales de Didactique et de Sciences Cognitives, 10, 5-53, 2005). We
   show that the Instrumental Deconstruction process is multifaceted and
   central in this evolution. We present a theoretical framework, in
   relation with an experiment based on a 3D dynamic geometry environment.
   Based on a case study, we show that construction tasks with specific
   representations make the instrumental work play a key role in the
   learning of geometry.},

Title = {Does constructing multiple solutions for real-world problems affect
   self-efficacy?},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {100},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-60},

Abstract = {The development of multiple solutions for a given problem is important
   for learning mathematics. In the present intervention study, we analyzed
   whether prompting students to construct multiple solutions (more
   precisely: prompting them to apply multiple mathematical procedures to
   real-world problems) and prior self-efficacy influenced students'
   self-efficacy directly as well as indirectly via perceived competence.
   Students' self-efficacy (N=304) was measured before and after a 4-lesson
   teaching unit, and students' perceived competence was measured during
   the unit. Results of the path model showed that although prompting
   multiple solutions did not positively affect self-efficacy, indirect
   effects of teaching method on self-efficacy were found. Students who
   were asked to develop multiple solutions perceived higher competence and
   reported higher self-efficacy than students who were required to provide
   one solution. These indirect effects were significant for students with
   low prior self-efficacy and nonsignificant for students with high prior
   self-efficacy, indicating the moderating effect of prior self-efficacy.
   This finding indicates that students with unfavorable learning
   prerequisites such as low self-efficacy might benefit from teaching
   methods that require them to construct multiple solutions. Further,
   students with low prior self-efficacy reported lower competence during
   the lessons regardless of whether they were asked to develop one or
   multiple solutions; they also reported lower self-efficacy at posttest
   prior self-efficacy was controlled for. Our findings therefore indicate
   that disadvantages for students with low prior self-efficacy for the
   further development of self-efficacy during learning might be balanced
   by teaching students to construct multiple solutions.},

Abstract = {The paper focuses on four upper secondary students' collaborative
   small-group mathematical reasoning (MR) with respect to a sinusoidal
   function. The students were collaboratively engaged in a process of MR
   regarding the relationships between mathematical theoretical
   descriptions of parameters in the algebraic expression of the sinusoidal
   function and their counterparts when identifying these parameters
   together with their numerical value in a problem situation. Students'
   reasoning on the mathematical tool of this sinusoidal function is
   manifold and multicoloured. Adopting a dialogical approach to the
   analyses of student interaction, the study reveals that the students'
   MR, viewed as comprising both process aspects and structural aspects, is
   characterised by three features. Firstly, the analyses show that the
   students' MR is characterised by tensions between the mathematical tool
   and its use in situ, called resistance. Secondly, the students' MR is
   characterised by their use of semiotic means of objectification such as
   deictics, gestures, linguistic devices and the text book. Thirdly, the
   analyses reveal that MR is characterised by the students' efforts to
   interthink and collaborate in order to achieve the goal of their
   collective task solving. All four students contributed to the collective
   MR, however, in various ways and to a varying degree.},

Abstract = {We were interested in exploring the extent to which advanced mathematics
   lecturers provide students with opportunities to play a role in
   considering or generating course content. To do this, we examined the
   questioning practices of 11 lecturers who taught advanced mathematics
   courses at the university level. Because we are unaware of other studies
   examining advanced mathematics lecturers' questioning, we first analyzed
   the data using an open coding scheme to categorize the types of content
   lecturers solicited and the opportunities they provided students to
   participate in generating course content. In a second round of analysis,
   we examined the extent to which lecturers provide students with
   opportunities to generate mathematical contributions and to engage in
   reasoning that researchers have identified as important in advanced
   mathematics. Our findings highlight that, although lecturers asked many
   questions, lecturers did not provide substantial opportunities for
   students to participate in generating mathematical content and
   reasoning. Additionally, we provide several examples of lecturers
   providing students with some opportunities to generate important
   contributions. We conclude by providing implications and areas for
   future research.},

Abstract = {Classroom data modeling involves posing questions, identifying
   attributes of phenomena, measuring and structuring these attributes, and
   then composing, revising, and communicating the outcomes. Selecting
   attributes is a fundamental component of data modeling, and the
   considerations made when selecting attributes is the focus of this
   paper. A teaching experiment involving 2 teacher educators and 25
   pre-service teachers (PSTs) was carried out with 24 young children
   (5-6-year-olds) as part of a 4-day data modeling investigation. Although
   perceptual features of the data influenced initial approaches to
   attribute selection, considerations of the problem situation influenced
   a shift from the perceptual and towards consideration of attributes such
   as taxonomy, habitat, behavior, and diet. Expertise in the data context
   (animal kingdom) and ability to collaborate and negotiate within groups
   supported children in their ability to switch attributes, attend to
   multiple situations presented by the problem, and modify and extend
   their categorizations of data.},

Abstract = {A proof is a connected sequence of assertions that includes a set of
   accepted statements, forms of reasoning and modes of representing
   arguments. Assuming reasoning to be central to proving and aiming to
   develop knowledge about how teacher actions may promote students'
   mathematical reasoning, we conduct design research where whole-class
   mathematical discussions triggered by exploratory tasks play a key role.
   We take mathematical reasoning as making justified inferences and we
   consider generalizing and justifying central reasoning processes.
   Regarding teacher actions, we consider inviting, informing/suggesting,
   supporting/guiding and challenging actions can be identified in
   whole-class discussions. This paper presents design principles for an
   intervention geared to tackle such reasoning processes and focuses on a
   whole-class discussion on a grade 7 lesson about linear equations and
   functions. Data analysis concerns teacher actions in relation to design
   principles and to the sought mathematical reasoning processes. The
   conclusions highlight teacher actions that lead students to generalize
   and justify. Generalizations may arise from a central challenging action
   or from several guiding actions. Regarding justifications, a main
   challenging action seems to be essential, while follow-up guiding
   actions may promote a further development of this reasoning process.
   Thus, this paper provides a set of design principles and a
   characterization of teacher actions which enhance students' mathematical
   reasoning processes such as generalization and justification.},

Abstract = {In this theoretical paper, we present a framework for conceptualizing
   proof in terms of mathematical values, as well as the norms that uphold
   those values. In particular, proofs adhere to the values of establishing
   a priori truth, employing decontextualized reasoning, increasing
   mathematical understanding, and maintaining consistent standards for
   acceptable reasoning across domains. We further argue that students'
   acceptance of these values may be integral to their apprenticeship into
   proving practice; students who do not perceive or accept these values
   will likely have difficulty adhering to the norms that uphold them and
   hence will find proof confusing and problematic. We discuss the
   implications of mathematical values and norms with respect to proof for
   investigating mathematical practice, conducting research in mathematics
   education, and teaching proof in mathematics classrooms.},

Abstract = {Early experiences with theoretical thinking and generalization in
   measurement are hypothesized to develop constructs we name here as
   logical reasoning and preparedness for algebra. Based on work of V. V.
   Davydov (1975), the Measure Up (MU) elementary grades experimental
   mathematics curriculum uses quantities of area, length, volume, and mass
   to contextualize the relationships among the quantities in, for example,
   R + C = T. This quasi-experimental study, conducted with 129 fifth- and
   sixth-grade students, examines MU effects on students' preparedness for
   algebra. Structural equation modeling is used to identify a system of
   relationships among the variables in our proposed model. Findings show
   significant direct standardized effects from MU to preparedness (0.28, p
   < .05) and from logical reasoning to preparedness (0.89, p < .05).
   Although positive, the effect of MU mediated by logical reasoning was
   not statistically significant. This suggests that the development of
   logical reasoning abilities, attributed to theoretical thinking and
   generalization, lag preparedness for algebra. It also suggests that MU
   can potentially contribute to algebra preparedness for students who may
   not have developed strong logical reasoning abilities. The findings are
   discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications for
   the successful study of algebra.},

Abstract = {Student autonomy has been an important object of study for mathematics
   educators for many years. Over time, framings of autonomy have moved
   from a focus on the individual to considerations of how an individual's
   autonomy is entangled in classroom-level interactions. What has been
   less closely studied is how classroom interactions provide uneven access
   to autonomy for individuals. This study uses a communicational
   perspective to clarify Piaget's intellectual autonomy and examine
   students' mathematical interactions. The findings describe barriers and
   supports to autonomous activity for three students. Students were
   prevented from engaging in autonomous activity when they were seen as
   less capable than others, when they felt the need to manage the
   activities of their peers, or when they focused on being seen as
   knowledgeable. In contrast, students acted with autonomy when they took
   up the teacher's request for explanations, noticed a contrast between
   their answer and the right answer, and worked on making connections
   across different representations.},

Abstract = {This article addresses one way in which decades of mathematics education
   research results can inform practice, by offering a framework for
   designing and implementing an in-service teacher education programme for
   upper secondary mathematics teachers in Denmark. The programme aims to
   educate a ``task force{''} of so-called ``maths counsellors{''}, i.e.,
   mathematics teachers whose goal it is to help identify students with
   genuine learning difficulties in mathematics, investigate the nature of
   these difficulties, and carry out research-based interventions to assist
   the students in overcoming them. We present and discuss the various
   components of the programme, theoretical as well as practical, and
   account for how these make up a framework for designing a research-based
   ``maths counsellor{''} teacher programme.},

Title = {A boundary-crossing approach to support students' integration of
   statistical and work-related knowledge},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {223-237},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Vocational students and beginning professionals typically find it hard
   to integrate the mathematics and statistics that they have learned at
   school with work-related knowledge. To explore how such an integration
   process could be supported, we conducted an intervention in secondary
   vocational laboratory education. Our boundary-crossing approach was
   informed by the literature on boundary crossing and accompanying
   learning mechanisms (e.g., reflection in the form of perspective making
   and taking, and transformation in the form of hybridization). We
   hypothesized that reflection, as making and taking perspectives on
   school-taught and work-related knowledge, could lead to transformation,
   i.e., help students integrate these types of knowledge into a hybridized
   whole. Data collection included video and audio recordings of five 1-h
   meetings with three students, the data from their research projects, and
   interviews with the teacher and two workplace supervisors. The analysis
   of the students' reasoning during the meetings revealed that their level
   of integrating school-taught statistics and work-related knowledge
   increased significantly and with a medium effect size. This suggests
   that a boundary-crossing approach can support students in integrating
   school-taught and work-related knowledge.},

Abstract = {In this commentary I will address the notions of work, the need for
   innovation, and the role of workplace mathematics. I will then provide
   an overview of some of the complex issues that confront the subfield of
   vocational mathematics education with consequences for current and
   future workers, drawing in part on the work of Basil Bernstein. Finally,
   I will address the question of workplace research and offer some
   possible directions for future research, as well as implications for
   policy. Reflections on the articles included in this special issue will
   frame the discussion.},

Abstract = {Gender differences in mathematical achievement have been examined in a
   wide range of age groups but only a few studies addressed this issue in
   preschool children. We compared preschool girls (n = 570) and boys (n =
   524) from Germany with regard to numerical competencies. Differences in
   overall group means and the frequency of representation at low, middle,
   or high levels of performance were explored for girls and boys. Analysis
   of overall group means revealed that boys showed a better performance
   than girls (d = .32). The analysis of frequencies showed differences in
   both tails but not in the middle of the distribution of numerical
   competencies. While boys were more often found at higher levels of
   performance, girls were found to be overrepresented in the low-ability
   end of the distribution. These findings demonstrate that gender
   differences in mathematical achievement can emerge before school entry
   and stress the importance of further research looking for gender divides
   in mathematical achievement in preschool children from different
   countries as well as possible underlying factors.},

Title = {Epistemic schemes and epistemic states. A study of mathematics

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-91},

Abstract = {The paper introduces an interpretative framework that contains a
   characterization of epistemic schemes (constructs that are used to
   explain how class agents themselves are able to gain convincement in or
   promote convincement of mathematical statements) and epistemic states (a
   person's internal states, such as convincement or certainty related to
   the person's beliefs and to the schemes that explain them); a taxonomy
   for the epistemic schemes is also proposed. On the basis of the
   interpretative framework, an analysis is made of an excerpt of a regular
   elementary school class, a school level at which explicit mathematics
   reasoning rarely arises. The paper contends that teachers and students
   use schemes based on reasons in order to make mathematical statements
   credible, but that they also resort-perhaps unconsciously-to epistemic
   schemes that are governed by extra-rational considerations.},

Abstract = {Students' engagement with fictions in the form of ``word problems{''}
   plays an important role in classroom practice as well as in theories of
   mathematical learning. Drawing on the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga and
   the Austrian philosopher Robert Pfaller, I show that this activity can
   be seen as a form of play or game, where it is pretended that
   mathematics is useful in real life in a way that it is not. With
   Pfaller, I argue that play can take hold of the imagination of the
   players, infusing everyday life with meaning borrowed from the imagery
   of the play and that these effects are more powerful when the play is
   forced and takes an institutionalized form. I show that mathematics
   education does in fact have these characteristics, including
   sophisticated mechanisms for translating in-game performance (test
   scores) to real-life goods (grades and examinations). A central theme of
   the article is the perceived discrepancy between mathematics education
   as it is, and how it supposedly could and should be in light of the
   properties of mathematics. The analysis implies that this gap actually
   is an effect of play and thus an inherent property of mathematics
   education itself.},

Abstract = {This article presents a description of a South African mathematics
   teacher's struggles to mediate a new national assessment tool called the
   Common Tasks for Assessment with her grade 9 learners, who are
   unprepared for the assessment. The purpose of the study is to describe
   and to identify the constraints on the teacher's mediation attempts. The
   study is set in the context of an under-resourced classroom with a large
   number of learners, from disadvantaged backgrounds, who have serious
   problems with fundamental mathematical concepts. The analytical
   framework for the study draws upon actions, processes, objects and
   schemas theory and Valsiner's zone theory. Data for the case study were
   generated from seven lesson observations, two interviews with the
   teacher and a focus group interview with a group of learners from the
   class. The findings reveal that the teacher's practice was impeded by
   the learners' (non)readiness for the task, the task demands, the
   restrictions of the curriculum demands, as well as the fact that the
   modern assessment policy was irreconcilable with the classroom reality.
   The article concludes by calling for a closer alignment of curriculum
   implementation plans with the classroom realities of teachers such as
   the one presented in the study.},

Abstract = {The semiotic approach to mathematics education introduces the notion of
   ``semiotic system{''} as a tool to describe mathematical activity. The
   semiotic system is formed by the set of signs, the production rules of
   signs and the underlying meaning structures. In this paper, we present
   the notions of system of practices and configuration of objects and
   processes that complement the notion of semiotic system and help to
   understand the complex nature of mathematical objects. We also show in
   what sense these notions facilitate the description and comprehension of
   building and communicating mathematical knowledge, by applying them to
   analyze semiotic systems involved in the teaching and learning of some
   elementary arithmetic concepts.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the strategies employed by
   advanced high school and university students working on six tasks
   concerning comparison and conservation of area. Special care has been
   taken in the test design so that the problems could be dealt with using
   a variety of solution methods. Written responses and in-depth interviews
   with 21 12th graders and university students of mathematics provided the
   empirical data. The results show that the majority of the participants
   either did not prefer or had difficulties employing adequately formal
   reasoning. Visualization factors seem to exert considerable influence.
   Moreover, many students confuse congruence with area equivalence.},

Abstract = {The availability of technology in the mathematics classroom challenges
   the way teachers orchestrate student learning. Using the theory of
   instrumental orchestration as the main interpretative framework, this
   study investigates which types of orchestrations teachers develop when
   using technology and to what extent these are related to teachers' views
   on mathematics education and the role of technology therein. Data
   consisted of videotapes of 38 lessons taught by three teachers, who also
   provided information on their views through questionnaires and
   interviews. Qualitative analysis of these data led to the identification
   of orchestration types and teacher profiles. The orchestration
   preferences of the three teachers proved to be related to their views. A
   detailed analysis of one exemplary episode suggests how other
   theoretical perspectives might complement the theory of instrumental
   orchestration.},

Abstract = {This article presents the partial results obtained in the first stage of
   the research, which sought to answer the following questions: (a) What
   is the role of intuition in university students' solutions to
   optimization problems? (b) What is the role of rigor in university
   students' solutions to optimization problems? (c) How is the combination
   of intuition and rigor expressed in university students' solutions to
   optimization problems? (d) Is there really an optimizing intuition? In
   the first part, we provide reasons that make it plausible to consider
   intuition as a vector (metaphorically speaking) with three components:
   idealization, generalization, and argumentation. In the second part, we
   present the experimental design of the research and analyze the data to
   answer the questions previously asked. The experimental design does not
   allow us to falsify the hypothesis that some students have an optimizing
   intuition.},

Abstract = {This study is part of a project concerned with the analysis of how
   students work with two-variable functions. This is of fundamental
   importance given the role of multivariable functions in mathematics and
   its applications. The portion of the project we report here concentrates
   on investigating the relationship between students' notion of subsets of
   Cartesian three-dimensional space and the understanding of graphs of
   two-variable functions. APOS theory and Duval's theory of semiotic
   representations are used as theoretical framework. Nine students, who
   had taken a multivariable calculus course, were interviewed. Results
   show that students' understanding can be related to the structure of
   their schema for R-3 and to their flexibility in the use of different
   representations.},

Abstract = {The introduction of the concept of the variable represents a critical
   point in the arithmetic-algebraic transition. This concept is complex
   because it is used with different meanings in different situations. Its
   management depends on the particular way of using it in problem-solving.
   The aim of this paper was to analyse whether the notion of ``unknown{''}
   interferes with the interpretation of the variable ``in functional
   relation{''} and the kinds of languages used by the students in
   problem-solving. We also wanted to study the concept of the variable in
   the process of translation from algebraic language into natural
   language. We present two experimental studies. In the first one, we
   administered a questionnaire to 111 students aged 16-19 years. Drawing
   on the conclusions of this research we carried out the second study with
   two pairs of students aged 16-17 years.},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to present a sketch of what, following the
   German social theorist Arnold Gehlen, may be termed ``sensuous
   cognition.{''} The starting point of this alternative approach to
   classical mental-oriented views of cognition is a multimodal
   ``material{''} conception of thinking. The very texture of thinking, it
   is suggested, cannot be reduced to that of impalpable ideas; it is
   instead made up of speech, gestures, and our actual actions with
   cultural artifacts (signs, objects, etc.). As illustrated through an
   example from a Grade 10 mathematics lesson, thinking does not occur
   solely in the head but also in and through a sophisticated semiotic
   coordination of speech, body, gestures, symbols and tools.},

Abstract = {While reading the articles assembled in this volume, one cannot help
   asking Why gestures? What's all the fuss about them? In the last few
   years, the fuss is, indeed, considerable, and not just here, in this
   special issue, but also in research on learning and teaching at large.
   What changed? After all, gestures have been around ever since the birth
   of humanity, if not much longer, but until recently, not many students
   of human cognition seemed to care. In this commentary, while reporting
   on what I saw while scrutinizing this volume for an answer, I will share
   some thoughts on the relationship between gesturing and speaking and
   about their relative roles in mathematical thinking.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-90},

Abstract = {It is widely recognized that purely cognitive behavior is extremely rare
   in performing mathematical activity: other factors, such as the
   affective ones, play a crucial role. In light of this observation, we
   present a reflection on the presence of affective and cognitive factors
   in the process of proving. Proof is considered as a special case of
   problem solving and the proving process is studied adopting a
   perspective according to which both affective and cognitive factors
   influence it. To carry out our study, we set up a framework where
   theoretical tools coming from research on problem solving, proof and
   affect are present. The study is performed within a university course in
   mathematics education, where students were given a statement in
   elementary number theory to be proved and were asked to write down their
   proving process and the thoughts that accompanied this process. We
   scrutinize the written protocols of two unsuccessful students, with the
   aim of disentangling the intertwining between affect and cognition. In
   particular, we seize the moments in which beliefs about self and beliefs
   about mathematical activity shape the performance of our students.},

Title = {Weaving together the threads of Indigenous knowledge and mathematics},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 14},
Abstract = {As in many countries, for decades in Aotearoa (New Zealand), we have
   heard the story of the Pacific and Maori achievement gap in mathematics.
   This has become a widely accepted part of beliefs constructed across
   multiple communities about students and schools and who can do and learn
   mathematics successfully. A common response by policy makers and
   educators alike is to fix the problem of those deemed academically bleak
   by putting in place a range of interventions. In this article, we
   challenge the positioning of Pacific students as a problem to be fixed
   and instead focus on how we can address the practices inherent in
   historical forms of institutionalised racism related to colonisation. We
   use an Indigenous research model-Tivaevae-to develop an exemplary case
   study of the teachers and students from one low socio-economic urban
   school as they were involved in conscientisation and the reconstitution
   of educational practices to privilege indigenous knowledge systems. The
   findings highlight one model of how teachers and students can change
   institutionalised Western world practices in the mathematics classroom.
   We argue that the shift to honouring indigenous knowledge systems and a
   strength-based approach provided opportunities for Pacific students to
   learn mathematics in ways that supported them to build strong
   mathematical dispositions, and rather than being assimilated, retain
   their cultural identity.},

Abstract = {Students' opportunities to persevere in making sense of mathematical
   ideas have long been considered significant to learning. Building on
   existing literature and a case study of video-based teacher
   collaborative sensemaking, we propose a conceptual framework for
   bridging perseverance and sensemaking. This framework synthesizes
   dispositional, metacognitive, and contextual-interactive theoretical
   perspectives on perseverance. Informed by these three research
   perspectives, the conceptual framework brings forth three interrelated
   mediators for bolstering perseverance practices and dispositions towards
   mathematical sensemaking: students' positions as capable sensemakers,
   explicit problem-solving heuristics, and facilitation of student
   participation within their collective Zone of Proximal Development
   (ZPD). We argue that the three mediators, when brought together, provide
   a holistic and generative lens for teaching and teacher learning. To
   illustrate the framework and its utility, we build on a case study
   featuring a veteran middle-school mathematics teacher across his
   classroom facilitation of students' engagement with a classical
   mathematical task, the Tower of Hanoi, and a subsequent video-based
   debrief about the lesson with his colleague and our research team. We
   first frame the analysis around classroom events, and then investigate
   teacher learning opportunities in the lesson debrief. By making explicit
   the complex work of directing perseverance towards sensemaking, this
   study provides a more nuanced understanding of perseverance for teaching
   and teacher learning. Moreover, developing clarity around notions of
   perseverance in mathematics classrooms helps mitigate the potential
   dangers of the term being taken up in ineffective or even harmful ways.},

Abstract = {Supporting children's understanding of the everyday, cultural use of
   written numerals is highly significant, as it is this understanding that
   gives meaning to classroom conversations on the purposes of written
   numbers. This paper presents findings from a phenomenographic study of
   the qualitatively different ways in which 3-5-year-old children
   interpret the meanings and use of numerals in everyday contexts. The
   study involved a volunteer sample of 37 preschool children. With their
   family's support, children played a Number Spotting game, taking
   photographs of numerals in their environments. These photographs were
   supplemented with other photographs selected by the researchers and used
   in individual photo-elicitation interviews with children. We collected
   data on children's interpretations of a range of examples of numerals
   used to denote quantity, order and measurement, and numerals used as
   labels/identifiers. The findings document qualitatively different
   categories that capture the range of children's expressed conceptions as
   well as the critical aspects of variation that underpin how
   qualitatively different categories of conceptions differ or relate to
   each other. The study provides original insights into the nature and
   structure of children's awareness of the cultural uses of written
   numerals. The findings can support early mathematics teaching to make
   meaningful connections between the knowledge that children develop
   outside of school and the new knowledge about written numbers that they
   develop in formal education.},

Abstract = {What do ethical relations look like in the context of the many
   injustices that pervade mathematics education? In this paper, I argue,
   first, that violence is the relation that characterizes much of
   contemporary mathematics education and, second, that understanding
   ethical relations requires considering mathematics as an equal actor in
   creating possible relations rather than simply treating it as a context
   for human relations. I examine how literature in care theory,
   emancipatory pedagogies, and mathematics education have framed ethical
   relationality and suggest that the feminist new materialist
   conceptualization of response-ability offers several contributions for
   rethinking agency, justice, and praxis for mathematics teachers
   concerned with addressing mathematical violence.},

Title = {Reflecting geometrical shapes: approaches of primary students to
   reflection tasks and relations to typical error patterns},

Abstract = {Students' issues dealing with reflection tasks, especially with inclined
   mirror lines, are widely known. Previous research conducted with primary
   school students mainly focussed on task difficulty and students'
   outcomes, especially their errors of reflection. Little is known about
   which not obviously sustainable understanding of reflection leads to
   what kind of errors. To address this issue, the purpose of this study is
   to explore which approaches students use in their solution finding
   processes when dealing with reflection tasks. We also investigated
   whether there was a relationship between the students' approaches and
   correct or incorrect solution products. This article discusses a
   task-based interview study focussing on approaches used in the students'
   solution process of four reflection tasks. To gather data, 42 interviews
   with students at the end of primary school in Germany were conducted.
   For the analysis, a category system with the categories ``properties of
   reflection,{''} ``holistic approaches,{''} ``gestures and actions
   illustrating the process of reflection,{''} and ``mental images
   illustrating the process of reflection,{''} was developed and validated.
   We observed that there is a relation between the approaches used by the
   students during their process of solving reflection tasks and their
   solution products. The observed relationship between the approaches
   applied during the solution processes and the solutions themselves leads
   to the assumption that the approaches the students used reveal varying
   degrees of mathematical understanding of reflection. As emphasized in
   the discussion of the results, it is important to take a differentiated
   look on the students' solution products and the importance of adequate
   instruction methods.},

Abstract = {Although there is much research exploring students' covariational
   reasoning, there is less research exploring the ways students can
   leverage such reasoning to coordinate more than two quantities. In this
   paper, we describe a system of covariational relationships as a
   comprehensive image of how two varying quantities, having the same
   attribute across different objects, each covary with respect to a third
   quantity and in relation to each other. We first describe relevant
   theoretical constructs, including reasoning covariationally to construct
   relationships between quantities and reasoning covariationally to
   compare quantities. We then present a conceptual analysis entailing
   three interrelated activities we conjectured could support students in
   reasoning covariationally to conceive of a system of covariational
   relationships and represent the system graphically. We provide results
   from two teaching experiments with four middle school students engaging
   in tasks designed with our conceptual analysis in mind. We highlight two
   different ways students reasoned covariationally compatible with our
   conceptual analysis. We discuss the implications of our results and
   provide areas for future research.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the difficulties faced by a group of middle school
   students (13- to 15-year-olds) attempting to translate algebraic
   statements written in verbal language into symbolic language and vice
   versa. The data used were drawn from their replies to a written quiz and
   semi-structured interviews. In the former, students were confronted with
   a series of algebraic statements and asked to choose the sole
   translation, of four proposed for each, that was semantically congruent
   with the original. The results show that most of the errors detected
   were due to arithmetic issues, especially around the distinction between
   product and exponent or sum and product in connection with the notions
   of perimeter and area. As a rule, the error distribution by type varied
   depending on the type of task involved.},

Abstract = {We used an assessment platform to study the potential of rich student
   data obtained online to influence classroom instruction and help
   teachers respond to students' needs. The article focuses on
   technology-based formative assessment in the course of teaching a unit
   on quadrilaterals. We studied example-eliciting tasks, requiring
   students to determine the truth of a given claim and to use interactive
   diagrams to construct examples to support their answer. Our aim was to
   teach the concept of parallelogram by exploring students' concept images
   and responding adequately to their submissions. A group of 11-year-old
   students studied the unit as part of their geometry curriculum. We used
   an assessment platform, which provides tools designed to monitor
   examples produced by students interacting with a dynamic geometry
   environment and to characterize critical and non-critical attributes of
   the submitted constructions. We present the teaching decisions made by
   the teacher (the first author), who used automatic feedback on the
   characteristics of three assessment tasks.},

Abstract = {Maturity and citizenship in a democracy require that laypersons are able
   to critically evaluate experts' use of mathematics. Learning to
   critically reflect on the use of mathematics, including the acquisition
   of the mathematical knowledge and skills required to that end, has been
   repeatedly postulated as an indispensable goal of compulsory education
   in mathematics. However, it remained unclear in how far such reflection
   is possible, even for the well-educated layperson in mathematics. We use
   different discussions in German mass media on the pandemic policy in the
   SARS-CoV-2 crisis in 2020 as examples with far-reaching individual and
   social consequences. The selected discussions build heavily on
   mathematical concepts such as mortality rates, casualty numbers,
   reproduction numbers, and exponential growth. We identify the concepts
   and discuss how far they can be understood by laypersons. On the one
   hand, we found that some mathematical models are inappropriate, which
   can also be determined by laypersons. On the other hand, we found uses
   of mathematics where ideal concepts are intermingled with complex
   statistical concepts. While only the ideal concepts can be understood by
   laypersons, only the statistical concepts lead to actual data. The
   identification of both types of concepts leads to a situation where the
   use of mathematics evades social control and opens spaces for
   misconceptions and manipulation. We conclude that the evaluation of
   experts' use of mathematics by laypersons is not possible in all
   relevant cases, and we discuss possible implications of this result.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between children's subitizing
   activity and their construction of arithmetic units. In particular, the
   study hypothesizes a positive association between children's
   construction of subitized units and their construction of arithmetic
   units, and hypothesizes that children who can subitize larger units,
   such as five items, in kindergarten, are more likely to construct
   arithmetic units by the beginning of first grade. Data for this study
   were drawn from 3,660 children surveyed at the beginning of kindergarten
   in 2014, 2015, and 2016, and at the beginning of first grade in the
   following year. The children are from a single school district in the
   southwest United States. Logistic regression was used to model the
   likelihood of constructing arithmetic units based on children's earlier
   construction of subitized units. Findings provide evidence of a positive
   relationship between children's construction of subitized units and
   arithmetic units, and, on average, children who have constructed
   subitized units at the beginning of kindergarten are more likely to
   construct arithmetic units by the beginning of first grade. Based on the
   findings, theoretical and instructional implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Although mathematical modeling plays an important role in many curricula
   worldwide, significant discrepancies persist in the importance of
   mathematical modeling in ordinary mathematics classrooms and teacher
   education. This paper compares pre-service mathematics teachers'
   professional mathematical modeling competencies in three different
   regions-Germany, Mainland China, and Hong Kong-where educational and
   cultural traditions differ, including the role of mathematical modeling.
   In total, 232 pre-service mathematics teachers from the three regions
   completed a modeling task covering mathematics content knowledge (MCK)
   of modeling and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge (MPCK) of
   modeling. The results show that pre-service teachers from Germany
   demonstrated the strongest MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling; by
   contrast, pre-service mathematics teachers from Mainland China and Hong
   Kong demonstrated relatively weaker MCK and MPCK of mathematical
   modeling. MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling were also found to be
   unevenly developed at different competence levels for the three regions.
   These differences may be attributed to the history of mathematical
   modeling in mathematics curricula, teacher education, and teaching
   culture in these three regions.},

Abstract = {In mathematics education, there is general agreement regarding the
   significance of mathematical literacy (also quantitative literacy or
   numeracy) for informed citizenship, which often requires evaluating the
   use of numbers in public policy discourse. We hold that such an
   evaluation must accommodate the necessarily fragile relation between the
   information that numbers are taken to carry and the policy decisions
   they are meant to support. In doing so, attention needs to be paid to
   differences in how that relation is formed. With this in mind, we
   investigated a public discourse that heavily relied on numbers in the
   context of introducing, maintaining, and easing the rules and
   regulations directed to contain the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2
   during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Germany with its peak in
   early April 2020. We used a public-service broadcasting outlet as data.
   Our theoretical stance is affiliated with post-structuralist discourse
   theory. As an outcome, we identified four major related strategies of
   using numbers, which we named rationalisation, contrast, association and
   recharging. In our view explicit attention to these strategies as well
   as identifying new ones can aid the task of furthering critical
   mathematical literacy.},

Abstract = {Teachers' understanding of the concepts they teach affects the quality
   of instruction and students' learning. This study used a sample of 303
   teachers from across the USA to examine elementary school mathematics
   teachers' knowledge of key concepts underlying fraction arithmetic.
   Teachers' explanations were coded based on the accuracy of their
   explanations and the kinds of concepts and representations they used in
   their responses. The results showed that teachers' understanding of
   fraction arithmetic was limited, especially for fraction division, yet a
   moderate relationship was found between teachers' understanding of
   fraction addition and division. Furthermore, more experienced teachers
   seemed to have a deeper understanding of fraction arithmetic, whereas
   special education teachers had a substantially limited understanding.},

Abstract = {Exploring language provides us with one approach to better understanding
   the practices and beliefs of a community. With advances in
   technology-specifically, computational text processing and machine
   learning tools-we can now examine written language on a large scale. In
   this study, we investigate the language of mathematics teaching and
   learning in the USA over a decade (2009-2018) by analyzing text from
   articles published in Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School. Our
   analyses explore the terminology used by middle school teachers and
   teacher educators to discuss their practice, revealing terms that are
   used widely, terms that have largely been absent from such writing, and
   terms that have shifted in usage over the past decade. This research
   provides insight into the zeitgeist of mathematics teaching and learning
   during a particular period of time, while also suggesting a fruitful
   approach to examining language as a means of uncovering the beliefs and
   practices of a community.},

Abstract = {Affects are intuitively accepted as having a role in the key stages that
   determine success in problem-solving (PS) and problem-posing (PP). Two
   disjoint groups of prospective mathematics teachers with similar
   background and competences have been exposed to PS and PP activities,
   respectively, and they had to describe their affective states during
   these activities. The students' reports have been analyzed from the
   perspective of epistemic affects, motivation, and self-efficacy. While
   in the PS context, several students expressed reluctance to report
   emotional feelings or frustrations over failing to find a solution for
   the given problems, in the PP context, a phenomenon of adaptation to
   one's own cognitive possibilities appeared and the posed problems
   created a state of comfort/ enjoyment in students. PP conveyed a sense
   of autonomy and control to a greater extent than PS. It seems that
   intrinsic motivation is influenced by factors that are different in PP
   vs PS tasks, with an effect on perceived self-efficacy. The PP activity
   instilled a robust sense of coping efficacy, which made the students
   perceive their work as successful, to a large extent. In PS, the
   initially perceived self-efficacy triggered motivation to persevere with
   the solving, while in PP, the initial motivation generated by a novel
   task evolved into students' perceptions of self-efficacy and confidence
   in one's own capabilities. The conclusions of this study can help
   prospective teachers to use emotions in teaching for understanding,
   anticipating, and dealing with students' ideas about mathematics and
   mathematical thinking and, finally, for improving students' self-esteem
   and self-confidence, with an effect in more successful results.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to reveal both the effects of
   problem-posing interventions on the mathematical creative ability of
   students and how students' creative self-efficacy in mathematics was
   related to their mathematical creative ability. Elementary school
   students (n = 205) were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
   problem-posing or control. Results showed the mathematical creativity
   for the problem-posing group increased (p < 0.05) more than for students
   in the control group (d = 0.77). Results from the Confirmatory Factor
   Analysis showed that mathematical creativity was a higher order factor
   that included mathematical creative ability and mathematical creative
   self-efficacy as first-order factors. Among the implications for this is
   that integrating problem-posing activities into elementary school
   mathematics instruction can foster mathematical creativity.},

Abstract = {The multiplicative reasoning that students should develop in elementary
   school is a key area of research in contemporary mathematics education.
   Researchers employ various views including multiplication as arithmetic
   operation, multiplicative structures, and multiplicative relationships.
   They also propose various classifications of multiplicative structures
   to support students' development of multiplicative reasoning and problem
   solving. Our work contributes to this conversation by focusing on simple
   multiplicative relationships. Drawing on Davydov's Theory of
   Developmental Instruction, we employ the relational view to analyze some
   multiplicative structures identified by researchers and practitioners.
   We propose a typology of basic multiplicative relationships as well as
   their specific graphical representations as a set of mental tools
   allowing for a holistic flexible understanding of the multiplicative
   situations, simple and complex, primary school students usually
   encounter (in grades 1-6). We suggest that the new approach may better
   support students' multiplicative and relational reasoning and problem
   solving.},

Title = {The lived experience of linear algebra: a counter-story about women of

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the mathematical sensemaking by women of color in
   the USA as part of the global effort of dismantling deficit narratives
   about historically marginalized groups of students. Following Adiredja's
   anti-deficit framework for sensemaking, this cognitive study invited a
   group of women of color to share their understanding of basis from
   linear algebra to construct a sensemaking counter-story. Extending the
   framework, this study examines a task that explores the boundaries and
   nuances of a concept to support the effort of going beyond students'
   deficits. Eight women extended the concept of basis (and vector spaces)
   to 22 distinct everyday contexts, drawing from their everyday lives as
   well as topics from their academic experiences. Their explanations
   revealed analytical codes describing roles and characteristics of a
   basis. These codes suggest ways that students can mobilize the concept
   of basis beyond its logical underpinnings. Contrasting interpretations
   using a deficit and an anti-deficit perspective construct a
   counter-story that showcases these women's creativity and flexibility in
   understanding the concept, and potential resources for the teaching and
   learning of linear algebra.},

   (ESM) we invited all past and current editors to reflect on the

   of articles from different countries and various attempts editors use to
   address such disparities. The analysis of internal editorial processes
   illustrates how editorial autonomy is exerted and raises questions about
   the necessity for higher editorial accountability, while maintaining the
   necessity of independent scientific judgment. We close the article with
   an open invitation to take up important questions about publication
   processes and their connection to the scholarship that is valued.},

Title = {Domain-specific interpretation of eye tracking data: towards a refined
   use of the eye-mind hypothesis for the field of geometry},

Abstract = {Eye tracking is getting increasingly popular in mathematics education
   research. Studies predominantly rely on the so-called eye-mind
   hypothesis (EMH), which posits that what persons fixate on closely
   relates to what they process. Given that the EMH was developed in
   reading research, we see the risk that implicit assumptions are tacitly
   adopted in mathematics even though they may not apply in this domain.
   This article investigates to what extent the EMH applies in
   mathematicsgeometry in particularand aims to lift the discussion of what
   inferences can be validly made from eye-tracking data. We use a case
   study to investigate the need for a refinement of the use of the EMH. In
   a stimulated recall interview, a student described his original thoughts
   perusing a gaze-overlaid video recorded when he was working on a
   geometry problem. Our findings contribute to better a understanding of
   when and how the EMH applies in the subdomain of geometry. In
   particular, we identify patterns of eye movements that provide valuable
   information on students' geometry problem solving: certain patterns
   where the eye fixates on what the student is processing and others where
   the EMH does not hold. Identifying such patterns may contribute to an
   interpretation theory for students' eye movements in
   geometryexemplifying a domain-specific theory that may reduce the
   inherent ambiguity and uncertainty that eye tracking data analysis has.},

Abstract = {Teachers who engage primary school students in informal statistical
   inference (ISI) must themselves have good content knowledge of ISI
   (ISI-CK). However, little is known about how college education for
   pre-service teachers can contribute to the development of their ISI-CK.
   To address this shortcoming, we used a case study to investigate ISI-CK
   development in a class of 21 pre-service primary school teachers who
   participated in a short intervention (180 min). Based on qualitative and
   quantitative analyses of the pretest, posttest and intervention data,
   the results suggest that most participants acknowledged it is possible
   to make uncertain inferences. An assignment to search the media for
   inferential claims seemed to create awareness regarding inference and
   the need to distinguish between a sample and a population. A simulation
   involving random sampling and varied sample size probably increased the
   participants' knowledge of sampling variability and random sampling. No
   development was seen in the participants' knowledge about sufficient
   sample sizes. The statistical investigation conducted by the
   participants during a model lesson may have strengthened their awareness
   of ISI, but it also revealed that many participants continued to favour
   distributed sampling over random sampling. Further research on belief
   formation with regard to data as evidence, sampling methods and the
   expression of uncertainty in the context of ISI is needed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to better understand the notion of early
   algebraic thinking by describing differences in grade 4-7 students'
   thinking about basic algebraic concepts. To achieve this goal, one test
   that involved generalized arithmetic, functional thinking, and modeling
   tasks, was administered to 684 students from these grades. Quantitative
   analysis of the data yielded four distinct groups of students
   demonstrating a wide range of performance in these tasks. Qualitative
   analysis of students' solutions provided further insight into their
   understanding of basic algebraic concepts, and the nature of the
   processes and forms of reasoning they utilized. The results showed that
   students in each group were able to solve different number and types of
   tasks, using different strategies. Results also indicated that students
   from all grades were present in each group. These findings suggest the
   presence of a consistent trend in the difficulty level across early
   algebraic tasks which may support the existence of a specific
   developmental trend from more intuitive types of early algebraic
   thinking to more sophisticated ones.},

Abstract = {The concept of proof has attracted considerable research attention over
   the pastdecades in part due to its indisputable importance to the
   discipline of mathematics and tostudents' learning of mathematics. Yet,
   the teaching and learning of proof is an instructionallyarduous
   territory, with proof being recognized as a hard-to-teach and
   hard-to-learn concept atall levels of education. Prior research has
   examined, documented, and cast light on theprocesses underpinning
   different problems of classroom practice in the area of proof, buthas
   paid less emphasis on acting upon such problems to generate possible
   solutions throughresearch-based interventions in mathematics classrooms.
   In this Editorial, we first situate thecontributions in this Special
   Issue in a brief chronological account of scholarly work on
   research-based interventions in the area of proof, and we conclude with
   a proposal for somehigh-leverage directions for future research.},

Abstract = {The study reported in this paper concerns the tensions and conflicts
   that teachers experience while they enact a new set of reform-oriented
   curricular materials into their classrooms. Our focus is omicron n the
   interactions developed in two groups of teachers in two schools for a
   period of a school year. We use Activity Theory to study emerging
   contradictions and we elaborate on the construct of dialectical
   opposition to understand the nature of these contradictions and their
   potential for teacher learning. We provide evidence that discussions
   about contradictions and their dialectical character in the two groups
   support teachers to engage differently in mathematics teaching and
   learning and carry potentials for shifts in the practices that evolve in
   their classrooms. Our study addresses empirically in the context of
   mathematics teaching the philosophical claim about the role of
   contradictions as a driving force for any dynamic system.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a study in which we investigated relationships
   between defining mathematical concepts - increasing and decreasing
   infinite sequences - explaining their meanings and classifying
   consistently with formal definitions. We explored the effect of
   defining, explaining or studying a definition on subsequent
   classification, and the effect of classifying on subsequent explaining
   and defining. We report that (1) student-generated definitions and
   explanations were highly variable in content and quality; (2) explicitly
   considering the meaning of the concept facilitated subsequent
   classification, and giving a personal definition or explanation had a
   greater effect than studying a given definition; (3) classifying before
   defining or explaining resulted in significantly poorer definitions and
   explanations. We discuss the implications of these results for the
   teaching of abstract pure mathematics, relating our discussion to
   existing work on the concept image/concept definition distinction and on
   working with examples.},

Abstract = {This special issue comprises five studies which vary in their focus and
   mathematical content, yet they all share an underlying communicational
   theoretical framework-commognition. Within this framework, learning
   mathematics is defined as a change in one's mathematical discourse, that
   is, in the form of communication known as mathematical. Teaching can be
   defined as the communicational activity the motive of which is to bring
   the learners' discourse closer to a canonic discourse. Reading the five
   research articles interconnected via their shared theoretical
   infrastructure has the potential to further develop insights about
   various aspects of teaching and learning mathematics.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine students' development of a
   capacity to maintain doubt, against a backdrop of empirical evidence.
   Specifically, drawing on data from clinical interviews and a series of
   teaching experiments, this paper describes two pathways, the
   Experiential Pathway and the Cultural Non-Experiential Pathway, for the
   development of the mathematical disposition of engaging in skepticism
   towards empirical validations. Issues related to current ways of framing
   students' views of empirical evidence and the role of pragmatic forms of
   doubt are considered.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical model to analyze
   prospective teachers' reasoning and knowledge of real numbers, and to
   provide an empirical verification of it. The model is based on
   Sierpinska's theory of theoretical thinking. Data were collected from 59
   prospective teachers through a written test and interviews. The data
   indicated that mathematical tasks on real numbers, based on Sierpinska's
   theory, could be categorized according to whether they require
   reflective, systemic or analytic thinking. Analysis of the data
   identified three different groups of prospective teachers reflecting
   different types of theoretical thinking about real numbers. The
   interviews confirmed the empirical data from the written test, and
   provided a better insight into the thinking and characteristic features
   of the prospective teachers in each group. The analysis also indicated
   that the participants were more successful in tasks requiring systemic
   and analytic thinking, and only when this was achieved were they able to
   solve problems which required reflective thinking. Implications for
   teaching related to the findings of the study are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we aim to contribute to the discussion of the role of the
   human body and of the concrete artefacts and signs created by humankind
   in the constitution of meanings for mathematical practices. We argue
   that cognition is both embodied and situated in the activities through
   which it occurs and that mathematics learning involves the appropriation
   of practices associated with the sets of artefacts that have
   historically come to represent the body of knowledge we call
   mathematics. This process of appropriation involves a coordination of a
   variety of the semiotic resources-spoken and written languages,
   mathematical representation systems, drawings, gestures and the
   like-through which mathematical objects and relationships might be
   experienced and expressed. To highlight the connections between
   perceptual activities and cultural concepts in the meanings associated
   with this process, we concentrate on learners who do not have access to
   the visual field. More specifically, we present three examples of
   gesture use in the practices of blind mathematics students-all involving
   the exploration of geometrical objects and relationships. On the basis
   of our analysis of these examples, we argue that gestures are
   illustrative of imagined reenactions of previously experienced
   activities and that they emerge in instructional situations as embodied
   abstractions, serving a central role in the sense-making practices
   associated with the appropriation of mathematical meanings.},

   situation. The cognitive background of Vergnaud's approach enriches the
   study of freshmen's processes at university. The mathematical analysis
   and the results specifically underscore the in-action definitions and
   the zero-definitions and highlight the need of similar mathematical
   experiences in education, particularly focused on defining processes and
   the exploration of a research problem.},

Abstract = {The question of how to enhance the learning of low-achieving students in
   mathematics presents an important challenge to researchers and teachers
   alike. We investigated whether and how the use of a contextual story
   presented in a video clip facilitated low-achieving students'
   understanding of the meaning of fraction expansion. To this end, we (a)
   videotaped one group of three such students during a guided interaction
   session, (b) interviewed students and teachers about their first
   impressions of the use of the video clip, and (c) conducted
   pre-post-tests to examine the discourse students choose to employ to
   discuss expansion. Despite the interviewees' impression that the use of
   the video clips makes it easier to remember the story, the analysis of
   the guided interaction session revealed that the students did not use it
   spontaneously when asked to explain why a fraction and its expanded form
   are equivalent. Rather, their explanations revolved around the expansion
   procedure. It was the tutor's careful interventions in the discourse,
   building on the students' recall of the story, which led to a synergy
   effect that facilitated the students' understanding and articulation of
   the meaning of fraction expansion. This combination proved to be a
   potentially successful strategy in effectively promoting low-achieving
   students' understanding in mathematics, as demonstrated in the students'
   discourse and post-test performance. At the same time, our results
   highlight the delicate scaffolding required to achieve a beneficial
   effect.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {75},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of a phenomenon that was observed
   within the dynamic processes of teaching and learning to read and
   elaborate Cartesian graphs for functions at high-school level. Two
   questions were considered during this investigation: What types of
   metaphors does the teacher use to explain the graphic representation of
   functions at high-school level? Is the teacher aware of the use he/she
   has made of metaphors in his/her speech, and to what extent does he/she
   monitor them? The theoretical framework was based on embodied cognition
   theory. Our findings include teachers' expressions that suggest, among
   other ideas: (1) orientation metaphors, such as ``the abscissa axis is
   horizontal{''}; (2) fictive motion, such as ``the graph of a function
   can be considered as the trace of a point that moves over the graph{''};
   (3) ontological metaphors; and (4) interaction of metaphors. We also
   show that teachers were not aware of using metaphors.},

Abstract = {In this research article, I present evidence of the existence of visual
   templates in pattern generalization activity. Such templates initially
   emerged from a 3-week design-driven classroom teaching experiment on
   pattern generalization involving linear figural patterns and were
   assessed for existence in a clinical interview that was conducted four
   and a half months after the teaching experiment using three tasks (one
   ambiguous, two well defined). Drawing on the clinical interviews
   conducted with 11 seventh-and eighth-grade students, I discuss how their
   visual templates have spawned at least six types of algebraic
   generalizations. A visual template model is also presented that
   illustrates the distributed and a dynamically embedded nature of pattern
   generalization involving the following factors: pattern goodness effect;
   knowledge/action effects; and the triad of stage-driven grouping,
   structural unit, and analogy.},

Abstract = {As part of individual interviews incorporating whole number and rational
   number tasks, 323 grade 6 children in Victoria, Australia were asked to
   nominate the larger of two fractions for eight pairs, giving reasons for
   their choice. All tasks were expected to be undertaken mentally. The
   relative difficulty of the pairs was found to be close to that
   predicted, with the exception of fractions with the same numerators and
   different denominators, which proved surprisingly difficult. Students
   who demonstrated the greatest success were likely to use benchmark
   (transitive) and residual thinking. It is hypothesised that the methods
   of these successful students could form the basis of instructional
   approaches which may yield the kind of connected understanding promoted
   in various curriculum documents and required for the development of
   proportional reasoning in later years.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {Many studies have reported on the economical, social, and educational
   difficulties encountered by Ethiopian Jews since their immigration to
   Israel. Furthermore, the overall academic underachievement and poor
   representation of students of Ethiopian origin (SEO) in the advanced
   mathematics and science classes were highlighted and described. Yet,
   studies focusing on differential achievements within SEO and on students
   who succeed against all odds are scarce. In this study, we explored
   success stories of five SEO studying in a pre-academic program at a
   prestigious technological university in Israel. Our goal was to
   understand how these students frame and interpret their success in
   mathematics and to identify elements perceived as fostering their
   mathematics and academic trajectories. Using qualitative methodology, we
   identified perceived personal motivational variables, effective learning
   and coping strategies, and students' immediate environment as key
   elements contributing to achieving and maintaining success. We discuss
   possible theoretical contributions and practical implications of the
   findings.},

Abstract = {This is a theoretical article proposing a way of organizing and
   structuring the discussion of why and how to use the history of
   mathematics in the teaching and learning of mathematics, as well as the
   interrelations between the arguments for using history and the
   approaches to doing so. The way of going about this is to propose two
   sets of categories in which to place the arguments for using history
   (the ``whys{''}) and the different approaches to doing this (the
   ``hows{''}). The arguments for using history are divided into two
   categories; history as a tool and history as a goal. The ways of using
   history are placed into three categories of approaches: the
   illumination, the modules, and the history-based approaches. This
   categorization, along with a discussion of the motivation for using
   history being one concerned with either the inner issues (in-issues) or
   the metaperspective issues (meta-issues) of mathematics, provides a
   means of ordering the discussion of ``whys{''} and ``hows.{''}},

Abstract = {Spontaneous gesture produced in conjunction with speech is considered as
   both a source of data about mathematical thinking, and as an integral
   modality in communication and cognition. The analysis draws on a corpus
   of more than 200 gestures collected during 3 h of interviews with
   prospective elementary school teachers on the topic of fractions. The
   analysis examines how gestures express meaning, utilizing the framework
   of cognitive linguistics to argue that gestures are both composed of,
   and provide inputs to, conceptual blends for mathematical ideas, and a
   standard typology drawn from gesture studies is extended to address the
   function of gestures within mathematics more appropriately.},

Title = {Meaning and subjectivity in the PISA mathematics frameworks: a
   sociological approach},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 29},
Abstract = {Social institutions function not only by reproducing specific practices
   but also by reproducing discourses endowing such practices with meaning.
   The latter in turn is related to the development of the identities or
   subjectivities of those who live and thrive within such institutions.
   Meaning and subjectivity are therefore significant sociological
   categories involved in the functioning of complex social phenomena such
   as that of mathematical instruction. The present paper provides a
   discursive analysis centered on these categories of the influential
   OECD's PISA mathematics frameworks. As we shall see, meaning as
   articulated by the OECD primarily stresses the utilitarian value of
   mathematics to individuals and to society at large. Furthermore, molding
   students' subjectivities towards endorsing such articulation of meaning
   is emphasized as an educational objective, either explicitly or
   implicitly, as connected to the OECD's definition of mathematical
   literacy. Therefore, the OECD's discourses do not only serve to
   reproduce the type of mathematical instruction implied in the
   organization's services concerning education, but also concomitantly
   provide a potentially most effective educational technology through
   which the demand of these very services may be reproduced.},

Abstract = {This paper describes how the notion of the strongly didactic contract
   can serve to characterize the teaching adopted to implement a task in
   probability. It is particularly focused on the reality of mathematical
   work performed by students and teachers. For this research, classroom
   sessions were developed in an in-service teacher training course
   designed (and adapted) according to the Japanese Lesson Study model.
   Through the combined use of the Theory of Didactical Situations (TDS)
   and the Theory of Mathematical Working Spaces (ThMWS), a coding of the
   sessions observed was developed. Based on this coding, different
   patterns emerged which gave each session a specific rhythm and identity
   from which it was possible to recognize and characterize different
   strongly didactic contracts. The study highlights the difference between
   the potential contracts intended by the teachers and those observed in
   practice. The tools, and especially the coding, developed for the study
   could be used for future research on instructional situations or
   in-service teacher training.},

   defining own equivalences},

Abstract = {The presented article is dedicated to a new way of teaching substitution
   in algebra. In order to effectively master the subject matter, it is
   necessary for students to perceive the equal sign equivalently, to learn
   to manipulate expressions as objects, and to perceive and use
   transformations based on defining their own equivalences. According to
   the results of several researches, these changes do not occur
   automatically, and the neglect of their development leads to students'
   insufficient adoption of substitution. The submitted contribution
   presents a new way of teaching substitution, the stages of which support
   the gradual development of the necessary competences of students, so
   that substitution becomes part of their computing apparatus. The
   effectiveness of the mentioned method of teaching substitution was also
   verified experimentally. By conducting a pedagogical experiment, it was
   confirmed that the application of the substitution teaching method
   developed by us led to more frequent use of substitution by students
   from the experimental group (47 students) compared to students from the
   control group (82 students) who learned substitution in the usual way.
   It emerged from the interview with experimental group students that they
   considered the proposed method suitable and that it encouraged them to
   learn substitution in depth.},

Abstract = {Teacher self-efficacy beliefs, epistemological beliefs, and beliefs
   about teaching with technology are regarded as crucial factors for
   teaching mathematics with technology. However, there is a lack of
   research that investigates these beliefs while taking into account the
   multidimensionality of the constructs. In this cross-sectional study
   with n = 198 upper secondary in-service teachers in Germany, we used
   multidimensional scales to measure teachers' i) beliefs about teaching
   with technology, ii) self-efficacy beliefs, and iii) epistemological
   beliefs. Furthermore, teachers were asked to self-report on their iv)
   implementation of technology with respect to different modes of
   technology use. The results uncover differential associations among the
   constructs and identify sub-dimensions that are especially central. In
   particular, three clusters of sub-dimensions can be reconstructed. One
   cluster reflects a broader set of sub-dimensions and is related to a
   more integrated and constructivist implementation of technology. In this
   cluster, self-efficacy can be identified as a central construct. A
   further cluster is related to using technology to support multiple
   representations which turned out to be independent of many other
   sub-dimensions. Finally, the third cluster comprises sub-dimension that
   can be interpreted as less central. This cluster in particular contains
   teachers' beliefs about the detrimental effects of teaching with
   technology, which points out that beliefs about the risks of technology
   use are less central than beliefs about the potential benefits of
   technology. The results can inform more differentiated approaches to
   teacher professional development related to teaching mathematics with
   technology.},

Abstract = {In 2020, the emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic brought a drastic
   and sudden change in teaching practices, from the physical space of the
   classrooms to the virtual space of an e-environment. In this paper,
   through a qualitative analysis of 44 collected essays composed by
   Italian mathematics teachers from primary school to undergraduate level
   during the spring of 2020, we investigate how the Italian teachers
   perceived the changes due to the unexpected transition from a
   face-to-face setting to distance education. The analysis is carried out
   through a double theoretical lens, one concerning the whole didactic
   system where the knowledge at stake is mathematics and the other
   regarding affective aspects. The integration of the two theoretical
   perspectives allows us to identify key elements and their relations in
   the teachers' narratives and to analyze how teachers have experienced
   and perceived the dramatic, drastic, and sudden change. The analysis
   shows the process going from the disruption of the educational setting
   to the teachers' discovery of key aspects of the didactic system
   including the teacher's roles, a reflection on mathematics and its
   teaching, and the attempt to reconstruct the didactic system in a new
   way.},

Abstract = {Drawing on Bourdieu's theory of social and cultural reproduction, this
   article utilizes the conceptual tools of habitus and cultural capital to
   examine intergenerational inequalities in attitudes towards mathematics
   and mathematics learning in three secondary schools in England. Data
   from 1079 students aged 14-16 included mathematics achievement, survey
   measures of attitudes towards mathematics, perceived parental attitudes
   towards mathematics, newly developed scales for cultural capital and
   habitus, and social class. There was a very strong relationship between
   student's attitudes towards mathematics and students' perceptions of
   their parents' attitudes towards mathematics. Middle-class students
   reported more positive attitudes towards mathematics, more positive
   perceived parental attitudes towards mathematics, and had higher
   mathematics achievement than working-class students. Cultural capital
   had a significant positive effect on students' attitudes towards
   mathematics but a minor effect on their achievement in mathematics.
   However, cultural capital's effect on students' attitudes and
   achievement in mathematics faded when habitus was included in the model.
   We suggest that habitus may play a more central role than cultural
   capital in the reproduction of mathematics inequalities. School quality
   had a modest but significant impact on mathematics outcomes in this
   study, so we argue that challenges to mathematics inequalities will
   require changes both within and outside of mathematics classrooms.},

Abstract = {This study examined how expert and novice (preservice) teachers solved
   mathematical modelling tasks as well as how they noticed written
   artifacts of student thinking that were in response to the mathematical
   modelling tasks. Some teachers in both groups were aware of the openness
   and underdetermination of the modelling tasks and that these
   characteristics implied that underlying assumptions needed to be made in
   order to solve the tasks. Indeed, nearly all of the expert teachers
   addressed the need to make assumptions for the Seashell Task. When
   examining student work, both expert and preservice teachers interpreted
   positive aspects in the students' solutions and provided feedback to
   students. However, almost all of the expert teachers responded by asking
   questions, whereas around a third of preservice teachers directly
   corrected students' mistakes and another third pointed out mistakes
   without correcting them. This study provides a new angle to study
   teachers' mathematical competencies, the assessment of modelling
   competencies, and considerations for the development of teachers'
   modelling competencies.},

Abstract = {Feedback provided by mathematics teachers usually addresses procedural
   skills and, to a much lesser extent, other competencies such as
   conceptual understanding or engagement in mathematical practices. As
   most previous literature has studied feedback provided on homework or
   video prompts, how teachers provide such feedback in the classroom is
   poorly understood. Here, sixteen lessons taught by five teachers were
   purposefully sampled from a larger video study (172 lessons) as lessons
   with high-quality feedback according to a standardized observation
   instrument. The analysis focused on the instructional situations in
   which teachers provided feedback. When teachers provided procedural
   feedback, the situations were orderly and effective. Feedback on
   conceptual understanding and mathematical practices was provided in
   situations when students were especially challenged, and entailed a
   series of complex decisions, thereby placing demands on the teachers to
   manage both the students' understanding and behavior. We argue that
   researchers should focus on how teachers and students negotiate the
   instructional situation to allow for feedback on conceptual
   understanding or mathematical practices.},

Abstract = {One can identify at least three different types of relationships between
   mathematics and crises. First, mathematics can picture a crisis. This is
   in accordance with the classic interpretation of mathematical modelling,
   which highlights that a mathematical model provides a representation of
   a piece of reality, a reality that could be a critical situation such
   as, for instance, a pandemic. Second, mathematics can constitute a
   crisis, meaning that mathematics can form an intrinsic part of the very
   dynamics of a crisis. This phenomenon can be illustrated by the economic
   crises that spread around the world in 2008. Third, mathematics can
   format a crisis. This final formulation refers to a situation where a
   mathematical reading of a crisis brings about ways of acting in the
   critical situation that might be adequate, but also counterproductive,
   if not catastrophic. This is illustrated with reference to the potential
   crises due to climate changes. As a conclusion, the paper addresses the
   politics of crises, which refers to the power that can be acted out
   through a crisis discourse in which mathematics may come to play a
   deplorable role.},

Abstract = {This study explored the relationships between task beliefs about the
   empty number line (ENL), mathematical ability, gender, and voluntary ENL
   use in multi-digit subtraction and addition. One hundred twenty-three
   Dutch third-grade students and nine teachers from six schools
   participated in this study. The multilevel path analysis showed that
   task beliefs about the ENL mediated the relationship between students'
   mathematical ability and their voluntary ENL use. No gender differences
   were found in the multilevel path analysis. Finally, the results show
   that task beliefs about the ENL and voluntary ENL use differed across
   classrooms. The discussion focuses on the implications of the results
   for using the ENL in diagnostic assessment.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how in-service teachers enrolled in a graduate proof
   course interpret, understand, and use generic examples as part of their
   proving and justification activities. Generic examples, which are
   capable of proving and justifying with strong explanatory power, are
   particularly important for teachers considering teaching proof in their
   classrooms. The teachers in our study used generic examples to produce
   three types of proof: example-based arguments enhanced with generic
   language; incomplete generic examples; and complete generic examples. We
   found that teachers conflate generic examples and visual
   representations, prefer visual generic examples for teaching, and
   consider a generic example with symbolic representation to be more
   convincing than a generic example without. We conclude with implications
   for secondary school teaching, as well as suggestions for future
   professional development efforts.},

Abstract = {We are developing an approach to teaching important
   proportionality-based concepts to first grade students in a way that
   supports students' future progress in the domain. We consider the
   proportionality between magnitudes as a basic relationship behind
   multiple cases, usually described mathematically as ratio or rate. The
   core of our strategy is the modelling of a situation of proportionality
   and its transformations by creating a compound unit. The key action is
   coordinated measurement (co-measurement): students work in pairs, and
   each student is in charge of changing one of two magnitudes, while
   preserving proportionality. Based on our successful experiments in
   Grades 2-6, we incorporate shared responsibility work organization
   ({''}joint actions{''}) and the idea of compound unit into Davydov's
   mathematics curriculum for the first grade. We built a new module based
   on Davydov's idea about the role of rule-mediated counting by sets. In
   this paper, we present the results of our study, showing that first
   graders can learn the idea of compound unit and work with two magnitudes
   of different kinds while preserving proportionality.},

Title = {Beyond quality metrics: defying journal rankings as the philosopher's
   stone of mathematics education research},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {In recent years, the field of mathematics education has witnessed the
   emergence of several journal rankings. Within these rankings,
   Ibero-American journals have had little-to almost no-presence. This
   raises awareness on the current state of journal indexes and on what
   these indexes do and how they have been used in constituting sites of
   exclusion within the mathematics education community. We contend that
   ranking systems are perceived as the philosopher's stone of academia, in
   the sense that they have the ability to convert any material (an
   article, a journal, the academic production of a scholar) into a
   precious material within the academic world. This alchemic move not only
   exacerbates exclusion, but also configures a point system that
   constitutes places for enjoyment and fetishistic disavowal within
   researchers. Thus, we want to challenge the assumption that mainstream
   journal rankings are able to accurately reflect the quality, impact, and
   reputation of mathematics education journals by taking as ``empirical
   data{''} the Ibero-American journals in the field of mathematics
   education. In problematizing journal ranking effects in the production,
   dissemination, and socialization of knowledge, we seek to open a
   discussion regarding the economic-political dynamics that govern
   publishing practices in mathematics education and that are entangled in
   the production of knowledge in our discipline.},

   scaling up: the case of supporting low-achieving middle school students},

Abstract = {In order to better facilitate scaling up of classroom innovations, two
   complementary strategies have often been discussed. The community-based
   strategy emphasizes the necessity for professional learning communities
   and their embedding in institutional settings. The material-based
   strategy starts from well-designed teaching materials, which are
   considered catalysts for bringing teaching approaches to many
   classrooms. The implementation project reported on in this study
   systematically combines both strategies and takes a third strategy into
   account: the systemic strategy of addressing higher levels of the school
   system, such as the school and district levels. The goal of the project
   is to help teachers to better support low-achieving students at the
   beginning of German secondary schools (grades 5 and 6). The results of
   the accompanying research in a quasi-experimental study, reported in
   this article, show that a combination of strategies can be effective:
   the participating low-achieving students had higher learning gains than
   a control group did. The deeper analysis provides insights into the
   complexities of the interplay of community aspects, institutional
   backgrounds, and the power of substantial teaching materials.},

Title = {Microgenetic analysis of young children's shifts of attention in

Abstract = {A key aim of mathematics teaching is for children to develop appropriate
   and efficient strategies for solving tasks. The analysis presented in
   this paper moves beyond the exploration of changes in the strategies
   that children employ to solve tasks and extends to observation and
   exploration of changes that occur when their overall solving approach
   remains seemingly stable. We present an analysis of data from two
   qualitative studies, each of which combined a microgenetic design with
   task-based interviews, to examine changes that occur in 5-6-year-old
   children's verbal reports when solving an additive task, and in
   9-10-year-old children's verbal reports when solving fraction word
   problems. Children's verbal reports were analysed through the lens of
   the theory of shifts of attention. We found that phases of stability are
   underlain by dynamic changes in how the same strategy is communicated
   and conceptualised over a number of sessions and these changes appear to
   be accounted for by changes related to shifts in the object and
   structure of children's attention, i.e. what children attend to and how,
   when reporting on their solving approach. The paper extends the theory
   by revealing and studying microqualities that underlie different
   learners' structure of attention during phases of stability in
   arithmetic tasks. The findings provide new, significant insights for
   understanding qualitative dynamics of change in learning. Sensitivity to
   differences and changes in learners' shifts of attention is essential
   for teachers to make sense of what learners experience and identify
   opportunities conducive to further learning.},

Abstract = {The aims of this article are to document the types of signs that young
   children make to represent their mathematical thinking, and to determine
   the extent to which features of usage-based language acquisition are
   evident in children's early graphical communications made in
   mathematical contexts. Studies of young children's symbolic principles
   in ontogeny and research into the acquisition and development of
   language provide insights into the rich foundational knowledge on which
   they build their early mathematical inscriptions. The study conceives of
   children's mathematical abstractions as emergent cognitive
   representations, originating in their need to communicate within
   personally meaningful contexts. The collected ethnographic data comprise
   mathematical inscriptions from seven children aged three to four years
   in their nursery school and written observations from their teachers and
   the first researcher. Analysis follows an interpretive, social-semiotic
   paradigm; the inscriptions were analysed to show how they convey their
   emerging mathematical understandings, and how this supports their
   emergent abstractions. The findings illuminate children's strategies as
   they communicate their thinking, indicating the importance of symbolic
   number knowledge in acquiring the abstract graphical language of
   mathematics.},

Abstract = {To assess the strength of conceptual understanding of number sense, a
   three-tier number sense test (TTNST) for fifth-grade students was
   developed and validated in this study. The three-tier test includes a
   content tier that assesses content knowledge of number sense, a reason
   tier that assesses a reason given for selecting a first-tier response,
   and a confidence tier that assesses how confident fifth-grade students
   are in their responses in the first two tiers. A total of 819
   fifth-grade students from elementary schools in Taiwan participated in
   this study. Collected data showed that the test had good reliability and
   validity. The results revealed that many of the sample students
   performed poorly on number sense but maintained extremely high
   confidence; this indicated that many of the students held severe
   misconceptions and some were lacking in number sense. In addition, this
   study confirmed that the inclusion of a third tier (with confidence
   ratings) in the number sense test can mitigate the weaknesses of a
   previously used two-tier test. The educational implications of the
   findings are discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {This special issue comprises seven studies and a commentary piece, which
   relate to various aspects of rituals and the ritual-exploration dyad in
   learning, teaching and learning-to-teach mathematics. The theme of the
   special issue arose from Sfard and Lavie's (Cognition and Instruction,
   23(2), 237-309, 2005) ritual vs. explorative dyad, on which a Working
   Session was held during the PME conference in 2016. Three central themes
   are addressed in the papers of this special issue: (1) the logic of
   ritual, and why rituals are so persistent in mathematics classrooms; (2)
   the co-existence of rituals and explorations, including the question of
   whether rituals and explorations are a binary or a continuum; and (3)
   alternative theoretical conceptualisations of the ritual-exploration
   dyad, focusing in particular on what can be learned about rituals from
   social and critical theory, as well as socio-linguistics. In this
   introduction, we first give an overview of each of the papers and its
   unique contribution. We then synthesise the answers given by the papers
   to the three themes described above.},

Abstract = {In this design experiment study, we investigated the problem: What
   conditions might foster students' discernment of a critical
   aspect-variation in unidirectional change (e.g., discerning a
   ``decreasing{''} increase)? At a public middle school in a large US
   city, we led a sequence of three days of whole class lessons, followed
   by task-based, clinical interviews with 14 seventh grade students
   (similar to 13 years old). Students interacted with researcher-developed
   dynamic computer environments, which linked filling polygon animations
   with dynamic graphs. We report results to demonstrate a range of
   students' work along with detailed analyses of student interview
   episodes. We found connections between students' predictions of graph
   type (linear, ``mostly{''} linear, nonlinear), students' conceptions of
   attributes represented by a graph, and students' discernment of
   variation in unidirectional change. Students who discerned variation in
   unidirectional change also engaged in quantitative variational
   reasoning. To foster students' discernment of variation in
   unidirectional change, task designers should provide opportunities for
   students to conceive of attributes as capable of varying and possible to

Abstract = {Middle school students have been pervasively described in the research
   literature as exhibiting disaffection, disengagement, and a lack of
   interest in mathematics classrooms. This study investigated this notion
   empirically using students' own voice on their wishes for mathematics
   learning to see if they characterise themselves in this way in their
   self-reports. Over 3500 Australian middle school students responded to a
   free-format prompt and reported diverse but overwhelmingly positive
   aspirations related to intrinsic motivational features inherent in their
   disposition and to extrinsic factors in their environment, such as the
   learning context and activities provided. Evidence of all four goal
   orientations was found in the students' responses but most noticeably
   for the productive mastery-approach orientation. When these students
   described what they wish for in their mathematics classrooms, they
   mentioned challenging work, interesting work, and opportunities to
   collaborate.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore the beliefs of elementary school
   students about mathematics and about themselves as mathematics learners.
   The participants, Israeli grade 4 and grade 6 students, completed
   questionnaires. Using an ``animal metaphor{''} to tap beliefs, some
   students perceived mathematics as difficult and complicated, while for
   others, mathematics was connected to wisdom. The data from other
   questionnaire items indicated that students at both grade levels
   generally did not enjoy learning mathematics, but believed it was very
   important to study this subject. They also believed that they were good
   at mathematics, but the grade 6 students' self-perceptions of
   achievement were lower than those of the grade 4 students. Compared to
   the boys, the girls in both grades 4 and 6 expressed lower perceptions
   of their mathematics achievement levels.},

Abstract = {Studies on identity in general and mathematical identity in particular
   have gained much interest over the last decades. However, although
   measurements have been proven to be potent tools in many scientific
   fields, a lack of consensus on ontological, epistemological, and
   methodological issues has complicated measurements of mathematical
   identities. Specifically, most studies conceptualise mathematical
   identity as something multidimensional and situated, which obviously
   complicates measurement, since these aspects violate basic requirements
   of measurement. However, most concepts that are measured in scientific
   work are both multidimensional and situated, even in physics. In effect,
   these concepts are being conceptualised as sufficiently uni-dimensional
   and invariant for measures to be meaningful. We assert that if the same
   judgements were to be made regarding mathematical identity, that is,
   whether identity can be measured with one instrument alone, whether one
   needs multiple instruments, or whether measurement is meaningless, it
   would be necessary to know how much of the multidimensionality can be
   captured by one measure and how situated mathematical identity is.
   Accordingly, this paper proposes a theoretical perspective on
   mathematical identity that is consistent with basic requirements of
   measurement. Moreover, characteristics of students' mathematical
   identities are presented and the problem of ``situatedness{''} is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This study examines the classroom practice and craft knowledge
   underpinning one teacher's integration of the use of GeoGebra software
   into mathematics teaching. The chosen teacher worked in an English
   secondary school and was professionally well regarded as an accomplished
   user of digital technology in mathematics teaching. Designed in
   accordance with the Structuring Features of Classroom Practice framework
   (Ruthven, 2009), the study triangulates evidence from lesson
   observations and post-lesson interviews to analyse how this teacher's
   classroom practice and professional knowledge support the integration of
   technology. This analysis shows how the teacher managed a number of
   aspects of classroom teaching related to using GeoGebra such as
   including technology-mediated tasks aligned with his pedagogical goals,
   preparing his students to use the technology efficiently, adapting
   formats for classroom activity and extending his curriculum scripts for
   the topics studied.},

Abstract = {Reversibility of concepts, a key aspect of mathematical development, is
   often problematic for learners. In this theoretical paper, we present a
   typology we have developed for categorizing the different reverse
   concepts that can be related to a particular initial concept and
   explicate the relationship among these different reverse concepts. We
   discuss uses of the typology and how reversibility can be understood as
   the result of reflective abstraction. Finally, we describe two
   strategies for promoting reversibility that have distinct uses in terms
   of the types of reverse concepts they engender. We share empirical
   results which led to our postulation of these strategies and discuss
   their theoretical basis.},

Title = {Growing-making mathematics: a dynamic perspective on people, materials,

Abstract = {Recent theoretical advances on learning (mathematics) emphasize the fact
   that what results from engagement with curriculum materials is not
   entirely in the control of the students in the way classical theories of
   knowing and learning suggest. These new theories distinguish themselves
   by either invoking distributed agency, some of which is attributed to
   non-human aspects of the environment, or by emphasizing the essential
   (radical) passivity that characterizes coming to know. In this study, an
   alternative is offered: making as a modality of growing. This move
   allows us to capture theoretically that both growers-makers and their
   materials grow (old) together. The proposed approach troubles existing
   ones because it shifts our perspective from a transitive relation
   between students and the curricular objects to an intransitive one,
   where the becoming of each is described in terms of Deleuzian lines of
   flight. A case study involving two girls and tangram pieces is described
   in terms of growing together and becoming-hexagon. Implications are
   discussed for how researchers can capture the non-agential, non-causal
   dimensions of coming to know.},

Abstract = {This special issue of Educational Studies in Mathematics, developed from
   the Mathematics Education and Contemporary Theory (MECT) conferences in
   Manchester, U.K., follows up an earlier double special issue in Volume
   80 (2012) of this journal, which comprised 18 papers authored from a
   dozen countries. These efforts-both in conference and in print-to
   develop theory in and for mathematics education should be seen as part
   of our community's collective effort to offer mathematics education
   broader yet more rigorous ``thinking tools{''}. We argue in this
   introduction that in these times where ideology so often defines
   ``improvement{''} in preference to rigorous analysis, this effort is
   more important than ever before. The selected papers span two broad
   areas: theory is used to develop critical conceptual frameworks for
   studies in mathematics education by Llewellyn, Nolan, Barwell, Nardi,
   Pais; and philosophical dimensions of mathematical learning are
   discussed by Ernest, Skovsmose, and Boylan.},

Title = {Schooling novice mathematics teachers on structures and strategies: a

   practices},

Abstract = {School discursive practices produce and reproduce acceptable notions of
   the good mathematics teacher, thereby shaping identity and agency in
   becoming a teacher. In this paper, I draw on key aspects of Bourdieu's
   social field theory-his conceptual ``thinking tools{''} and his
   reflexive sociology-to explore the relations and discourses of school
   mathematics classrooms as experienced by two novice secondary
   mathematics teachers. Presentation and analysis of interview transcript
   data, juxtaposed with fictional ``dear novice teacher{''} letters from
   the field, reveal the ways in which the two novice mathematics teachers
   carefully negotiate space for enacting agency amid institutional school
   ``others.{''} The reflections in this paper are made relevant for
   mathematics teacher education through a better understanding of novice
   mathematics teacher agency, including an account of how these two
   teachers are being ``schooled{''} on the structures and strategies of
   classroom practices. An additional contribution of this paper to theory
   in mathematics education lies in the approach to analysis that draws on
   Bourdieu's reflexive sociology, specifically the concept of a field of
   opinion, to introduce competing discourses offered by novice teachers in
   mathematics classrooms and by teacher educators/researchers in teacher
   education programs.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore algebra students' mathematical realities
   around fractions and division, and the ways in which students reinvented
   mathematical productions involving fractions and division. We find that
   algebra students' initial realities do not include the
   fraction-as-quotient sub-construct. This can be problematic because in
   algebra, quotients are almost always represented as fractions. In a
   design experiment, students progressively reinvented the
   fraction-as-quotient sub-construct. Analyzing this experiment, we find
   that a particular type of mathematical production, which we call
   preformal productions, played two meditational roles: (1) they mediated
   mathematical activity, and (2) they mediated the reinvention of more
   formal mathematical productions. We suggest that preformal productions
   may emerge even when they are not designed for, and we show how
   preformal productions embody historic classroom activity and social
   interaction.},

Abstract = {A theoretical reflection on epistemology is presented. The important
   role of epistemological analysis in research in mathematics education is
   discussed. I analyze the epistemological evolution as a consequence of
   the changes in the mathematical culture and demonstrate how the
   epistemological analysis is tightly linked to the cultural dimension.
   Then I analyze the connection between epistemology and networking of
   theories. Different meanings of the word ``epistemic{''} are observed as
   well as the role of epistemology in the networking of theories.},

Abstract = {For mathematicians, definitions are the ultimate tool for reaching
   agreement about the nature and properties of mathematical objects. As
   research in school mathematics has revealed, however, mathematics
   learners are often reluctant, perhaps even unable, to help themselves
   with definitions while categorizing mathematical objects. In the
   research from which we take the data presented in this article, we have
   been following a group of prospective mathematics teachers studying
   functions. In the course of learning, the students gradually accepted
   the definition as the ultimate criterion to identify examples of
   function. And yet, this use was hindered by the difficulty the students
   experienced while trying to understand the logical structure of the
   definition. Our close analysis has shown that the determiners ``for
   every{''} and ``unique{''} constituted the main source of the
   difficulty. We propose that a brief introduction to logic and, in
   particular, to parsing complex mathematical sentences, may be a useful
   addition to mathematics curriculum.},

Abstract = {Although mathematical practice has traditionally valued two distinct
   kinds of mathematical work-referred to by Gowers (2000) as theory
   building and problem solving-activity in classrooms appears to be
   organized largely around the latter, rather than the former. This study
   takes up the question of whether there is a customary role for theory
   building in the secondary geometry course and to what extent teachers of
   geometry hold students accountable for that disposition. We analyze
   records from study groups composed of experienced geometry teachers in
   the USA, and ask to what extent the disposition towards theory building
   is visible in those records, and how teachers react to the suggestion
   that it could play a larger role in their practice. Among our findings,
   we report that participants consistently attached a higher value to work
   organized around problem solving, rejecting the idea that they might
   hold their students accountable for theory building.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to explore the educative power of an experienced
   mathematics teacher educator-researcher (MTE-R) who displayed his
   insights and strategies in teacher professional development (TPD)
   programs. To this end, we propose a framework by first conceptualizing
   educative power based on three constructs-communication, reasoning, and
   connection-and then we extend the conceptualization with another two
   dimensions: the reciprocal facilitator-learner relationships involving
   educators, teachers, and students, as well as a bridge between research
   and practice. Based on both self-study and case-study approaches, we
   further elaborate features specific to the MTE-R's educative power which
   includes communication using an approach of creating educative
   phenomenology, reasoning by mapping teachers' ideas onto emergent models
   to solve problems in educative challenges, and connection between
   research and practice by coordination. In particular, the core of the
   educative power that supported the MTE-R to initiate at-the-moment
   actions was his insights into the essence of mathematics, and the
   learning of students and teachers. We believe that the conceptual
   framework in this study offers a powerful tool that could guide the
   analyses of educative power, especially for those studies related to the
   initiation of at-the-moment actions and the implementation of TPD
   programs.},

Abstract = {A teaching experiment-using Mathematica to investigate the convergence
   of sequence of functions visually as a sequence of objects (graphs)
   converging onto a fixed object (the graph of the limit function)-is here
   used to analyze how the approach can support the dynamic blending of
   visual and symbolic representations that has the potential to lead to
   the formal definition of the concept of limit. The study is placed in a
   broad context that links the historical development with cognitive
   development and has implications in the use of technology to blend
   dynamic perception and symbolic operation as a natural basis for formal
   mathematical reasoning. The approach offered in this study stimulated
   explicit discussion not only of the relationship between the potential
   infinity of the process and the actual infinity of the limit but also of
   the transition from the Taylor polynomials as approximations to a
   desired accuracy towards the formal definition of limit. At the end of
   the study, a wide spectrum of conceptions remained. Some students only
   allowed finite computations as approximations and denied actual
   infinity, but for half of the students involved in the study, the
   infinite sum of functions was perceived as a legitimate ``object{''} and
   was not perceived as a dynamic ``process{''} that passes through a
   potentially infinite number of terms. For some students, the legitimate
   object was vague or generic, but we also observed other students
   developing a sense of the formal limit concept.},

Title = {Subjectivity and cultural adjustment in mathematics education: a
   response to Wolff-Michael Roth},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {80},
Number = {3},
Pages = {475-490},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this volume, Wolff-Michael Roth provides a critical but partial
   reading of Tony Brown's book Mathematics Education and Subjectivity. The
   reading contrasts Brown's approach with Roth's own conception of
   subjectivity as derived from the work of Vygotsky, in which Roth aims to
   ``reunite{''} psychology and sociology. Brown's book, however, focuses
   on how discourses in mathematics education shape subjective action
   within a Lacanian model that circumnavigates both ``psychology{''} and
   ``sociology{''}. From that platform, this paper responds to Roth through
   problematising the idea of the individual as a subjective entity in
   relation to the two perspectives, with some consideration of
   corporeality and of how the Symbolic encounters the Real. The paper
   argues for a Lacanian conception of subjectivity for mathematics
   education comprising a response to a social demand borne of an
   ever-changing symbolic order that defines our constitution and our space
   for action. The paper concludes by considering an attitude to the
   production of research objects in mathematics education research that
   resists the normalisation of assumptions as to how humans encounter
   mathematics.},

Title = {Teaching children how to include the inversion principle in their

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {79},

Abstract = {The basis of this intervention study is a distinction between numerical
   calculus and relational calculus. The former refers to numerical
   calculations and the latter to the analysis of the quantitative
   relations in mathematical problems. The inverse relation between
   addition and subtraction is relevant to both kinds of calculus, but so
   far research on improving children's understanding and use of the
   principle of inversion through interventions has only been applied to
   the solving of a + b -aEuro parts per thousand b = ? sums. The main aim
   of the intervention described in this article was to study the effects
   of teaching children about the explicit use of inversion as part of the
   relational calculus needed to solve inverse addition and subtraction
   problems using a calculator. The study showed that children taught about
   relational calculus differed significantly from those who were taught
   numerical procedures, and also that effects of the intervention were
   stronger when children were taught about relational calculus with
   mixtures of indirect and direct word problems than when these two types
   of problem were given to them in separate blocks.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the development and problematization of a task
   designed to foster spatial visual sense in prospective and practicing
   elementary and middle school teachers. We describe and analyse the
   cyclical stages of developing, testing, and modifying several ``task
   drafts{''} related to ideas around dilation and proportion. Challenged
   by participant non-actions and non-responses, we as task designers
   identified and anticipated sources of difficulties, which motivated
   repeated modification of the task to further the intended learning
   goals. The task in its present form incorporates numerous considerations
   including choices around materials, wording of questions and prompts,
   and sequencing of experiences. It also reflects our enriched
   understanding of exploration strategies and the roles of manipulatives
   and technology in spatial visual tasks designed for adult learners.},

Abstract = {This paper is an attempt to add to the foundation of our understanding
   of meaning making in mathematics education. This attempt seems to be
   necessary as a growing body of research, primarily in developmental

   Empathy, reciprocity, and implicit understanding seem to be more
   suitable concepts to describe human development and learning than the
   ones previously employed, based, e.g., on aggression as natural instinct
   or competitiveness as genetically wired basic drive.},

Abstract = {Representation is viewed as central to mathematical problem solving.
   Yet, it is becoming obvious that students are having difficulty
   negotiating the various forms and functions of representations. This
   article examines the functions that representation has in students'
   mathematical problem solving and how that compares to its function in
   the problem solving of experts and broadly in mathematics. Overall, this
   work highlights the close connections between the work of experts and
   students, showing how students use representations in ways that are
   inherently similar to those of experts. Both experts and students use
   representations as tools towards the understanding, exploration,
   recording, and monitoring of problem solving. In social contexts,
   experts and students use representations for the presentation of their
   work but also the negotiation and co-construction of shared
   understandings. However, this research also highlights where students'
   work departs from experts' representational practices, hence, providing
   some directions for pedagogy and further work.},

Abstract = {According to theoretical concepts like constructivism, each learner has
   to build up knowledge on his or her own. The learner creates hypotheses
   in order to explain `facts'. Hypotheses do not guarantee certainty. They
   have to be verified. In this article, a theoretical framework will be
   presented which can help to understand and analyse the processes of
   creativity and reasoning. Peirce's theory of abduction plays a decisive
   role in this framework. He elaborated abduction as the third elementary
   inference, besides deduction and induction. While abduction will be used
   to describe and analyse the process of discovering an explanatory
   hypothesis, deduction, induction and their combinations will be used to
   describe the different processes of verifying knowledge. Theoretical and
   empirical ways of discovering and verifying mathematical coherences will
   be presented and illustrated by fictive and empirical examples.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the nature of the interaction between the
   teacher and students as they worked on different mathematics activities
   in a single classroom over a 10-month period. Sociocultural theories and
   the Vygotskian zone of proximal development provide the main framework
   for examining the teaching and learning processes and explaining the
   incorporation of a four-phase lesson plan as increasing participation of
   the teacher and students in the teaching and learning process. Drawing
   on the analyses of discourse from videotaped lessons and the interviews
   with the teacher and students, five different types of interactions that
   emphasized mathematical sense-making and justification of ideas and
   arguments were identified. Excerpts from transcriptions of such
   interactions are provided to illustrate the learning practices, either
   academic or non-academic, that students developed in response to these
   interactions.},

Abstract = {This paper is methodologically based, addressing the study of
   mathematics teaching by linking micro- and macro-perspectives.
   Considering teaching as activity, it uses Activity Theory and, in
   particular, the Expanded Mediational Triangle (EMT) to consider the role
   of the broader social frame in which classroom teaching is situated.
   Theoretical and methodological approaches are illustrated through
   episodes from a study of the mathematics teaching and learning in a
   Year-10 class in a UK secondary school where students were considered as
   ``lower achievers{''} in their year group. We show how a number of
   questions about mathematics teaching and learning emerging from
   microanalysis were investigated by the use of the EMT. This framework
   provided a way to address complexity in the activity of teaching and its
   development based on recognition of central social factors in
   mathematics teaching-learning.},

Title = {Collaboration between Mathematicians and Mathematics Educators:
   dialogical inquiry as a methodological tool in Mathematics Education
   research},

Abstract = {Collaboration between Mathematicians and Mathematics Educators is
   crucial in advancing knowledge on the teaching and learning of
   Mathematics, particularly in advanced Mathematics pedagogy. However,
   there is a need for the type of collaborations where Mathematicians and
   Mathematics Educators can find common ground, and the synergy of their
   expertise results in new, hybrid meanings and understandings that can
   benefit practice. This paper aims to help researchers from these
   communities come together by presenting a novel methodology for
   collaborative inquiry and qualitative data analysis-dialogical
   inquiry-based on Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of dialogism. In this
   framework, ``truth{''} is conceived as never finalised but always
   coevolving through dialogue that involves participants with different
   ``voices{''} and ``languages{''}. We describe the three principles that
   underpin dialogical inquiry: motivation, power balance and a process for
   solving disagreements. These three principles interact together to
   create a space where critically productive dialogue allows for meanings
   to coevolve and new, hybrid understandings to emerge. We illustrate our
   operationalisation of these principles (i.e., the methods of dialogical
   inquiry) in two areas: understanding solutions to linear ordinary
   differential equations and making meaning of the Bakhtinian concept of
   superaddressee. We reflect on our use of this methodology in Mathematics
   Education research and invite the readers to create their own dialogic
   spaces of collaboration.},

Abstract = {In this concluding commentary, I embed the articles of the special issue
   ``Transition from school into university mathematics: experiences across
   educational contexts{''} into the current landscape of research on
   secondary-tertiary transition, and discuss the advancement they made
   related to the synthesis published in 2008 by Gueudet. My aim is to
   elaborate a new synthesis across the topics of affect and the use of
   sociocultural perspectives that have framed the work of all
   contributions. For that, I focus on four major themes. First, I consider
   the complex relationship between affect and socio-cultural dimensions in
   the papers, which raises the need for theory networking in further
   research clarifying mutual roles of the two dimensions. Second,
   international diversity is only partially expressed in the collection of
   papers, thus should be a major topic of research in future that would
   provide a more comprehensive view on the transition from school to
   university mathematics. I thirdly discuss how the collection of papers
   deepens our understanding of the complexity and diversity related to the
   students' experience with the secondary-tertiary transition and its
   potential impact for teaching. Finally, I propose and justify the need
   for systematic design and evaluation of interventions targeting a change
   in students' affect related to the transition. In sum, the wide range of
   the significant findings in this special issue and their mutual
   relations add new perspectives to the research on secondary-tertiary
   transition and evidence a new spectrum of research directions.},

Abstract = {Mathematics-specific learning difficulties and disabilities (MLD) have
   received increasing attention in scholarly research. In this study, we
   place MLD research in its wider context of risk societies by discussing
   the manufacturing of MLD as a risk. This framing of MLD builds on a
   certain idea of hope in how research could provide the means to better
   understand and support learners with MLD. We conduct a Foucault-informed
   analysis to understand how scholarly knowledge about MLD has been
   produced through discourses of risk and hope. Our material consists of
   30 influential journal articles published in the three fields of MLD
   research: cognitive sciences, special education and mathematics
   education. Our study indicates that MLD has been predominantly
   conceptualised through a technico-scientific risk discourse that frames
   MLD as harmful for learners and societies alike; such risk discourse
   relies on a discourse of hope in scientific methods. We also analyse a
   social risk discourse that identifies risks in social exclusion and
   marginalisation of students with MLD, finding hope in inclusive learning
   environments. Based on our analysis, we propose that the mere
   conceptualisation of MLD has thoroughly revolved around discourses of
   current liminalities (risk) and enunciations of better futures (hope).
   However, what has been unexplored is the politics of such risk and hope
   discourses themselves. We propose a socio-politically oriented discourse
   of risk/hope as a way to reframe scientific knowledge production about
   MLD. This discourse identifies risks not in MLD itself but in how
   research manufactures MLD as a threat to both economic growth and
   student identities. Instead of asking research communities to mitigate
   the risk of MLD, we call for them to embrace it.},

Abstract = {Professional development (PD) courses are the main context for
   mathematics teachers' lifelong learning. Leaders with expertise are
   needed to facilitate these courses; thus, there is a growing interest in
   understanding the nature of this profession, its core practices, and the
   challenges it entails. This paper focuses on a specific group of
   facilitators: experienced mathematics teachers who have just begun
   facilitating PD courses in addition to their classroom teaching. To
   better understand these novice facilitators' practices, a commognitive
   approach was implemented to examine how they draw on their mathematics
   teaching experience when leading PD courses. In commognitive terms,
   these practitioners draw on multiple professional discourses, but mostly
   on the discourses of teaching and facilitation. The analysis of the
   challenges and affordances associated with participating in these two
   professional discourses showed that novice facilitators bring into play
   their teaching practices in four distinct ways: enacting a familiar
   practice, negating a familiar practice, questioning the relevance of a
   familiar practice, and generating a new practice based on their teaching
   experience. We claim that novice facilitators' well-established identity
   as teachers is both a challenge and an asset in grounding successful
   facilitation practices. Overall, facilitators modify their teaching
   experience through the adoption, adaptation, and retraction of their
   teaching practices. Implications for the preparation and support of
   facilitators, within processes of upscaling PD programs, are discussed.},

Abstract = {One typical challenge in algebra education is that many students justify
   the equivalence of expressions only by referring to transformation rules
   that they perceive as arbitrary without being able to justify these
   rules. A good algebraic understanding involves connecting the
   transformation rules to other characterizations of equivalence of
   expressions (e.g., description equivalence that both expressions
   describe the same situation or figure). In order to overcome this
   disconnection even before variables are introduced, a design research
   study was conducted in Grade 5 to design and investigate an early
   algebra learning environment to establish stronger connections between
   different mental models and representations of equivalence of
   expressions. The qualitative analysis of design experiments with 14
   fifth graders revealed deep insights into complexities of connecting
   representations. It confirmed that many students first relate the
   representations in ways that are too superficial without establishing
   deep connections. Analyzing successful students' processes helped to
   identify an additional characterization that can support students in
   bridging the connection between other characterizations, which we call
   restructuring equivalence. By including learning opportunities for
   restructuring equivalence, students can be supported to compare
   expressions in graphical and symbolic representation simultaneously and
   dynamically. The design research study disentangles the complex
   requirements for realizing the design principle of connecting multiple
   representations, which should be of relevance beyond the specific
   concept of equivalence and applicable to other mathematical topics.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it a new way of being in a changed
   and uncertain world. Aotearoa/New Zealand took a well-being approach and
   in turn, we share the positive outcomes which resulted for some low
   socio-economic schools and communities in relation to teacher learning
   and relationships with families. In this article, we report on how
   teachers and schools connected with diverse students and their families
   during the period of remote learning. We draw on the responses from 20
   teachers and school leaders who participated in interviews. Following
   the wider government focus, schools took a well-being first approach
   which led to increased connections and positive home/school
   relationships. The results highlight how a disruptive event such as
   COVID-19 can also be a time to focus on strengths of diverse communities
   and gain insights. We demonstrate that while focusing on mathematics,
   teachers and school leaders gained insights related to their students'
   funds of knowledge and saw opportunities for learning for students,
   parents, and the teachers themselves.},

Abstract = {We are interested in understanding how university students learn to use
   programming as a tool for ``authentic{''} mathematical investigations
   (i.e., similar to how some mathematicians use programming in their
   research work). The theoretical perspective of the instrumental approach
   offers a way of interpreting this learning in terms of development of
   schemes by students; these development processes are called instrumental
   geneses. Nevertheless, how these schemes evolve has not been fully
   explained. In this paper, we propose to enrich the theoretical frame of
   the instrumental approach by a model of scheme evolution and to use this
   new approach to investigate learning to use programming for pure and
   applied mathematics investigation projects at the university level. We
   examine the case of one student completing four investigation projects
   as part of a course workload. We analyze the productive and constructive
   aspects of the student's activity and the dynamic aspect of the
   instrumental geneses by identifying the mobilization and evolution of
   schemes. We argue that our approach constitutes a new theoretical and
   methodological contribution deepening the understanding of students'
   instrumented learning processes. Identifying instrumented schemes
   illuminates in particular how mathematical knowledge and programming
   knowledge are combined. The analysis in terms of scheme evolutions
   reveals which characteristics of the situations lead to such evolutions
   and can thus inform the design of teaching.},

Abstract = {In India, a curriculum reform inspired by critical perspectives has
   sought to transform primary mathematics teaching and learning. It is
   aimed at strengthening socio-cultural-political connections between
   school mathematics and students' life experiences, thereby challenging
   traditional textbook culture. At the same time, this initiative has
   retained the textbook as a vehicle of reform while seeking to subvert
   many of its established conventions. Guided by Remillard's idea of modes
   of engagement, this paper analyses the innovative Math-Magic textbooks
   associated with the Indian National Curriculum Framework. It
   investigates how these textbooks represent and communicate the framework
   ideas, focusing on key curricular elements and on the teacher as reader.
   Analysing the `voice' and `structure' of the textbooks as well as the
   `contexts' used, it is revealed that they use a radically unique voice
   to introduce school mathematics while also attempting to use authentic
   and socially relevant contexts within their tasks. However, they have
   limited structural support to communicate these ideas clearly to the
   teacher-reader. The paper has implications for studying reformed
   textbooks in primary school mathematics in the Global South, where they
   remain the main teaching resource for teachers. Further, by focusing on
   `context', the notion of modes of engagement within textbooks is
   extended through socio-cultural perspectives.},

Abstract = {Although group work is considered beneficial for problem solving, the
   listening that is needed for jointly solving mathematical problems is
   under-researched. In this article, the usefulness of two communication
   frameworks for understanding students' listening is examined, using data
   from an educational design research study in an upper secondary
   mathematics classroom in Sweden. From the analysis, it was apparent that
   these frameworks did not provide sufficient information about the
   complexity of listening in this context. Consequently, a new framework,
   ``productive listening,{''} is described which focuses on observable
   features connected to students' ability to show willingness to listen
   and to request listening from others. This framework included the
   purpose for listening, connected to problem-solving stages, and social
   aspects to do with respecting the speaker's contribution as being
   valuable and feeling that one's own contribution would be listened to.
   These two aspects are linked to socio-mathematical norms about expecting
   to listen to others' mathematical thinking and to ask clarifying
   questions about this thinking. By using this framework on the data from
   the earlier study, it was possible to better understand the complexity
   of listening in group work about mathematical problem solving.},

Title = {Shape-shifting Davydov's ideas for early number learning in South Africa},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {106},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {397-412},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this paper, we share details of a South African early grades' number
   intervention informed by aspects of Davydov's writing on early number
   teaching and learning. A key part of Davydov's approach to early number
   teaching involves starting with attention to relationships between
   quantities rather than with counting. The Structuring Number Starters
   (SNS) intervention focused-over a nine-year period-on supporting early
   grades' students to move beyond the calculating-by-counting approaches
   that are prevalent in South Africa. In attending to this focus, the
   intervention shifted increasingly towards an emphasis on relationships
   between quantities, though not in the same format or task sequence as
   advocated by Davydov. The contextual and cultural features that led to
   our adaptations-or shape-shifting-are highlighted in this paper. We
   interrogate key aspects of Davydov's approaches to early number teaching
   in relation to key features typical of South African classroom
   mathematics teaching in order to understand the evolution of the SNS
   initiative. Quasi-longitudinal interview-based assessment data available
   from a cross-attainment sample of students in 2011, 2014 and 2018
   indicate shifts over time from calculating-by-counting to
   calculating-by-structuring. These outcomes point to successes with moves
   into increasingly structured ways of working with early number, but
   suggest also that these successes may be contingent on some fluency with
   forward and backward number word sequences. The outcomes suggest that it
   is feasible to explore interventions directing attention to early number
   structure from the outset in larger scale studies.},

Abstract = {By using Shlomo Vinner's credit system concept, we show that summative
   assessment is a rather vague and underrepresented notion in mathematics
   education literature. The emotional drive behind this article is
   expressed in the following questions: How is it possible to look for
   concrete exclusionary school practices that qualify some and disqualify
   others without realizing that promotion/exclusion only becomes effective
   when a certain symbol is officially attached to the name of a student?
   How is it possible not to notice that promotion/exclusion can only be
   based on assessment-evaluation of mathematical content ability? How is
   it possible that mathematics education literature never broaches the
   consequences of assessment-evaluation on the lives of the students? We
   argue that these are not due to a temporary blindness of mathematics
   education research, but, rather, that we are dealing with a symptom. We
   focus on the dichotomous aspect of summative assessment as potentially
   loaded with anguish for students and teachers; we call it the splitting
   moment and endeavor to discuss its consequences for students and
   teachers.},

Abstract = {The pedagogical principle learning by research guides the current
   curriculum in agricultural high schools in Brazil. A problematization of
   the principle shows how (1) it feeds into current neoliberal and
   corporate agendas in the education sector, and (2) it associates
   mathematical formalism and abstraction as necessary conditions for the
   production and use of biotechnology. Data consists of official national
   and institutional policy documents, as well as interviews conducted with
   nine former students, along with their school notebooks and tests. The
   theoretical and methodological framework draws on the work of Michel
   Foucault. It is argued that neoliberal market values are embedded in the
   mathematics education, through the articulation of abstract and formal
   reasoning with techno-scientific knowledge, for the purpose of
   competitive production. The learning by research principle shapes
   students' subjectivities to desire becoming techno-scientificized
   individuals. The ethical question of the subordination of the value of
   mathematics education to a neoliberal, predominantly marketized logic is
   raised as a challenge to the role of mathematics in contemporary
   cultures.},

Title = {Professional development of mathematics teachers toward the facilitation

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Volume = {97},

Abstract = {Collaborative work in small groups is often a suitable context for
   yielding substantial individual learning outcomes. Indeed, small-group
   collaboration has recently become an educational goal rather than a
   means. Yet, this goal is difficult to attain, and students must be
   taught how to learn together. In this paper, we focus on how to prepare
   teachers to become facilitators of small-group collaboration. The
   current case study monitors a group of six prospective teachers and
   their instructor during a one-semester course. The instructor was a
   skilled mathematics teacher with strong beliefs about what is entailed
   in establishing a mini-culture of learning to learn together and about
   how to facilitate student group work in problem-solving situations. We
   describe the learning path followed by the instructor, including the
   digital environment. The findings show that by the end of the course,
   the students became more competent facilitators of learning to learn
   together.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with cognitive aspects of students' struggles
   in situations in which familiar concepts are reconsidered in a new
   mathematical domain. Examples of such cross-curricular concepts are
   divisibility in the domain of integers and in the domain of polynomials,
   multiplication in the domain of numbers and in the domain of vectors,
   and roots in the domain of reals and in the domain of complex numbers.
   The article introduces a polysemous approach for structuring students'
   concept images in these situations. Post-exchanges from an online forum
   and excerpts from an interview were analyzed for illustrating the
   potential of the approach for indicating possible sources of students'
   misconceptions and meta-ways of thinking that might make students aware
   of their mistakes.},

Abstract = {The paper reports on the use of culturally relevant teaching in a class
   located in a patriarchal community. The paper is conceptualised around
   the notion that learners' familiar context provided by the
   socio-cultural activities can facilitate mathematics learning and make
   it fun to learn. Data were derived from a lesson activity using
   semi-structured interviews, observation and video recordings. The
   findings reveal the prevalence of culturally oriented gender-related
   stereotypes such as tendency by boys to marginalise girls during the
   lesson activities and girls, in turn, attribute the treatment to their
   cultural beliefs and practices.},

Abstract = {In order to develop a deeper understanding of mathematics teaching
   expertise, in this study we use the Documentational Approach to
   Didactics to explore the resource systems of three Chinese mathematics
   ``expert{''} teachers. Exploiting the Western and Eastern literature we
   examine the notion of ``mathematics teaching expertise{''}, as it is
   perceived in the East and the West. The data consist of two rounds of
   in-depth interviews, observations and teachers' representations of their
   resource systems, where teachers describe their resources connected to
   their practice, their perceptions of mathematics teaching expertise, and
   how to develop it. Subsequently, the data are analyzed with respect to
   the different facets of the notion of teaching expertise and related to
   the teachers' views and practices, in order to deepen our understandings
   of what proficiency in mathematics teaching might mean and how to
   develop it, seen through the lens of `resources'. The significance of
   the study relates to the enhancement of mathematics teachers' expertise
   and capacity building when working in collectives (e.g., in teacher
   professional development), in order to develop a strong workforce for
   supporting and helping to improve pupil learning.},

Volume = {94},

Abstract = {The studies regarding how the comprehension of geometric shapes evolves
   in childhood are largely based on the assessment of children's responses
   during the course of tasks linked to the recognition, classification or
   explanation of prototypes and models. Little attention has been granted
   to the issue as to what extent the geometric shape turns out to be an
   expressive tool that young children spontaneously use in their pictorial
   productions and also, whether or not methodological research approaches
   aimed at the examination of unprompted usage of geometric shapes in
   childhood may be useful regarding the study of the development of
   geometric thinking. This evidence provided by this study is coherent
   with the assumption that before starting primary education, internal
   representation of closed curves, quadrilaterals and triangles should
   have been developed by a significant number of children and, more
   interestingly, that young children's graphical expressivity appears
   liaised to their skill to depict two-dimensional geometric shapes.},

Title = {Pre-service teachers' conceptions of effective teacher talk: their
   critical reflections on a sample teacher-student dialogue},

Abstract = {This study aimed to explore pre-service elementary teachers' (PSTs')
   conceptions of effective teacher talk in mathematics instruction, which
   were interpreted primarily based on the concept of communicative
   approach. This was accomplished through a task that involves analyzing
   and evaluating a sample teacher-student dialogue. This study
   specifically investigated: (a) aspects of the sample dialogue that PSTs
   attended to in critiquing the teacher talk, (b) PSTs' espoused
   conceptions of effective teacher talk in an authoritative-dialogic
   approach framework, and (c) comparison between PSTs' interpretations and
   the researchers' interpretation. Forty-six elementary PSTs engaged in
   the task and their responses were analyzed using the inductive content
   analysis approach. Findings showed that PSTs attended to various
   features of effective teacher-student dialogue; however, they paid more
   attention to the form of teacher talk than the function of it in
   context. PSTs' justifications used in evaluating the sample
   teacher-student dialogue showed some glaring differences from
   researchers' evaluations in regards to how the presented teacher talk
   would function in terms of the dialogic-authoritative spectrum. PSTs
   underscored affective support and clarity of teacher talk at its surface
   level, while showing strong resistance to the intentional vagueness
   within teacher talk, which might accommodate more dialogic engagement.
   This study suggests that initial teacher training programs should
   include more specific investment in PSTs' insights into effective use of
   classroom dialogue for learning.},

Abstract = {The referential theory of meaning as well as the use-oriented theory of
   meaning have huge impacts on the discussion of meaning in mathematics
   education. Here, I present a third theory in terms of an intentionality
   interpretation of meaning, which provides an alternative departure for
   the discussion of meaning in mathematics education. The importance of
   intentionality for understanding human phenomena was emphasised by both
   Brentano and Husserl. They associated intentionality with a pure stream
   of consciousness, which constitutes an a priori to any human experience.
   I agree that the notion of intentionality is important; however, I find
   it crucial to provide a paradigmatic uprooting of this notion and to
   consider it as being structured by economic, political, cultural, and
   discursive factors. Such real-life intentionalities constitute the basis
   for an intentionality interpretation of meaning. I explore this
   interpretation with respect to mathematics education by addressing
   imaginations, possibilities, obstructions, hopes, fears, stereotypes and
   preconceptions. I relate meaning in mathematics education to far away
   horizons of students' life worlds, to negotiations, to political issues,
   to diversity and to instrumentalism.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how three widely used calculus textbooks in the
   U.S. realize the derivative as a point-specific object and as a function
   using Sfard's communicational approach. For this purpose, the study
   analyzed word-use and visual mediators for the limit process through
   which the derivative at a point was objectified, and word-use and visual
   mediators for the derivative process through which the derivative as a
   function was objectified. The analysis highlighted inconsistency in
   realizations of the limit process and object, and derivative process and
   object found in some instances, and implicit discussion on relations
   among different visual mediators. Specifically, the results of this
   study led to four observations about issues suggested by one or more of
   the textbooks: a) visual mediators of the initial and final objects, and
   the visual mediators of these processes were often inconsistent; b)
   transformations of visual mediators from initial object, through
   process, to final object were often implicit both in one visual mediator
   and across multiple visual mediators; c) visual mediators for the limit
   processes were sometimes disconnected from the initial and final
   objects, or the connections were not explicit; and d) realizations of
   both the derivative at a point and the derivative of a function were
   mediated with nearly identical symbols suggesting a possible difficulty
   with understanding the difference between them.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to research on the material dimensions of
   teaching and learning mathematics, arguing that perception is not
   sensory integration or synthesis of multi-modal information, but rather
   a speculative investment in specific material encounters. This approach
   entails sociopolitical consequences for how we work with dis/ability in
   mathematics classrooms because it foregrounds how the relationship
   between sense (as meaning) and sense (as sensation) can be fundamentally
   altered. I focus on how visual perception in mathematics can be
   reconceived in these terms, drawing principally on the philosophical
   insights of Michel Serres and Brian Massumi. This paper shows how
   philosophical work on perception can shed light on embodied mathematics,
   opening up discussion about the potentiality of the human body.},

Abstract = {The work that mathematics teachers do is frequently mathematical in
   nature and different from other professions. Understanding and
   describing common ways that teachers draw upon their content knowledge
   in the practice of teaching is important. Building on the descriptions
   by McCrory et al. (Journal for Research in Mathematics Education 43(5)
   584-615, 2012) of two primary ways teachers use their content
   knowledge-decompressing and trimming-this paper differentiates between
   micro- and macro-levels of mathematical complexity as a way to extend
   and further conceptualize the moves that teachers make at a more nuanced
   grain size. This paper explains and portrays their counterparts,
   micro-level trimming and macro-level decompressing, which we discuss as
   concealing and foreshadowing complexity, respectively. Support for their
   use in teachers' work is provided through specific examples.
   Implications for the mathematical preparation and professional
   development of teachers are discussed.},

Title = {Comparison of types of generalizations and problem-solving schemas used

Abstract = {A cognitive schema is a mechanism which allows an individual to organize
   her/his experiences in such a way that a new similar experience can
   easily be recognised and dealt with successfully. Well-structured
   schemas provide for the knowledge base for subsequent mathematical
   activities. A new experience can be assimilated into a previously
   existing schema or, if that is not possible, an existing schema must be
   accommodated to a new experience. These processes are applied in all the
   different areas of mathematics, including mathematical problem solving.
   The paper presents a study conducted with primary teacher students, the
   aim of which was to gain a deeper insight into the way of reasoning of
   individuals when presented with a mathematical problem. The types of
   generalization used by individuals and their problem solving schemas
   were analysed. The research results lead to some interesting
   conclusions. The type of generalization used for solving a problem is
   related to the type of the problem: if the relationship between the
   problem and the mathematical concept can be established, the reasoning
   type of generalization prevails. The results also confirm the importance
   of a well-structured schema for the successful solving of a complex
   mathematical problem. The students applying unstructured or partially
   formed schemas had problems when addressing a complex problem, whereas
   the students who were able to solve it mostly accommodated or
   assimilated their knowledge, which again proves these processes to be a
   necessary prerequisite for successful problem solving.},

Abstract = {This paper extends work about quantitative reasoning related to
   covarying quantities involved in rate of change. It reports a multiple
   case study of three students' reasoning about quantities involved in
   rate of change when working on tasks incorporating multiple
   representations of covarying quantities. When interpreting relationships
   between associated amounts, students identified sections (e.g., an
   interval on a graph) in which they could make comparisons between
   amounts of change in quantities. Although such reasoning is useful for
   interpreting a Cartesian graph as a representation of covarying
   quantities, it does not foster attention to variation in the intensity
   of change in covarying quantities (e.g., a decreasing increase).
   Focusing on the kinds of relationships students make between amounts of
   change in covarying quantities might provide further insight into how
   students could develop a robust understanding of rate of change.},

Abstract = {The data reported in this article come from a large project whose goal
   was to explore how Latin American students in Catalonia, Spain use their
   two languages-Spanish and Catalan-to support their learning of
   mathematics in small groups with other students who are Spanish- or
   Catalan-dominant. For 5 years, lessons from bilingual mathematics
   classrooms in three public secondary schools were video-recorded and
   transcribed. In the presentation of findings, I discuss three language
   practices that emerged from the analyses of several classroom instances
   as follows: (1) caution with mathematical vocabulary, (2) invention of
   terms, and (3) word-for-word translation. One example is chosen to
   represent each practice and some of its situated effects. The first two
   examples support the view that the experience of language difficulties,
   either real or presumed, contributes to generating opportunities that
   may be beneficial to mathematics learning. The third example, where the
   focus on the mathematics is hindered, points to a contrasting finding.
   Unlike other studies in the field, which have reported the difficulties
   and obstacles that arise in learning and teaching due to bilingualism in
   the classroom, I propose a change of focus through the conceptualization
   of language as a potential for thinking and doing, and particularly for
   learning and teaching mathematics.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we react to Lagrange and Kynigos's contribution to this
   special issue, in which they present some of their experiences from two
   cross-case studies in the ReMath project (associated respectively with
   the use of two dynamic digital artefacts, Casyop,e and Cruislet). They
   described how the project, which involved teams from three different
   countries (France, Italy and Greece), working in different conditions
   and relying on different theoretical approaches, was structured in order
   to address the role played by contextual characteristics. We consider
   how the ReMath approach of using cross-studies, and especially the
   inclusion of a cross-analysis phase, served to identify particularities
   associated with designing and implementing mathematics learning
   scenarios using digital tools. In their discussion of the process of
   re-contextualising, one of the factors which appears to have been
   particularly influential in shaping research activities was theoretical
   framework and they show how this factor both influences and is
   influenced by institutional and cultural characteristics. To further
   explore some of the other important contextual factors they pinpoint,
   such as the role and engagement of teachers, student characteristics and
   issues related to the empirical settings, we reflect upon the processes
   of re-contextualisation that we could identify in our own research.},

Abstract = {This article provides a critical commentary on the concepts of
   representation and digital artefacts in Morgan and Kynigos's article of
   this Special Issue. To set the context, in the first part, I examine
   some of the tensions that arose during discussions through the 1980s and
   1990s about representation in mathematics education research. Then, I
   comment on the conceptual differences between Morgan's and Kynigos's
   approaches. These differences point to different epistemological
   assumptions that lead to different conceptualizations of artefacts in
   learning processes. In the last part, I argue that Morgan's and
   Kynigos's approaches have the merit of moving the discussion about
   representations to new theoretical horizons. I suggest, however, that a
   discussion about representations and digital artefacts requires a
   thematized account of the manner in which the phenomenological artefact-
   and representation-mediated knowledge produced by students in the
   classroom relates to the target cultural mathematical knowledge. Such an
   account, I contend, requires an explicit ontological conception of
   knowing and knowledge. I conclude the article with an example in which
   knowledge is considered as codified movement and knowing as the event of
   its enactment in concrete practice. Within this Hegelian materialist
   viewpoint, representations are neither predicated in terms of an
   adequacy between ideas and their representations nor as heuristic
   devices in meaning making processes. Representations are rather an
   integral part of the activity of knowledge presentation.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to introduce a measure of standards-based
   mathematics teaching practices, the Mathematics Scan (M-Scan), and to
   examine its validity and score reliability. First, we define
   standards-based mathematics teaching practices based on eight dimensions
   that have emerged in recent conceptualizations by researchers and in the
   context of existing observational measures. Second, we present three
   sources of validity evidence: content review by experts, analysis of
   response processes of coders, and convergent and discriminant patterns
   with existing observational measures. Third, we provide evidence of
   inter-coder (or inter-rater) reliability through analyses of variance
   components and calculation of reliability coefficients, using the
   framework of generalizability theory. Results show the M-Scan holds
   promise as a useful tool in mathematics education research, measuring
   indicators of standards-based teaching practices unique to the subject
   of mathematics.},
