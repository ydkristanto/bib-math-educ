Abstract = {William of Ockham responds from the dead to an article appearing in the
   January 1992 issue of the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education,
   in which Paul Cobb, Erna Yackel, and Terry Wood propose a
   `'constructivist alternative to the representational view of mind.''
   Ockham, now a convert to Platonism, argues three points. First, that by
   opposing construction to representation, Cobb et al. misinterpret the
   postepistemological perspective of Richard Rorty's 1979 influential
   book, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. Second, that by opposing
   mathematics in the students' mind to mathematics in the environment,
   and, in particular, by attempting to argue that the representational
   theory of mind opens the `'learning paradox,'' Cobb et al. misinterpret
   Carl Bereiter (1985), confuse ontological and epistemological issues,
   stumble into the perennial philosophical problem of universals, and
   indicate that they might be interested in discussing the philosophy of
   mathematics. Third, that in arguing for a relatively pure, `'radical''
   constructivism, Cobb et al. mistake the pragmatic force of the
   constructivist argument, confuse matters of value with matters of taste,
   and attempt to fashion too dogmatic a connection between theory and
   practice in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Korean children's ability to solve addition problems with sums of 10,
   single-digit addition problems with sums between 10 and 18, and
   single-digit subtraction problems with minuends between 10 and 18 was
   assessed in interviews given at the end of the first semester of first
   grade, before children had studied problems involving numbers larger
   than 10 in school.  These children showed considerable competence with
   all three kinds of problems, solving correctly 95\%, 85\%, and 75\% of
   these problems, respectively.  Almost two-thirds of the solutions of the
   problems above 10 were addition or subtraction recomposition methods
   structured around ten or known facts.  Korean children demonstrated two
   finger methods that allowed fingers to be reused to show sums over 10. 
   These methods and the regular named-ten Korean number words for numbers
   between 10 and 18 ({''}ten, ten one, ten two, ten three,..., ten
   eight{''}) support Korean children's learning of three efficient
   recomposition methods structured around ten.},

Abstract = {Emergent graphical shape thinking (EGST) involves interpreting or
   constructing a graph as dynamically generated, which is useful across
   science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. Although
   evidence suggests that students as young as middle school can engage in
   EGST with support, other research indicates most college students and
   U.S. teachers do not spontaneously engage in such reasoning when
   potentially productive. We describe a local instruction theory (LIT) to
   support middle school students developing EGST as part of their graphing
   meanings. We then present a case study to show how two students engaged
   with a task sequence designed with the LIT in mind to develop meanings
   for EGST. This article illustrates general principles researchers and
   educators could use to promote students' graphing meanings.},

Abstract = {This study proposes task of teaching as an organizer of dimensionality
   in teachers' subject matter knowledge for teaching (SMK) and
   investigates it in the context of measuring SMK for teaching high school
   geometry (SMK-G). We hypothesize that teachers use different SMK-G in
   different aspects of their teaching work and that such differences can
   be scaled and associated with key elements of instruction. Analyses of
   602 high school teachers' responses to two sets of items designed to
   measure the SMK-G used in two particular tasks of teaching-understanding
   students' work (USW) and choosing givens for a problem (CGP)-suggested
   the two scales of SMK-G to be distinguishable and differently related to
   experience in teaching high school geometry.},

Abstract = {Our field has generally reached a consensus that active-learning
   approaches improve student success; however, there is a need to explore
   the ways that particular instructional approaches affect various student
   groups. We examined the relationship between gender and student learning
   outcomes in one context: inquiry-oriented abstract algebra. Using
   hierarchical linear modeling, we analyzed content assessment data from
   522 students. We detected a gender performance difference (with men
   outperforming women) in the inquiry-oriented classes that was not
   present in other classes. We take the differential result between men

Title = {The Effects of Mathematics Preparation and Mathematics Attitudes on
   College Calculus Performance},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Students' attitudes toward mathematics and the strength of their
   mathematics preparation typically go hand in hand such that their
   specific effects are difficult to disentangle. Employing the method of
   propensity weighting of a continuous variable, we built hierarchical
   linear models in which mathematics attitudes and preparation are
   uncorrelated. Data used came from a national survey of U.S. college
   students taking introductory calculus (N = 5,676). A
   1-standard-deviation increase in mathematics preparation predicted a
   4.72-point higher college calculus grade, whereas a 1-standard-deviation
   increase in mathematics attitudes resulted in a 3.15-point gain. Thus,
   the effect of mathematics preparation was about 1.5 times that of
   mathematics attitudes. The two variables did not interact, nor was there
   any interaction between gender and these variables.},

Abstract = {This study investigates relationships between teacher characteristics
   and teachers' beliefs about mathematics teaching and learning and the
   extent to which teachers claim awareness of their students' mathematical
   dispositions. A professional background survey, a beliefs and awareness
   survey, and a teacher mathematical knowledge assessment were
   administered to 259 novice upper-elementary and 184 novice middle-grades
   teachers. Regression analyses revealed statistically significant
   relationships between teachers' beliefs and awareness and teachers'
   mathematical knowledge, special education certification, race, gender,
   and the percentage of their students with free and reduced meal status.
   This report offers interpretations of findings and implications for
   mathematics teacher education.},

Abstract = {Quantitative and qualitative analyses of 37 first-graders' solutions to
   addition problems were conducted to re-examine inconsistencies in
   children's progress from counting-all to counting-on. The authors
   applied the constructivist's participatory-anticipatory stage
   distinction as a tool for fine-grained assessment. Among solutions given
   by case-representing children during 20-minute clinical interviews, the
   authors distinguish both stages within each of 2 known schemes that
   constitute counting-on, Anticipating Start From and Anticipating Stop At
   (with double counting). The prompt-dependent, Zone of Proximal
   Development-correlated participatory stage provides a lens for
   explaining children's regress to counting-all and concurrent use of
   various solution strategies. The study advances a novel, theoretical
   coordination among 3 frameworks: constructivist scheme theory with a
   focus on the notion of prompt, Vygotsky's sociocultural approach, and
   Siegler's Overlapping Waves Model, and provides a corresponding,
   threefold stance on mathematical tasks.},

Abstract = {Previous research has shown that when confronted with missing-value word
   problems, primary school students strongly tend to use proportional
   solution approaches, even if these approaches are inappropriate. We
   investigated whether (besides the missing-value formulation of word
   problems) the numbers appearing in word problems are part of the
   superficial cues that lead students to (over)use proportionality. A test
   containing proportional and nonproportional word problems was given to
   508 4th, 5th, and 6th graders. Numbers in these problems were
   experimentally manipulated so that the internal and external ratios were
   either integer or not. For proportional problems, performances decreased
   as a result of noninteger ratios. For nonproportional problems,
   noninteger ratios led to a decrease in the overuse of proportionality;
   only in the case of additive nonproportional problems was this decrease
   accompanied by an increase in correct answers. This effect decreased
   from 4th grade to 6th grade. Implications of this study for research and
   practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Many children read mathematics word problems and directly translate them
   to arithmetic operations. More sophisticated problem solvers transform
   word problems into object-based or mental models. Subsequent solutions
   are often qualitatively different because these models differentially
   support cognitive processing. Based on a conception of problem solving
   that integrates mathematical problem-solving and reading comprehension
   theories and using constant comparative methodology (Strauss \& Corbin,
   1994), 98 sixth- and seventh-grade students' problem-solving behaviors
   were described and classified into five categories. Nearly 90\% of
   problem solvers used one behavior on a majority of problems. Use of
   context such as units and relationships, recording information given in
   the problem, and provision of explanations and justifications were
   associated with higher reading and mathematics achievement tests,
   greater success rates, fewer errors, and the ability to preserve the
   structure of problems during recall. These results were supported by
   item-level analyses.},

Abstract = {To test the vision of Standards-based mathematics education, we
   conducted a comparative study of the effects of the Core-Plus
   Mathematics Project (CPMP) curriculum and more conventional curricula on
   growth of student understanding, skill, and problem-solving ability in
   algebra. Results indicate that the CPMP curriculum is more effective
   than conventional curricula in developing student ability to solve
   algebraic problems when those problems are presented in realistic
   contexts and when students are allowed to use graphing calculators.
   Conventional curricula are more effective than the CPMP curriculum in
   developing student skills in manipulation of symbolic expressions in
   algebra when those expressions are presented free of application context
   and when students are not allowed to use graphing calculators.},

Abstract = {To illuminate the cross-national similarities and differences in
   expectations related to students' mathematics experiences between the
   United States and China, I compared all relevant problems that followed
   the content presentation of addition and subtraction of integers in
   several American and Chinese mathematics textbooks. A 3-dimensional
   framework (for mathematical features, contextual features, and
   performance requirements) was developed in this study to analyze these
   textbook problems. The results show that the percentage differences in
   problems' dimensions, mathematical and contextual features, were smaller
   than the difference in problems' performance requirements. Specifically,
   the differences found in problems' performance requirements indicate
   that the American textbooks included more variety in problem
   requirements than the Chinese textbooks. The results are relevant to
   documented cross-national differences in American and Chinese students'
   mathematical performances.},

Abstract = {Lerman, in his challenge to radical constructivism, presented Vygotsky
   as an irreconcilable opponent to Piaget's genetic epistemology and thus
   to von Glasersfeld's radical constructivism. We argue that Lerman's
   stance does not reflect mon Glasersfeld's opinion of Vygotsky's work,
   nor does it reflect Vygotsky's opinion of Piaget's work. We question
   Lerman's interpretation of radical constructivism and explain how the
   ideas of interaction, intersubjectivity, and social goals make sense in
   it. We then establish compatibility between the analytic units in
   Vygotsky's and mon Glasersfeld's models and contrast them with Lerman's
   analytic unit. Consequently, we question Lerman's interpretation of
   Vygotsky. Finally, we question Lerman's use of Vygotsky's work in
   mathematics education, and we contrast that use with how we use mon
   Glasersfeld's radical constructivism.},

Abstract = {In this research, we examined changes in preservice elementary school
   teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics and their
   abilities to provide mathematics instruction that was based on
   children's thinking. The 34 participants in this study were introduced
   to Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) as part of a mathematics methods
   course. Belief-scale scores indicated that significant changes in their
   beliefs and perceptions about mathematics instruction occurred across
   the 2-year sequence of professional course work and student teaching
   during their undergraduate program but that their use of knowledge of
   children's mathematical thinking during instructional planning and
   teaching was limited. Preservice teachers may acknowledge the tenets of
   CGI and yet be unable to use them in their teaching. The results raise
   several questions about factors that may influence success in planning
   instruction on the basis of children's thinking.},

Abstract = {In light of anticipated changes in mathematics education, an alternative
   for the well-known `'research-development-diffusion'' model is
   presented.  It is based on an integration of curriculum research and
   design embedded in `'educational development.''  In this context
   curriculum development is described as purposeful and sensible
   tinkering.  It is argued that the theory production implied in this
   process may be exploited in `'developmental research.''  However,
   developmental research is not yet well established as a research
   discipline.  The core of this article is an effort to explicate the
   characteristics of developmental research and to discuss its
   methodological aspects.},

Abstract = {This study focused on understanding the evaluation of the area of a
   rectangular region as a multiplicative relationship between the lengths
   of the sides.  The analysis of data from a whole-class teaching
   experiment involving prospective elementary teachers resulted in the
   development of a description of the quantitative reasoning involved. 
   Important aspects of this reasoning include the anticipation of a
   rectangular array of units as the structure of the area quantity and the
   subsequent constituting of the units based on the linear measures.  The
   analysis of the prospective teachers' understandings proved useful in
   generating additional problems.  The teachers' engagement with these
   problems resulted in their developing more complete understandings of
   the constitution of area units.},

   education course that emphasized mathematical and pedagogical
   connections and applications of the function concept. Her conceptions
   were revealed during a 10-week period through interviews, observations,
   and written work. The teacher's initial understanding of functions as
   computational activities (e.g., function machines, point plotting,
   vertical line test) was consistent with her larger view of mathematics
   as a collection of `'concrete'' procedures. Although her understanding
   of function grew substantially during the study, her anticipated
   approach to teaching, which was dominated by her narrow view of
   mathematics, was less significantly affected by course activities.},

Abstract = {Data are presented to show that errors in formulating algebraic
   equations are not primarily due to syntactic translation, as has been
   assumed in the literature. Furthermore, it is shown that the reversal
   error is common even when none of the previously published causes of the
   error is applicable. A new explanation is required and is proposed in
   this paper. An examination of students' errors leads us to suggest that
   students generally construct from the natural language statement a
   cognitive model of compared unequal quantities. They formulate equations
   by trying to represent the model directly or by drawing information from
   it. This hypothesis is supported by research on the comprehension of
   relationships by linguists, pyscholinguists and psychologists. Data were
   collected from 281 students in grade 9 in free response format and from
   1048 students in grades 8, 9, and 10 who completed a multiple-choice

Abstract = {Prospective teachers' knowledge of division was investigated through an
   open-response written instrument and through individual interviews.
   Problems were designed to focus on two aspects of understanding
   division: connectedness within and between procedural and conceptual
   knowledge and knowledge of units. Results indicated that the prospective
   teachers' conceptual knowledge was weak in a number of areas including
   the conceptual underpinnings of familiar algorithms, the relationship
   between partitive and quotitive division, the relationship between
   symbolic division and real-world problems, and identification of the
   units of quantities encountered in division computations. The research
   also characterized aspects of individual conceptual differences. The
   research results suggest conceptual areas of emphasis for the
   mathematical preparation of elementary teachers.},

Abstract = {Mathematics education researchers concerned with justice and
   rehumanizing mathematics education are increasingly calling for research
   that takes seriously the values, commitments, and voices of the
   communities for which the research is most consequential. Exclusion of
   or superficial engagement with these perspectives and experiences in
   research and design processes have perpetuated deficit perspectives of
   minoritized communities, rendering them simply the object of reform
   efforts. Consequently, this Research Commentary conceptualizes a
   participatory turn in mathematics education research, offering a set of
   commitments that guide and examine the possibilities and tensions of
   such a turn.},

Abstract = {Empirical evidence exists that enhancing students??? language can
   promote the mathematics learning of multilingual students at risk,
   whereas other target groups (e.g., monolingual students, successful
   students, both with diverse academic language proficiency) have hardly
   been considered. This cluster-randomized controlled trial (N = 589)
   investigates differential effects for these extended target groups,
   comparing two language-responsive interventions (with or without
   vocabulary work) and a control group. The regression analysis reveals
   that all students significantly deepened their conceptual understanding
   in both interventions. Unlike what was anticipated, multilingual
   students??? growth of conceptual understanding had no significant
   additional benefit from integrated vocabulary work. These findings call
   for promoting language-responsive mathematics instruction for all
   students and for using a discursive rather than a vocabulary focus.},

Abstract = {We investigated whether the mathematics studied in 2 content courses of
   an elementary teacher preparation program was retained and used by
   graduates when completing tasks measuring knowledge for teaching
   mathematics. Using a longitudinal design, we followed 2 cohorts of
   prospective teachers for 3 to 4 years after graduation. We assessed
   participants' knowledge by asking them to identify mathematics concepts
   underlying standard procedures, generate multiple solution strategies,
   and evaluate students' mathematical work. We administered parallel tasks
   for 3 mathematics topics studied in the program and one mathematics
   topic not studied in the program. When significant differences were
   found, participants always performed better on mathematics topics
   developed in the program than on the topic not addressed in the program.
   We discuss implications of these findings for mathematics teacher
   preparation.},

Abstract = {This study investigates 3 hypotheses about proof-based mathematics
   instruction: (a) that lectures include informal content (ways of
   thinking and reasoning about advanced mathematics that are not captured
   by formal symbolic statements), (b) that informal content is usually
   presented orally but not written on the board, and (c) that students do
   not record the informal content that is only stated orally but do if it
   is written on the board. We recorded 11 80-minute mathematics lectures
   and photographed the notes of 96 students. We found that (a) informal
   content was common (with, on average, 32 instances per lecture), (b)
   most informal content was presented orally, and (c) typically students
   recorded written content while not recording oral content in their
   notes.},

Abstract = {The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) do not make any
   promises about the teaching practices that should be used to support
   students' enactment of the standards. Thus, equity gets framed as
   achievable through making the standards a goal for all students. We know
   from research on past reform efforts that standards without explicit (or
   companion) teaching practices, and teaching practices without explicit
   attention to equity, will inevitably result in the failure of the
   standards to achieve goals for students. This commentary provides, a
   framework for future research that hypothesizes research-based equitable
   mathematics teaching practices in support of the CCSSM's Standards for
   Mathematical Practice, connecting research, policy, and practice in
   order to realize the equity potential of the CCSSM.},

Abstract = {To understand relationships between students' fractional knowledge and
   algebraic reasoning in the domain of equation writing, an interview
   study was conducted with 12 secondary school students, 6 students
   operating with each of 2 different multiplicative concepts. These
   concepts are based on how students coordinate composite units. Students
   participated in two 45-minute interviews and completed a written
   fractions assessment. Students operating with the second multiplicative
   concept had not constructed fractional numbers, but students operating
   with the third multiplicative concept had; students operating with the
   second multiplicative concept represented multiplicatively related
   unknowns in qualitatively different ways than students operating with
   the third multiplicative concept. A facilitative link is proposed
   between the construction of fractional numbers and how students
   represent multiplicatively related unknowns.},

Abstract = {This article reports results from a study investigating the impact of a
   sustained, comprehensive early algebra intervention in third grade.
   Participants included 106 students; 39 received the early algebra
   intervention, and 67 received their district's regularly planned
   mathematics instruction. We share and discuss students' responses to a
   written pre- and post-assessment that addressed their understanding of
   several big ideas in the area of early algebra, including mathematical
   equivalence and equations, generalizing arithmetic, and functional
   thinking. We found that the intervention group significantly
   outperformed the nonintervention group and was more apt by posttest to
   use algebraic strategies to solve problems. Given the multitude of
   studies among adolescents documenting students' difficulties with
   algebra and the serious consequences of these difficulties, an important
   contribution of this research is the finding that provided the
   appropriate instruction children are capable of engaging successfully
   with a broad and diverse set of big algebraic ideas.},

Abstract = {Mathematical learning disability (MLD) research often conflates low
   achievement with disabilities and focuses exclusively on deficits of
   students with MLDs. In this study I adopt an alternative approach using
   a response-to-intervention MLD classification model and identify the
   resources students draw upon rather than the skills they lack. The
   intervention model involved videotaped one-on-one fraction tutoring
   sessions implemented with students with low mathematics achievement.
   This article presents case studies of two students who did not benefit
   from the tutoring sessions. Detailed diagnostic analyses of the sessions
   revealed that the students understood mathematical representations in
   atypical ways and that this directly contributed to the persistent
   difficulties they experienced. Implications for screening and
   remediation approaches are discussed.},

Abstract = {We present 3 studies trialing arithmetic tasks that support both
   substitutive and basic relational meanings for the equals sign. The
   duality of meanings enabled children to engage meaningfully and
   purposefully with the structural properties of arithmetic statements in
   novel ways. In particular, they observed and exploited distinctive
   transformational effects when using different statement types to make
   substitutions of notation. We show how the initial version of the task
   emphasized the substitutive meaning but not the basic relational
   meaning, and an adapted version required both meanings of the equals
   sign to be flexibly coordinated. We found that some, but not all,
   children were successful at the adapted task and were able to connect
   making substitutions of notation with their existing mental calculation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Generalization is a critical component of mathematical activity and has
   garnered increased attention in school mathematics at all levels. This
   study documents the multiple interrelated processes that support
   productive generalizing in classroom settings. By studying the situated
   actions of 6 middle school students and their teacher researcher working
   on a 3-week unit on quadratic growth functions that can be represented
   by y = ax(2), the study identified 7 major categories of
   generalizing-promoting actions. These actions represent how teachers and
   students can act in interaction with other agents to foster students'
   generalizing activities. Two classroom episodes are presented that
   identify cyclical interaction processes that promoted the development
   and refinement of generalizations. The results highlight generalization
   as a dynamic, socially situated process that can evolve through
   collaborative acts.},

Abstract = {The article discusses an empirical study on the use of history (as a
   goal) in mathematics education. A historical module was designed and
   implemented in a Danish upper secondary class to study how students'
   discussions of metaperspective issues of the historical development of
   mathematics may be anchored in the taught and learned subject matter of
   the module. Based on videos of the implementation (in particular of one
   focus group of students), students' hand-in essay assignments,
   mathematical exercises, questionnaires, and follow-up interviews, the
   question addressed is how such anchoring may be accomplished and/or
   ensured and in what ways it may occur. Using described theoretical
   constructs, 4 different levels regarding anchoring of the students'
   metaperspective discussions are identified (nonanchored, anchored
   comments, arguments, and discussions).},

Abstract = {The development of patterning strategies during the year prior to formal
   schooling was studied in 53 children from 2 similar preschools. One
   preschool implemented a 6-month intervention focusing on repeating and
   spatial patterns. An interview-based Early Mathematical Patterning
   Assessment (EMPA) was developed and administered pre- and
   postintervention, and again following the 1st year of formal schooling.
   The intervention group outperformed the comparison group across a wide
   range of patterning tasks at the post- and follow-up assessments.
   Children from the intervention group demonstrated greater understanding
   of unit of repeat and spatial structuring, and most were also able to
   extend and explain growing patterns 1 year later. In contrast, most of
   the comparison group treated repeating patterns as alternating items and
   rarely recognized simple geometrical patterns. The findings indicate a
   fundamental link between patterning and multiplicative reasoning through
   the development of composite units.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study is to uncover the successes and challenges that
   preservice teachers are likely to experience as they unpack lesson-level
   mathematical learning goals (i.e., identify the subconcepts and
   subskills that feed into target learning goals). Unpacking learning
   goals is a form of specialized mathematical knowledge for teaching, an
   essential starting point for studying and improving one's teaching.
   Thirty K-8 preservice teachers completed 4 written tasks. Each task
   specified a learning goal and then asked the preservice teachers to
   complete a teaching activity with this goal in mind. For example,
   preservice teachers were asked to evaluate whether a Student's responses
   to a series of mathematics problems showed understanding of decimal
   number addition. The results indicate that preservice teachers can
   identify mathematical subconcepts of learning goals in supportive
   contexts but do not spontaneously apply a strategy of unpacking learning
   goals to plan for, or evaluate, teaching and learning. Implications for
   preservice education are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this article, I respond to the recent work of Kaminski, Sloutsky, and
   Heckler (2008a). I advance two major concerns about their research and
   its applicability to learning mathematics: a confounding variable that
   arises from the mathematical differences between the generic examples
   and concrete examples poses a threat to the construct validity of the
   experiments, and the overgeneralization of the success of the treatment,
   given that the measure of success is a prompted near-transfer task.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the ways in which the technological tool, The
   Geometer's Sketchpad, mediated the understandings that high school
   Honors Geometry students developed about geometric transformations by
   focusing on their uses of technological affordances and the ways in
   which they interpreted technological results in terms of figure and
   drawing. The researcher identified different purposes for which students
   used dragging and different purposes for which students used measures.
   These purposes appeared to be influenced by students' mathematical
   understandings that were reflected in how they reasoned about the
   physical representations, the types of abstractions they made, and the
   reactive or proactive strategies employed.},

Abstract = {Government agencies and members of the educational research community
   have petitioned for research-based curricula. The ambiguity of the
   phrase ``research-based,{''} however, undermines attempts to create a

   construct of research-based curricula. One implication is that
   traditional strategies such as market research and research-to-practice
   models are insufficient; more adequate is the use of multiple phases of
   the proffered Curriculum Research Framework.},

Abstract = {Two questions are asked that concern the work of teaching high school
   geometry with problems and engaging students in building a reasoned
   conjecture: What kinds of negotiation are needed in order to engage
   students in such activity? How do those negotiations impact the
   mathematical activity in which students participate? A teacher's work is
   analyzed in two classes with an area problem designed to bring about and
   prove a conjecture about the relationship between the medians and area
   of a triangle. The article stresses that to understand the conditions of
   possibility to teach geometry with problems, questions of
   epistemological and instructional nature need to be asked-not only
   whether and how certain ideas can be conceived by students as they work
   on a problem but also whether and how the kind of activity that will
   allow such conception can be summoned by customary ways of transacting
   work for knowledge.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue for a renewed focus in mathematics education
   research on procedural knowledge. I make three main points: (1) The
   development of students' procedural knowledge has not received a great
   deal of attention in recent research; (2) one possible explanation for
   this deficiency is that current characterizations of conceptual and
   procedural knowledge reflect limiting assumptions about how procedures
   are known; and (3) reconceptualizing procedural knowledge to remedy
   these assumptions would have important implications for both research
   and practice.},

Abstract = {Conflicting findings about the effects of state testing on mathematics
   teaching have a number of roots, including the strong ideological
   positions of advocates and opponents of state tests and the fact that
   state policies vary such that one is likely to find different results in
   different states. The pressure that students, teachers, and
   administrators may feel toward high test scores and the opportunities
   that teachers and administrators may have regarding related professional
   development can also confound findings on the effects of tests on actual
   classroom teaching. This article describes the teaching practices of
   fourth-grade teachers in New Jersey, a state with a fourth-grade
   mathematics test designed to be aligned with state and national
   standards. The intent of this test is to challenge conventional
   practice. However, there is a lack of strong pressure to produce high
   test scores or effective guidance on the kinds of learning opportunities
   that must complement those tests in order to lead to fundamental change
   in teaching. Through interviews and observations of 63 teachers, we
   found that the teachers reported that they changed their practices in
   ways compatible with state and national standards and the test. For
   example, they reported asking their students to solve more open-ended
   problems and to explain their thinking. However, direct observations
   suggested that teachers have adopted specific strategies without
   changing their basic instructional approach. The results from our
   investigation suggest that in the absence of effective professional
   development, testing leads to minimal changes in teaching practice.},

Abstract = {In this study I examine the structures of 2 teachers' beliefs about what
   makes mathematics intrinsically motivating and provide instances of the
   representations of their beliefs at 2 times: before the introduction of
   middle school mathematics curricula organized around the tenets of
   Realistic Mathematics Education and after 1 year of implementing a pilot
   program. Personal constructs analyses are paired with observations of
   teachers' classrooms and their beliefs and perceptions as reported in
   semistructured interviews. Results indicate that the teachers became
   more attuned to the conceptual complexity and challenge of mathematics
   activities and placed less emphasis on task ease over their year of
   involvement in the pilot program. Results are discussed in relation to
   ``job-embedded learning,{''} a form of staff development that fosters
   teachers' development of meaning with regard to reforms, and how such
   learning enables shifts in teacher beliefs and practice.},

Abstract = {The current debates about the future of mathematics education often lead
   to confusion about the role that research should play in settling
   disputes. On the one hand, researchers are called upon to resolve issues
   that really are about values and priorities, and, on the other hand,
   research is ignored when empirical evidence is essential. When research
   is appropriately solicited, expectations often overestimate, or
   underestimate, what research can provide. In this article, by
   distinguishing between values and research problems and by calibrating
   appropriate expectations for research, I address the role that research
   can and should play in shaping standards. Research contributions to the
   current debates are illustrated with brief summaries of some findings
   that are relevant to the standards set by the NCTM.},

Abstract = {Little consensus exists in the research literature concerning the
   relationship between attitude toward mathematics and achievement in
   mathematics. To assess the magnitude of this relationship, the
   researchers conducted a meta-analysis to integrate and summarize the
   findings from 113 primary studies. The statistical results of these
   studies were transformed into a common effect size measure, correlation
   coefficient. This relationship was found to be dependent on a number of
   variables: grade, ethnic background, sample selection, sample size, and
   date of publication. Gender did not have a significant effect on the
   relationship, nor were there any significant interactions among gender,
   grade, and ethnic background. The researchers discuss the findings in
   comparison to previous narrative reviews and meta-analyses, and draw
   implications for practice and further research.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to design and field-test instruction intended
   to help students construct knowledge about addition and subtraction
   story problems and determine if this knowledge would transfer to
   actually solving problems. The study tests two related hypotheses: (a)
   structure-plus-writing instruction will result in improved word-problem
   solving, and (b) this improvement will be more enduring than that
   resulting from a more traditional heuristic and practice-based approach.
   To test these hypotheses, 401 third-grade and fourth-grade students from
   21 classrooms in six schools participated in a study in which the
   problem solving of children taught by a structure-plus-writing approach
   was compared to that of(a) a control group receiving no explicit
   instruction in arithmetic word-problem solving, and (b) a group
   receiving instruction based largely on practice and explicit heuristics.
   Both hypotheses were supported by the results. The
   structure-plus-writing group outperformed the group receiving practice
   and explicit heuristics instruction. Moreover, the
   structure-plus-writing group not only maintained this superiority but
   actually widened the gap, as shown by retention test results 10 weeks
   after treatment. The effectiveness of instruction based on a structured
   approach to authoring arithmetic word problems was strongly supported.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the interrelatedness of various types of
   mathematics anxiety with attitudes toward mathematics, learning
   preferences, study motives, and strategies.  An 80-item version of the
   Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS) was completed by 173 university
   students enrolled in one of three introductory statistics courses
   offered by the departments of mathematics, psychology, or sociology. 
   Mathematics attitude scales were also administered in conjunction with
   the Study Process Questionnaire (SPQ), which depicts students'
   motivations to use study methods associated with contrasting learning
   approaches.  Factor analysis of the MARS identified six factors labeled
   as General Evaluation Anxiety, Everyday Numerical Anxiety, Passive
   Observation Anxiety, Performance Anxiety, Mathematics Test Anxiety, and
   Problem-Solving Anxiety.  The examination of both substantive and
   peripheral factors supported a multidimensional view of mathematics
   anxiety.  Correlational analysis indicated complex interaction patterns
   between attitudes toward mathematics and the six MARS factors, depending
   on the over-all level of anxiety experienced.  Variation in orientation
   to learning also proved significantly related to specific types of
   anxiety, attitudes, and instructional factors.  The results confirm the
   utility of learning-approach theory and instruments for analyzing
   relationships between cognitive and affective components of mathematics
   anxiety.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of various levels of secondary
   school calculus experience on performance in first-year college
   calculus, with focus on student performance on conceptual and procedural
   exam items. Analysis of covariance, with mathematics SAT score as a
   covariate, was employed to explore differences among four groups of
   students. Students who had a year of secondary school calculus, advanced
   placement or otherwise, differed significantly in performance from
   students who had either no calculus or a brief introduction to calculus
   prior to college. A brief secondary school introduction to calculus, in
   comparison with no secondary school calculus, provided an initial
   advantage in the college course. This slight advantage reappeared on the
   final exam and on the procedural subscale of the final exam. Students
   who had studied a full year of secondary school calculus performed
   significantly better than other groups throughout the first-semester
   course. The advantage was revealed more strongly in procedural than in
   conceptual items. There were no significant differences among the four
   groups of students on outcome measures in the second-semester course.
   Students with more secondary school calculus background were more likely
   to continue into the second semester of college calculus.},

Abstract = {Considerable research has been conducted on the critical role of gesture
   and action in children's mathematical thinking. However, teacher
   professional development (PD) has not tended to include specific
   supports for attending to nonverbal student thinking. In this Brief
   Report, we argue for including supports for multimodal teacher noticing
   in teacher PD. We illustrate how a targeted intervention can relatively
   quickly support teachers in learning to notice multimodal student
   thinking and demonstrate how shifting teachers' attention to gesture can
   enrich how they interpret the details of students' thinking.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {We respond to a call to analyze issues of curriculum standards and to
   present alternative storylines by addressing criticisms of the Common
   Core State Standards in early childhood. We describe a storyline from
   multiple media and evaluate this storyline's criticisms, focusing on the
   criticism that the standards are developmentally inappropriate. We
   review research and conclude that the criticism is invalid and may
   reflect a historical belief in the primacy of development over learning
   rather than the research record. Misinterpreting or ignoring relevant
   research has equity consequences because it may particularly harm those
   children most in need of learning support in learning grade-level
   mathematics. Fortunately, theory and research illuminate learning
   trajectories that help all children meet these standards.},

Abstract = {Images of mathematics and mathematicians are often negative and
   stereotyped. These portrayals may work to construct our impressions of
   mathematics and influence students' identity with and future
   participation in the subject. This study examined young adult fiction as
   a context in which school mathematics is portrayed and constructed. I
   used positioning theory and the notion of story lines to analyze a
   sample of 59 books. Portrayals of school mathematics within this sample
   involved multiple story lines, including school mathematics as being
   obligatory but not useful and mathematics classes as tense, terrible,
   difficult, and different but perhaps as places in which to find love.
   Portrayals of mathematics teachers were extremely stereotyped, and some
   girls were just as likely as boys to be positioned as able mathematics
   learners.},

Abstract = {This article describes the development and validation of two forms of
   the Geometry Assessments for Secondary Teachers (GAST), which were
   designed to assess teachers' knowledge for teaching geometry. Both forms
   were developed by teams of mathematicians, mathematics educators,
   psychometricians, and secondary classroom geometry teachers. Predictive
   validity for the GAST assessment was explored by observing and testing
   157 teachers as well as administering pre- and post-tests to 3,698
   students. The reliability coefficient for both GAST assessment forms was
   acceptable (r = .79). GAST assessment scores explained a statistically
   significant but small amount of the variance of student scores,
   demonstrating an effect that was greater than the number of years of
   teaching experience but smaller than the effect of having an advanced
   degree.},

Abstract = {This article reports on elementary students' understanding of time in
   the context of common classroom manipulatives and notational systems.
   Students in Grades 2 (n = 72) and 4 (n = 72) participated in
   problem-solving interviews involving different clocks. Quantitative
   results revealed that students' performances were significantly
   different as a function of the tool available. Descriptive case studies
   of 3 Grade 4 students are presented in which students demonstrated
   competencies in conventions related to benchmark numeric conversions
   between hours and Minutes and counting by 5s around the clock, yet only
   partial competencies related to the integral relationship between hours
   and minutes. Implications for theory and the treatment of time in
   curriculum and instruction are discussed.},

Abstract = {A 14-year-old child with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia participated in 52
   weeks of robotics task-based interviews. We present 3 of her tasks from
   Weeks 1, 20, and 46 along with an overview of the complete 52 weeks. We
   compare the data from the tasks to Brousseau's (1997) Theory of
   Didactical Situations of Mathematics to answer our research questions:
   Can robotics play support the devolution of a fundamental situation to
   an adidactic situation of mathematics for children who are critically
   ill? When children with critical illness engage in robotics play, what
   are the key features of the robotics phenomenon that support devolution
   to an adidactic situation? We found evidence of the robotics supporting
   the devolution of a fundamental situation to an adidactic situation of
   mathematics in each robotics task and evidence of 4 key features (thick
   authenticity, feedback enabling autonomy, connectivity, and competence)
   of robotics play that support this devolution.},

Abstract = {The mathematics education community values using student thinking to
   develop mathematical concepts, but the nuances of this practice are not
   clearly understood. We conceptualize an important group of instances in
   classroom lessons that occur at the intersection of student thinking,
   significant mathematics, and pedagogical opportunities-what we call
   Mathematically Significant Pedagogical Opportunities to Build on Student
   Thinking. We analyze dialogue to illustrate a process for determining
   whether a classroom instance offers such an opportunity and to
   demonstrate the usefulness of the construct in examining classroom
   discourse. This construct contributes to research and professional
   development related to teachers' mathematically productive use of
   student thinking by providing a lens and generating a common language
   for recognizing and agreeing on a critical core of student mathematical
   thinking that researchers can attend to as they study classroom practice
   and that teachers can aspire to notice and build upon when it occurs in
   their classrooms.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effect of 2 types of mathematics content
   organization on high school students' mathematics learning while taking
   account of curriculum implementation and student prior achievement. The
   study involved 2,161 students in 10 schools in 5 states. Within each
   school, approximately 1/2 of the students studied from an integrated
   curriculum (Course 1) and 1/2 studied from a subject-specific curriculum
   (Algebra 1). Hierarchical linear modeling with 3 levels showed that
   students who studied from the integrated curriculum were significantly
   advantaged over students who studied from a subject-specific curriculum
   on 3 end-of-year outcome measures: Test of Common Objectives, Problem
   Solving and Reasoning Test, and a standardized achievement test.
   Opportunity to learn and teaching experience were significant moderating
   factors.},

Abstract = {This randomized controlled trial conducted in Alaska examined the
   efficacy of 2 second-grade modules of the reform-oriented and culturally
   based Math in a Cultural Context (MCC) teacher training and curriculum.
   The results show that the Picking Berries (representing and measuring)
   and Going to Egg Island (grouping and place value) modules significantly
   improved students' mathematics performance, with relatively robust
   effect sizes (0.82 and 0.39 standard deviations, respectively, both
   statistically significant at the .001 level). Both modules increased the
   gains of Alaska Native students significantly (effect sizes of 1.00 and
   0.33 for the Picking Berries and Going to Egg Island modules,
   respectively). The analysis also revealed that the impacts were broad
   based. Significant impacts of the MCC modules were found for multiple
   conceptual areas. Moreover, the impacts were significant for most of the
   subgroups of schools and students examined.},

Abstract = {The overreliance on linear methods in students' reasoning and problem
   solving has been documented and discussed by several scholars in the
   field. So far, however, there have been no attempts to assemble the
   evidence and to analyze it in a systematic way. This article provides an
   overview and a conceptual analysis of students' tendency to use linear
   methods beyond their applicability range. We start from an analysis of
   the linearity concept and its properties and representations. The main
   part consists of a summary and discussion of unwarranted applications of
   each of these properties and representations in various mathematical
   content domains in order to unravel similarities and differences. After
   that, we speculate on the factors that seem to be at the roots of the
   occurrence and persistence of the overreliance on linearity. Finally, we
   discuss educational implications and suggest perspectives for further
   research.},

Abstract = {In this article, we deal with students' algebraic generalizations set in
   the context of elementary geometric-numeric patterns. Drawing from
   Vygotsky's psychology, Leont'ev's Activity Theory, and Husserl's
   phenomenology, we focus on the various semiotic resources mobilized by
   students in their passage from the particular to the general. Two small
   groups of Grade 9 students are investigated through a four-dimensional
   analysis: video, audio, transcripts, and written material. The resulting
   qualitative analysis shows how discourse, gestures, actions, and rhythms
   orchestrate one another and how, through a complex and subtle
   coordination of them, the students objectify different aspects of their
   spatial-temporal mathematical experience. The analysis also suggests
   connections between the syntax of the students' algebraic formulas and
   the semiotic means of objectification through which the formulas were
   forged, thereby shedding some light on the meaning of students'
   algebraic expression. Some implications for the teaching and learning of
   mathematics are discussed.},

Abstract = {The study reported here investigated the arithmetical and algebraic
   problem-solving strategies and skills of preservice primary school and
   secondary school teachers in Flanders, Belgium, both at the beginning
   and at the end of their teacher training. The study then compared these
   aspects of the preservice teachers' own problem-solving behavior with
   the way in which they evaluated students' arithmetical and algebraic
   solutions to problems. Future secondary school teachers clearly
   preferred the use of algebra, both in their own solutions and in their
   evaluations of students' work, even when an arithmetical solution seemed
   more evident. Some future primary school teachers tended to apply
   exclusively arithmetical methods, leading to numerous failures on
   difficult word problems, whereas others were quite adaptive in their
   strategy choices. Taken as a whole, the evaluations of the preservice
   primary school teachers were more closely adapted to the nature of the
   task than those of-their secondary school counterparts.},

Abstract = {We have attempted to investigate whether 3 cognitive components of
   language proficiency-metalinguistic awareness of symbol, syntax, and
   ambiguity-are associated with students' success in learning the notation
   of algebra. Pencil-and-paper tests were given to assess students'
   metalinguistic awareness and their ability to use algebraic notation. In
   a total sample of more than 1500 students, aged 11 to 15, who were in
   their Ist to 4th years of algebra learning, we found that very few
   students with low metalinguistic awareness scores achieved high algebra
   scores. We discuss implications of this finding for the school algebra
   curriculum.},

Abstract = {Ln this study I examine the value of concept maps as instruments for
   assessment of conceptual understanding, using the maps to compare the
   knowledge of function that students enrolled in university calculus
   classes hold. Twenty-eight students, half from nontraditional sections
   and half from traditional sections, participated in the study. Eight
   professors with PhDs in mathematics also completed concept maps. These
   expert maps are compared with the student maps. Qualitative analysis of
   the maps reveals differences between the student and expert groups as
   well as between the 2 student groups. Concept maps proved to be a useful
   device for assessing conceptual understanding.},

Abstract = {This study investigates relationships between a beginning elementary
   school teacher's beliefs and mathematics teaching practices. A proposed
   model of relationships between beliefs and practice provided a
   conceptual framework for the examination of factors that influence
   beliefs, practice, and the level of inconsistency between them. Data
   were gathered over 10 months through audiotaped interviews,
   observations, document analysis, and a beliefs survey. Analyses included
   the categorization and comparison of beliefs and practice and the
   development of a revised model of relationships between beliefs and
   practice. Findings indicate that this teacher's beliefs and practice
   were not wholly consistent Rather, her practice was more closely related
   to her beliefs about mathematics content than to her beliefs about
   mathematics pedagogy. Her beliefs about mathematics content were highly
   influenced by her own experiences as a student and her beliefs about
   mathematics pedagogy were primarily influenced by her own teaching
   practice. However, the extent to which her teacher preparation program
   influenced either her beliefs or practice was limited.},

Abstract = {The mathematical problems generated by 509 middle school students, who
   were given a brief written `'story-problem'' description and asked to
   pose questions that could be answered using the information, were
   examined for solvability, linguistic and mathematical complexity, and
   relationships within the sets of posed problems. It was found that
   students generated a large number of solvable mathematical problems,
   many of which were syntactically and semantically complex, and that
   nearly half the students generated sets of related problems. Subjects
   also solved eight fairly complex problems, and the relationship between
   their problem-solving performance and their problem posing was examined
   to reveal that `'good'' problem solvers generated more mathematical
   problems and more complex problems than `'poor'' problem solvers did.
   The multiple-step data analysis scheme developed and used herein should
   be useful to teachers and other researchers interested in evaluating
   students' posing of arithmetic story problems.},

Abstract = {Responses to word problems involving rates of change were collected on
   four occasions during and after 24 hours of concept-based calculus
   instruction given to a group of first-year university students, all of
   whom had studied calculus in secondary school. The number of students
   who could symbolize rates of change in noncomplex situations increased
   dramatically. However, there was almost no increase in the number who
   could symbolize rates of change in complex items or in items that
   required modeling a situation using algebraic variables. Detailed
   analysis revealed three main categories of error, in all of which
   variables are treated as symbols to be manipulated rather than as
   quantities to be related. We surmise that the students had developed an
   `'abstract-apart'' concept of a variable rather than the
   `'abstract-general'' concept that is needed for the successful study of
   calculus.},

Abstract = {The representational view of mind in mathematics education is evidenced
   by theories that characterize learning as a process in which students
   modify their internal mental representations to construct mathematical
   relationships or structures that mirror those embodied in external
   instructional representations. It is argued that, psychologically, this
   view falls prey to the learning paradox, that, anthropologically, it
   fails to consider the social and cultural nature of mathematical
   activity and that, pedagogically, it leads to recommendations that are
   at odds with the espoused goal of encouraging learning with
   understanding. These difficulties are seen to arise from the dualism
   created between mathematics in students' heads and mathematics in their
   environment. An alternative view is then outlined and illustrated that
   attempts to transcend this dualism by treating mathematics as both an
   individual, constructive activity and as a communal, social practice. It
   is suggested that such an approach might make it possible to explain how
   students construct mathematical meanings and practices that,
   historically, took several thousand years to evolve without attributing
   to students the ability to peek around their internal representations
   and glimpse a mathematically prestructured environment. In addition, it
   is argued that this approach might offer a way to go beyond the
   traditional tripartite scheme of the teacher, the student, and
   mathematics that has traditionally guided reform efforts in mathematics
   education.},

   specialized content knowledge (SCK) for teaching 12 mathematical topics
   addressed to varying degrees in the preparation program. We found that
   instructional time was positively associated with SCK demonstrated both
   imme-diately postgraduation and 2 years later. Several possible
   confounding factors were assessed; one, entering PSTs??? average SCK for
   topics, appeared to influence the relationship. Accounting for
   professional learning postgraduation, such as attending professional
   development, did not change the underlying relationship. Considering
   these findings, we identify policy implications for the math-ematics
   curriculum of PST education.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the implementation of inquiry-oriented
   instruction in 20 undergraduate mathematics classrooms. In contrast to
   conventional wisdom that active learning is good for all students, we
   found gendered performance differences between women and men in the
   inquiry classes that were not present in a noninquiry comparison sample.
   Through a secondary analysis of classroom videos, we linked these
   performance inequities to differences in women???s participation rates
   across classes. Thus, we provide empirical evidence that simply
   implementing active learning is insufficient, and that the nature of
   inquiry-oriented classrooms is highly consequential for improving gender
   equity in mathematics.},

Abstract = {Even when parents have the time required to support their children's
   education, they can increase their children's anxiety about school when
   they try to help, especially if they are not confident in their own
   abilities. This study measures the effects of having parents complete
   nonacademic schoolwork with their teenage children. Half of the 422
   participating parents were randomly assigned to receive weekly
   assignments for nonacademic activities to complete with their children,
   whereas the other half received information about upcoming mathematics
   tests. Mathematics-anxious students benefitexd from working on the
   nonacademic assignments, performing significantly better on their
   mathematics tests and decreasing their mathematics anxiety after
   treatment. These findings highlight the importance of involving parents
   in ways that feel nonthreatening to their children.},

Abstract = {In a cross-sectional study, 160 students in Grades 2, 4, 7, and 11 were
   interviewed about their reasoning when solving integer addition and
   subtraction open-number sentence problems. We applied our previously
   developed framework for 5 Ways of Reasoning (WoRs) to our data set to
   describe patterns within and across participant groups. Our analysis of
   the WoRs also led to the identification of 3 problem types:
   change-positive, all-negatives, and counterintuitive. We found that
   problem type influenced student performance and tended to evoke a
   different way of reasoning. We showed that those with more experience
   with negative numbers use WoRs more flexibly than those with less
   experience and that flexibility is correlated with accuracy. We provide
   3 types of resources for educators: (a) WoRs and problem-types
   frameworks, (b) characterization of flexibility with integer addition
   and subtraction, and (c) development of a trajectory of learning about
   integers.},

Abstract = {The moment-to-moment dynamics of student discourse plays a large role in
   students' enacted mathematics identities. Discourse analysis was used to
   describe meaningful discursive patterns in the interactions of 2
   students in a 7th-grade, technology-based, curricular unit (SimCalc
   MathWorlds (R)) and to show how mathematics identities are enacted at
   the microlevel. Frameworks were theoretically and empirically connected
   to identity to characterize the participants' relative positioning and
   the structural patterns in their discourse (e.g., who talks, who
   initiates sequences, whose ideas are taken up and publicly recognized).
   Data indicated that students' peer-to-peer discourse patterns explained
   the enactment of differing mathematics identities within the same local
   context. Thus, the ways people talk and interact are powerful influences
   on who they are, and can become, with respect to mathematics.},

Abstract = {This Brief Report summarizes case studies of the classroom teaching
   practices of 2 algebra teachers. The data consist of videotaped
   classroom observations during I academic year. The study identifies and
   characterizes specific teaching practices that establish the norm that
   the teacher is the sole arbiter of mathematical correctness in the
   classroom. The authors suggest that these practices are likely to
   promote the development of the authoritative proof scheme in students.
   The results can provide a basis for future research investigating the
   prevalence of these teaching practices and their impact on student
   learning, and they can be used as parameters to investigate teacher
   change.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the results of a study that investigated the
   strategic representation skills of eighth-grade students while they were
   engaged in a set of tasks that involved applying geometric knowledge and
   using algebraic equations. The strategies studied were derived from Dual
   Coding Theory (DCT) (Paivio, 1971, 1990), and they were elicited with
   task-specific prompts embedded in an assessment developed for the study.
   The purpose of the studs was to test a model that highlights strategic
   representation as a mediator of the effects of reading ability, spatial
   ability, and task presentation on problem solving. The Proposed model
   was tested using the linear structural equations modeling approach to
   causal analysis and the data did not reject the model. The results
   showed that students' use of symbols, words, and diagrams to communicate
   about their ideas each contribute in different ways to solving tasks and
   reflect different kinds of cognitive processes invested in problem
   solving.},

Abstract = {Some researchers have expressed doubts about the potential of
   reform-oriented curricula to promote equity. This article considers this
   important issue and argues that investigations into equitable teaching
   must pay attention to the particular practices of teaching and learning
   that are enacted in classrooms. Data are presented from two studies in
   which middle school and high school teachers using reform-oriented
   mathematics curricula achieved a reduction in linguistic, ethnic, and
   class inequalities in their schools. The teaching and learning practices
   that these teachers employed were central to the attainment of equality,
   suggesting that it is critical that relational analyses of equity go
   beyond the curriculum to include the teacher and their teaching.},

Abstract = {This article describes a two-year longitudinal study that tracked seven
   students through a one-year, full-time, university-based secondary
   mathematics method course and into their first year of teaching in the
   Western Cape province of South Africa, The purpose of the study was to
   describe the recontextualizing from the mathematics method course by
   these beginning teachers, Qualitative analysis of the teacher education
   course, of students' positioning in relation to this course, and later
   of their positioning in relation to teachers and learner in schools, was
   conducted. The results showed that beginning teachers drew in two ways
   from the method course: they reproduced a small number of discrete
   task,, that had been introduced to them there, and they also deployed a
   professional argot-a way of talking about teaching and learning
   mathematics. This recontextualizing was shaped by the beginning
   teachers' educational biographies and school contexts, but most
   particularly by access to recognition and realization rules.},

Abstract = {We propose an approach to the theoretical and empirical identification
   processes of abstraction in context. Although our outlook is
   theoretical, our thinking about abstraction emerges from the analysis of
   interview data. We consider abstraction an activity of vertically
   reorganizing previously constructed mathematics into a new mathematical
   structure. We use the term activity to emphasize that abstraction is a
   process with a history; it may capitalize on tools and other artifacts,
   and it occurs in a particular social setting. We present the core of a
   model for the genesis of abstraction. The principal components of the
   model are three dynamically nested epistemic actions: constructing,
   recognizing, and building-with. To study abstraction is to identify
   these epistemic actions of students participating in an activity of
   abstraction.},

Abstract = {Prototypes are used as references to cope with new examples in concept
   learning. Prototypes can, however, he detrimental to concept learning,
   as shown in the use of linear functions for learning the function
   concept. This research characterizes students' function concept images
   that arise in an interactive environment based on multirepresentational
   software. We capitalize on a 20-year curricular program to contrast the
   concepts students develop in this environment with those developed in
   traditional environments. We show that students who are learning
   functions in the interactive environment (a) often use prototypic
   functions (linear and quadratic) but do not consider them as exclusive,
   (b) use prototypes as levers to handle a variety of other examples, (c)
   articulate justifications often accounting for context, and (d)
   understand functions' attributes.},

Abstract = {In this article, using reform recommendations that call for parental
   involvement as a springboard, I provide an analysis of the positioning
   of parents in the school mathematics reform literature. Employing
   Foucault's (1980) conception of ``regimes of truth,{''} I demonstrate
   how the literature has created the accepted discourse for mathematics
   education reform. I then argue that the professionalization of teachers
   has distanced parents from schools and led to conflict between parents
   and mathematics educators and that to reconcile this conflict, ways in
   which parents can be included in mathematics education must be
   considered. It is essential first, however, to understand issues central
   to involving parents in mathematics education. A research agenda for
   parental involvement in mathematics education is presented.},

Abstract = {In this study we examined the problem-solving characteristics, strategy
   selection and use, and verification actions of 24 African American
   8th-grade students. Students participated in individual, talk-aloud
   problem-solving sessions and were interviewed about their problem
   solutions and attitudes about learning mathematics. Students displayed
   approaches attributed to African American learners in the literature,
   regularly using holistic rather than analytic reasoning; their display
   of confidence and high self-esteem did not appear to be related to
   success. Students' problem-solving actions matched previously reported
   characteristics of good mathematical problem solvers: successful use of
   strategies, flexibility in approach, use of verification actions, and
   ability to deal with irrelevant detail. Success was highly correlated
   with strategy selection and use and moderately correlated with
   verification actions.},

Number = {4},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {One major part of the effort to reform secondary school mathematics is
   the project of changing the goal of studying school algebra from the
   mastery of symbolic manipulations to the ability to reason
   algebraically. Another major component of these reform efforts is the
   creation of opportunities for students to communicate within and about
   mathematics. The ability to generalize, especially when the
   generalization requires a major breakthrough in habits of mind, is one
   indication of algebraic reasoning. In this article, I describe
   generalization activity as an opportunity to learn about seventh
   graders' understanding of functions. A group of students who had studied
   functions modeled a multivariable situation. Through individual and
   group work, they designed, described, and discussed various
   representations for functions of 2 variables. Their modeling efforts
   allowed them to analyze their understanding of representations of
   quantities, relationships among quantities, and relationships among the
   representations of quantities in both single- and multivariable
   functions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {478-504},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Sixteen middle school students ranked the lengths of various paths in
   two audiotaped problem-solving interviews. Every student invoked at
   least one of four intuitions that originated from their everyday
   experiences: compression, detour, complexity, and straightness. After
   their intuitions proved inadequate in the pretest, they were taught an
   applicable algorithm. However, they used their intuitions again during
   the posttest before applying the instructed algorithm. The reuse of the
   inadequate intuitions demonstrates their robustness and their continued
   higher cueing priority despite the presence of the successful algorithm.
   When students applied multiple intuitions that conflicted, they often
   vacillated. Eventually, most students chose one. Nevertheless, they
   continued using the rejected intuition to compare other paths. As a
   result, their problem solving suggests that their intuitions are
   sparsely connected fragments. On the other hand, when intuitions support

Abstract = {Thirty-six students, twelve each at the fourth-, sixth-, and eight-grade
   levels, were asked to solve 21 comparison-of-area tasks during a
   clinical interview.  The areas were partitioned and shaded so that the
   tasks could be solved by using rational number knowledge.  The types of
   strategies students used to compare the areas were identified and
   classified into categories.  Initially, fractional terms and symbols
   were not introduced into the tasks in order to compare the types of
   strategies students used without and with symbols introduced.  Most
   students tended to ignore the part-whole relationships inherent in the
   tasks and used a Direct Comparison strategy when they compared the
   areas.  The use of a Part-Whole strategy increased with the introduction
   of fractional terms and symbols, especially at the eight-grade level.},

Abstract = {Twenty primary teachers were interviewed who, three or four years
   earlier, had participated in in-service workshops on Cognitively Guided
   Instruction (CGI).  Three patterns of CGI use seemed related to the
   meanings teachers constructed for CGI itself.  Teachers who reported
   developing their use of CGI until it formed the mainstay of their
   mathematics teaching saw CGI conceptually.  They also reported learning
   mainly through their interactions with students and other teachers and
   developing beliefs about the conceptual nature of mathematics, the
   constructivist nature of learning, and the students' central role in
   that learning.  Teachers who reported never having used CGI more than
   supplementally saw CGI as a group of procedures and espoused more
   traditional beliefs in these areas.  Teachers who reported using CGI
   more at first, but less currently, showed a marked incongruity between
   their espoused beliefs and reported practices.  The authors ask whether
   additional researcher support, collegial interaction, or perhaps
   prescriptiveness in the intervention might have helped teachers in this
   third group enact their conceptually based beliefs.},

Title = {Solving Equations: Exploring Instructional Exchanges as Lenses to

Abstract = {Many research studies have sought to explain why NCTM's vision for
   mathematics classrooms has not had greater impact on everyday
   instruction, with teacher beliefs often identified as an explanatory
   variable. Using instructional exchanges as a theoretical construct, this
   study explores the influence of teachers' institutional positions on the
   solving of equations in algebra classrooms. The experimental design uses
   surveys with embedded rich-media representations of classroom
   interaction to surface how teachers appraise correct solutions to linear
   equations where some solutions follow suggested textbook procedures for
   solving linear equations and others do not. This paper illustrates the
   feasibility of studying teaching with rich-media surveys and suggests
   new ways to support changes in everyday mathematics teaching.},

Abstract = {The belief that mathematics ability is a fixed trait is particularly
   common and may be a key reason for many students' disinterest and
   underperformance in mathematics. This study investigates how mathematics
   teaching practices might contribute to students' beliefs about
   mathematics ability being a fixed or malleable trait (mindset). Through
   a synthesis of existing literature and an analysis of data from
   classroom observations, this article presents a framework of teaching
   practices and identifies how varying implementations of these practices
   can be classified along a continuum from conveying fixed-mindset
   messages to conveying growth-mindset messages related to mathematics
   ability.},

Abstract = {We examined the codevelopment of mathematical concepts and the
   mathematical practice of defining within a sixth-grade class
   investigating space and geometry. Drawing upon existing literature, we
   present a framework for describing forms of participation in defining,
   what we term aspects of definitional practice. Analysis of classroom
   interactions during 16 episodes spanning earlier and later phases of
   instruction illustrate how student participation in aspects of
   definitional practice influenced their emerging conceptions of the
   geometry of shape and form and how emerging conceptions of shape and
   form provided opportunities to develop and elaborate aspects of
   definitional practice. Several forms of teacher discourse appeared to
   support students' participation and students' increasing agency over
   time. These included: (a) requesting that members of the class
   participate in various aspects of practice, (b) asking questions that
   serve to expand the mathematical system, (c) modeling participation in
   aspects of practice, (d) proposing examples that create contest (i.e.,
   monsters), and (e) explicitly stating expectations of and purposes for
   participating in the practice.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-68},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, the mathematics education research community has
   incorporated more sociocultural perspectives into its ways of
   understanding and examining teaching and learning. However, researchers
   who have a long history of addressing anti-racism and social justice
   issues in mathematics have moved beyond this sociocultural view to
   espouse sociopolitical concepts and theories, highlighting identity and
   power at play. This article highlights some promising conceptual tools
   from critical theory (including critical race theory/Latcrit theory) and
   post-structuralism and makes an argument for why taking the
   sociopolitical turn is important for both researchers and practitioners.
   Potential benefits and challenges of this turn are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Kaminski, Sloutsky, and Heckler (2008a) published in Science a study on
   ``The advantage of abstract examples in learning math,{''} in which they
   claim that students may benefit more from learning mathematics through a
   single abstract, symbolic representation than from multiple concrete
   examples. This publication elicited both enthusiastic and critical
   comments by mathematicians, mathematics educators, and policy-makers
   worldwide. The current empirical study involves a partial
   replication-but also an important validation and extension-of this
   widely noticed study. The study's results confirm Kaminski et al.'s
   findings, but the accompanying qualitative data raise serious questions
   about their interpretation of what students actually learned from the
   abstract concept exemplification. Moreover, whereas Kaminski et al.
   showed that abstract learners transferred what they had learned to a
   similar abstract context, this study shows also that students who
   learned from concrete examples transferred their knowledge into a
   similar concrete context.},

Abstract = {We present a case study of teaching and learning fraction addition on
   number lines in one 6th-grade classroom that used the Connected
   Mathematics Project Bits and Pieces II materials. Our main research
   questions were (1) What were the primary cognitive structures through
   which the teacher and students interpreted the lessons? and (2) Were the
   teacher's and her students' interpretations similar or different, and
   why? The data afforded particularly detailed analyses of cognitive
   structures used by the teacher and one student to interpret fractions
   and their representation on number lines. Our results demonstrate that
   subtle differences in methods for partitioning unit intervals did not
   seem important to the teacher but had significant consequences for this
   student's opportunities to learn. Our closing discussion addresses
   knowledge for teaching with drawn representations and methods for
   examining interactions between teachers' and students' interpretations
   of lessons in which they participate together.},

   calculus curricula has largely focused on changes in achievement and
   attitudes, generally ignoring how students experience these new
   programs. This study was designed to address that deficit. As part of a
   larger effort to characterize students' transitions into and out of
   reform programs, we analyzed how 93 high school and college students
   perceived Standards-based and reform calculus programs as different from
   traditional ones. Results show considerable diversity across and even
   within sites. Nearly all students reported differences, but high-impact
   differences, like Content, were not always related to curriculum type
   (reform or traditional). Students' perceptions aligned moderately well
   with those of reform curriculum authors, e.g., concerning Typical
   Problems. These results show that students' responses to reform programs
   can be quite diverse and only partially aligned with adults' views.},

Abstract = {Mathematics educators recognize the impact of students' attitudes,
   beliefs, and views about mathematics on their learning and use of
   mathematics. A reform goal is for students to develop a productive
   mathematical disposition, one that reflects the disposition of
   professional mathematicians. This may not be the most appropriate model
   for most students, and other mathematical dispositions may be possible
   and productive. This ethnographic study investigated the mathematical
   disposition of engineers. Structural engineers in two firms were
   observed in everyday practice. Observation and interview data were
   analyzed to elucidate the role of mathematics in solving engineering
   problems and the engineers' perceptions of the status of mathematics
   relative to other resources and constraints. The phenomenon of
   ``engineering judgment{''} was found to shape the role of mathematics in
   engineering work and render the engineers' mathematical disposition-of
   ``skeptical reverence{''}-distinct from the disposition currently
   developed in schools.},

Abstract = {The relationship between normative patterns of social interaction and
   children's mathematical thinking was investigated in 5 classes (4 reform
   and I conventional) of 7- to 8-year-olds. In earlier studies, lessons
   from these classes had been analyzed for the nature of interaction
   broadly defined; the results indicated the existence of 4 types of
   classroom cultures (conventional textbook, conventional problem solving,
   strategy reporting, and inquiry/argument). In the current study, 42
   lessons from this data resource were analyzed for children's
   mathematical thinking as verbalized in class discussions and for
   interaction patterns. These analyses were then combined to explore the
   relationship between interaction types and expressed mathematical
   thinking. The results suggest that increased complexity in children's
   expressed mathematical thinking was closely related to the types of
   interaction patterns that differentiated class discussions among the 4
   classroom cultures.},

Abstract = {We present here results of a case study examining the classroom practice
   of one third-grade teacher as she participated in a long-term
   professional development project led by the authors. Our goal was to
   explore in what ways and to what extent the teacher was able to build a
   classroom that supported the development of students' algebraic
   reasoning skills. We analyzed I year of her classroom instruction to
   determine the robustness with which she integrated algebraic reasoning
   into the regular course of daily instruction and its subsequent impact
   on students' ability to reason algebraically. We took the diversity of
   types of algebraic reasoning, their frequency and form of integration,
   and techniques of instructional practice that supported students'
   algebraic reasoning as a measure of the robustness of her capacity to
   build algebraic reasoning. Results indicate that the teacher was able to
   integrate algebraic reasoning into instruction in planned and
   spontaneous ways that led to positive shifts in students' algebraic
   reasoning skills.},

Abstract = {This article explores the complex relationship between language and
   mathematics education in multilingual settings by presenting an analysis
   of one lesson from a multilingual primary mathematics classroom in South
   Africa taught by an appropriately qualified and experienced teacher.
   English emerged as a dominant language in this classroom, and this
   dominance was accompanied by procedural mathematics discourse. The
   learners' home language functioned mainly as the language of solidarity,
   whereas English functioned as the language of mathematics, authority,
   and assessment. The article argues for the need to recognize and
   acknowledge the political role of language when conducting research into
   the relationship between language and mathematics education in
   multilingual classrooms. The article draws implications for making
   critical, influential decisions about curriculum, assessment, and
   teacher education.},

Abstract = {This article by the NCTM's Research Committee presents a call for an
   Agenda for Research Action in Mathematics Education. The committee
   reviews central crosscutting issues for mathematics education research
   that address concerns from the political and practitioner communities
   regarding the coherence and utility of mathematics education research.
   Issues of values and feasibility are highlighted, and a broader
   definition of theoretical and empirical scholarship is promoted. The
   committee proposes that the mathematics education research community
   take up the mantle of authority for defining rigor and evidence in much
   the same way as NCTM did when facing similar criticism in earlier crises
   (e.g., the Agenda for Action and the Standards).},

Abstract = {The Learning Principle propounded in Principles and Standards for School
   Mathematics (NCTM, 2000) rehearses the familiar distinction between
   facts/procedures and understanding as a central guiding principle of
   teaching reform. This rhetorical stance has polarized mathematics
   educators in the ``math wars,{''} (Becker \& Jacob, 1998), while
   creating the discursive space for mathematics teaching reform to be
   reified into a unitary ``reform vision{''} (Lindquist, Ferrini-Mundy, \&
   Kilpatrick, 1997)-a vision that teachers can all too easily come to see
   themselves as implementing rather than authoring. Crossdisciplinarity is
   a strategy for highlighting the discrete notions of learning that
   psychology thus far has succeeded in coherently articulating. This
   strategy positions teachers to consult their own values, interests, and
   strengths in defining their own teaching priorities, at the same time
   marshaling accessible, theory-based guidance toward realization of its
   diverse possibilities.},

Abstract = {Longitudinal analyses of the mathematical achievement and beliefs of 3
   groups of elementary pupils are presented The groups consist of those
   students who had received 2 years of problem-centered mathematics
   instruction, those who had received 1 year, and those who had received
   textbook instruction. Comparisons are made for the groups using a
   standardized norm-referenced achievement test from first through fourth
   grade. Next, student comparisons are made using instruments developed to
   measure conceptual understanding of arithmetic and beliefs and
   motivation for learning mathematics. The results of the analyses
   indicate that after 2 years in problem-centered classes, students have
   significantly higher achievement on standardized achievement measures,
   better conceptual understanding, and more task-oriented beliefs for
   learning mathematics than do those in textbook instruction. In addition
   these differences remain after problem-centered students return to
   classes using textbook instruction. Comparisons of pupils in
   problem-centered classes for only 1 year reveal that after returning to
   textbook instruction, these students' mathematical achievement and
   beliefs are more similar to the textbook group. Also included are
   exploratory analyses of the pedagogical beliefs held by teachers before
   and after teaching in problem-centered classes, and those held by
   teachers in textbook classes. The results of the student and teacher
   analyses are interpreted in light of research on children's construction
   of nonstandard algorithms and the nature of classroom environments.},

Abstract = {This research extended the validation of a framework for assessing and
   describing children's thinking in multidigit number situations and used
   this framework to generate and evaluate different versions of an
   instructional program. The key constructs of the framework-counting,
   partitioning, grouping, and number relationships-appeared to be highly
   stable within each of the five levels and across the full range of
   thinking exhibited by 12 case studies. Results suggest that the levels
   may generate a hierarchy of thinking. Teachers were effective in
   implementing two versions of the framework-driven instructional program.
   Any differences could be attributed to the quality of problem-solving
   experiences, the level of student interactions, and, in essence, to
   differences in teachers' familiarity with the program.},

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between teachers' and students'
   personal constructs with regard to intrinsic motivation in the
   mathematics classroom.  The research focused on (a) the ways in which
   teachers attempted to build student motivation into their lessons and
   (b) the belief systems of teachers as compared to those of their
   students.  In a repertory grid task, students and teachers were asked to
   distinguish what they believed makes mathematics motivating.  Results
   revealed that the individuals studied, whether teachers or students,
   were similar in their constructs systems.  Both students and teachers
   tended to stress the interrelationship between arousal and control
   levels in determining the intrinsic motivation of mathematics
   activities.  Despite these similarities, the extent to which teachers
   can anticipate the motivation of their students may depend more on
   teachers' personal conceptions of intrinsic motivation than their
   beliefs about their students.  Most of the teachers studied had little
   notion of the motivational beliefs of their students.  Results are
   examined in relation to the need to inform teachers regarding the
   dynamics of student motivation and to pay particular attention to the
   individual differences in students' motivational beliefs.  In general,
   results indicate that when teachers are able to predict their students'
   beliefs, they are better able to fine-tune their instruction to turn
   kids on to mathematics.},

Abstract = {Exponential and logarithmic functions are typically presented as
   formulas with which students learn to associate the rules for
   exponents/logarithms, a particular algebraic form, and routine
   algorithms.  We present a theoretical argument for an approach to
   exponentials more closely related to students' constructions.  This
   approach is based on a primitive multiplicative operation labeled
   `'splitting'' that is not repeated addition.  Whereas educators
   traditionally rely on counting structures to build a number system, we
   suggest that students need the opportunity to build a number system from
   splitting structures and their geometric forms.  We advocate a
   `'covariation'' approach to functions that supports a construction of
   the exponential function based on an isomorphism between splitting and
   counting structures.},

Abstract = {This article is a report of a study of relationships between intended,
   implemented, and tested curricula of 84 classes of United States
   eighth-grade mathematics students in 1981-82. It is based on data from
   the Second International Mathematics Study (SIMS, Population A) and the
   SIMS test: 180 multiple-choice questions covering topics in arithmetic,
   algebra, geometry, measurement, and statistics. The study focused on
   three areas: (a) coverage of the SIMS test items in six nonalgebra
   textbooks, (b) teacher reports of whether students had the opportunity
   to learn the SIMS items, and (c) teacher expectations for student
   success on the SIMS items. Of special concern was the challenge
   presented to students as measured by textbook and teacher coverage of
   new, versus reviewed, mathematics topics.
   The analysis indicated that the SIMS test for eighth graders was not
   representative of the curriculum defined by students' texts. The books
   were heavily biased toward a review of arithmetic and away from algebra
   or geometry items. Items new to texts were among the least covered.
   Teacher expectations for student success mirrored the textbook coverage
   of SIMS items and indicated a high degree of reliance on textbooks for
   topic sequencing. Teachers using nonbasal texts had higher expectations
   than teachers of basal texts. Teachers reported that they taught more
   old items than new items and more arithmetic and algebra items than
   geometry, measurement, or statistics items.},

Abstract = {This article presents a philosophical and pragmatic critique of critical
   mathematics (CM) and current vocational mathematics (VM) in the United
   States. I argue that, despite differences, CM and VM advocates share the
   view that the inauthentic contextualization of secondary mathematics
   does particular harm to students from historically marginalized groups
   and that the subject therefore should be recontextualized to address
   their lived experiences and apparent futures. Drawing on sociological
   theory, I argue that, in being responsive to so-called authentic
   real-world concerns, CM and VM fail to be responsive to the
   self-referential principles and specialized discourses necessary for
   future study of mathematics and,as such, may further disempower the very
   students that CM and VM advocates seek to empower.},

Abstract = {We build on mathematicians??? descriptions of their work and
   conceptualize mathematics as an aesthetic endeavor. Invoking the
   anthropological meaning of practice, we claim that mathematical
   aesthetic practices shape meanings of and appreciation (or distaste) for
   particular manifestations of mathematics. To see learners??? spontaneous
   mathematical aesthetic practices, we situate our study in an informal
   context featuring design-centered play with mathematical objects.
   Drawing from video data that support inferences about children???s
   perspectives, we use interaction analysis to examine one child???s
   mathematical aesthetic practices, highlighting the emergence of
   aesthetic problems whose resolution required engagement in mathematics
   sense making. As mathematics educators seek to broaden access, our
   empirical findings challenge commonsense understandings about what and
   where mathematics is, opening possibilities for designs for learning.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the interplay of time words with how children
   position hands on an analog clock. Using a mathematics discourse
   framework (Sfard, 2008), we analyzed how students interpreted precise
   (e.g., 2:30) and relative (e.g., half past 11) times, finding that
   particular words are dynamically interwoven with activity. Interviews
   with students in Grades 2 and 4 revealed that different prompts led to
   different narrative descriptions about time on the clock, with precise
   times leading to whole-number descriptions and relative times to
   part-whole descriptions consistent with fractions. Subsequent analysis
   of assessment performance for students across Grades 2-5 corroborated
   that specific time prompts led to particular clock interpretations.
   Implications for theory and the K-12 treatment of time measure are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Counting is fundamental to early mathematics. Most studies of teaching
   counting focus on teachers observing children count. The present study
   compares mathematical ideas that 12 PK, transitional kindergarten (TK),
   and kindergarten teachers noticed from observing their own students
   count during a classroom session of Counting Collections with ideas that
   they noticed outside class time in the same students' representations of
   counting on paper. Inviting teacher noticing in representations (a) drew
   attention to distinct conceptions that children required to represent
   counting; (b) increased the number of mathematical ideas that
   participants perceived in students' thinking; and (c) helped
   participants perceive different levels in, and their own uncertainties
   about, students' understanding. This study suggests that teacher
   noticing in children's representations of counting can deepen teachers'
   understanding of students' mathematical thinking.},

Abstract = {We compared students' learning gains in authentic seventh-grade
   classrooms (N= 144) in 4 different interventions that incorporated a
   computer game that aims to tatch players to solve linear equations.
   Significantly higher learning gains were measured in the implementations
   that were specifically designed to mediate the attribution of algebraic
   meaning to objects, actions, and rule in the game by engaging students
   in analogical mapping between these constructs and their algebraic
   counterparts and an exploration of the boundaries of this isomorphism.
   These findings suggest that learning disciplinary content and skills
   from a digital game requires learners to attribute disciplinary meaning
   to objects, actions, and rules in the game. Moreover, this process does
   not necessarily occur spontaneously and benefits from instructional
   mediation.},

   Students: A Critical Race Analysis of Their Experiences},

Abstract = {The stories of high-achieving African American mathematics students are
   gaining prominence in the research literature. In this multiple case
   study, I use a critical race theoretical frame to document and analyze
   the experiences of 4 mathematically persistent African American male
   students who earned undergraduate degrees in mathematics and
   subsequently enrolled in mathematics or mathematics education graduate
   programs. The findings reveal that these African American men drew from
   internal factors to influence their mathematical persistence and
   identified how racial microaggressions manifest themselves in
   postundergraduate contexts. Recommendations for practice, policy
   implications, and future research directions that emerged from this
   study are discussed to better understand African American men's
   mathematics experiences.},

Abstract = {The efficacy of a research-based number-sense intervention for
   low-achieving kinder-gartners was examined. Children (N = 126) were
   randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: a number-sense intervention
   followed by a number-fact practice session, an identical number-sense
   intervention followed by a number-list practice session, or a
   business-as-usual control group. The interventions were delivered in a
   small-group setting over 24 half-hour lessons. Both intervention groups
   performed better than controls on measures of number sense, arithmetic
   fluency, and general mathematics calculation achievement at immediate
   posttest. However, the number-fact practice condition gave children an
   additional advantage over the number-list practice condition on the
   outcomes at delayed posttest 8 weeks later. The number-fact practice
   condition was especially effective for producing gains in English
   learners.},

Abstract = {Although policy documents promote teaching students multiple strategies
   for solving mathematics problems, some practitioners and researchers
   argue that struggling learners will be confused and overwhelmed by this
   instructional practice. In the current exploratory study, we explore how
   6 struggling students viewed the practice of learning multiple
   strategies at the end of a yearlong algebra course that emphasized this
   practice. Interviews with these students indicated that they preferred
   instruction with multiple strategies to their regular instruction, often
   noting that it reduced their confusion. We discuss directions for future
   research that emerged from this work.},

Abstract = {Research in experimental and developmental psychology, cognitive
   science, and neuroscience suggests that tool fluency depends on the
   merging of perceptual and motor aspects of its use, an achievement we
   call perceptuomotor integration. We investigate the development of
   perceptaomotor integration and its role in mathematical thinking and
   learning. Just as expertise in playing a piano relies on the
   interanimation of finger movements and perceived sounds, we argue that
   mathematical expertise involves the systematic interpenetration of
   perceptual and motor aspects of playing mathematical instruments.
   Through 2 microethnographic case studies of visitors who engaged with an
   interactive mathematics exhibit in a science museum, we explore the
   real-time emergence of perceptuomotor integration and the ways in which
   it supports mathematical imagination.},

Title = {Aspects of Students' Reasoning About Variation in Empirical Sampling
   Distributions},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {43},
Number = {5},
Pages = {509-556},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sampling tasks and sampling distributions provide a fertile realm for
   investigating students' conceptions of variability. A project-designed
   teaching episode on samples and sampling distributions was team-taught
   in 6 research classrooms (2 middle school and 4 high school) by the
   investigators and regular classroom mathematics teachers. Data sources
   included survey data collected in 6 research classes and 4 comparison
   classes both before and after the teaching episode, and semistructured
   task-based interviews conducted with students from the research classes.
   Student responses and reasoning on sampling tasks led to the development
   of a conceptual lattice that characterizes types of student reasoning
   about sampling distributions. The lattice may serve as a useful
   conceptual tool for researchers and as a potential instructional tool
   for teachers of statistics. Results suggest that teachers need to focus
   explicitly on multiple aspects of distributions, especially variability,
   to enhance students' reasoning about sampling distributions.},

Abstract = {The construct professional noticing of children's,mathematical thinking
   is introduced as a way to begin to unpack the in-the-moment decision
   making that is foundational to the complex view of teaching endorsed in
   national reform documents. We define this expertise as a set of
   interrelated skills including (a) attending to children's strategies,
   (b) interpreting children's understandings, and (c) deciding how to
   respond oil the basis of children's understandings. This construct was
   assessed ill a cross-sectional study of 13 1 prospective and practicing
   teachers, differing in the amount of experience they had with children's
   mathematical thinking. The findings help to characterize what this
   expertise entails; provide snapshots of those with varied levels of
   expertise; and document that, given time, this expertise can be learned.},

Abstract = {Solving arithmetic and algebraic word problems is a key component of the
   Singapore elementary mathematics curriculum. One heuristic taught, the
   model method, involves drawing a diagram to represent key information in
   the problem. We describe the model method and a three-phase theoretical
   framework supporting its use. We conducted 2 studies to examine
   teachers' perceptions and children's application of the model method.
   The subjects were 14 primary teachers from 4 schools and 151 Primary 5
   children. The model method affords higher ability children without
   access to letter-symbolic algebra a means to represent and solve
   algebraic word problems. Partly correct solutions suggest that
   representation is not an all-or-nothing process in which model drawing
   is either completely correct or completely incorrect. Instead, an
   incorrect solution could be the consequence of misrepresentation of a
   single piece of information. Our findings offer avenues of support in
   word problem solving to children of average ability.},

Abstract = {In this rejoinder to Baroody and colleagues (2007), 1 point out that
   there are several areas of agreement between my position and that of
   Baroody et almost notably that both procedural knowledge and conceptual
   knowledge are of critical importance in students' learning of
   mathematics. However, there are issues on which Baroody et al. and I do
   not agree. In particular, I elaborate on the idea that procedures can be
   known deeply, flexibly, and with critical judgment-positive learning
   outcomes that are exclusively about students' knowledge of procedures
   and not necessarily a result of connections to conceptual knowledge.},

Abstract = {In this article we describe gender gaps in mathematics achievement and
   attitude as measured by the U.S. National Assessment of Educational
   Progress (NAEP) from 1990 to 2003. Analyzing relationships among
   achievement and mathematical content, student proficiency and percentile
   levels, race, and socioeconomic status (SES), we found that gender gaps
   favoring males (1) were generally small but had not diminished across
   reporting years, (2) were largest in the areas of measurement, number
   and operations (in Grades 8 and 12) and geometry (in Grade 12), (3)
   tended to be concentrated at the upper end of the score distributions,
   and (4) were most consistent for White, high-SES students and
   non-existent for Black students. In addition, we found that female
   students' attitudes and self-concepts related to mathematics continued
   to be more negative than those of male students.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the first 4 years of an effort to develop
   comprehensive and sustainable mathematics education reforms in high
   poverty middle schools. In four related analyses, we examine the levels
   of implementation achieved and impact of the reforms on various measures
   of achievement in the first 3 schools to implement the Talent
   Development (TD) Middle School Model's mathematics program that combines
   coherent research-based instructional materials from the University of
   Chicago School Mathematics Project with a multi-tiered teacher support
   system of sustained professional development and in-class coaching. A
   moderate level of implementation was achieved. TD students outperformed
   students from control schools on multiple measures of achievement. The
   average effect size, Delta, by the end of middle school was .24.},

Abstract = {In this study we focus on math anxiety, comparing its dimensions,
   levels, and relationship with mathematics achievement across samples of
   6th-grade student!, from China. Taiwan, and the United States. The
   results of confirmatory factor analyses supported the theoretical
   distinction between affective and cognitive dimensions of math anxiety
   in all 3 national samples. The analyses of structural equation models
   provided evidence for the differential predictive validity of the 2
   dimensions of math anxiety. Specifically, across the 3 national samples,
   the affective factor of math anxiety was significantly related to
   mathematics achievement in the negative direction. Gender by nation
   interactions were also found to be significant for both affective and
   cognitive math anxiety.},

Abstract = {This article examines mathematics instruction and its intersection with
   culturally relevant teaching in an elementary/middle school in a Mexican
   American community. The findings are based on a collaborative-research
   and school-change project involving university researchers, teachers,
   and the school's principal. On the basis of ethnographic data and an
   interdisciplinary theoretical framework, we propose a three-part model
   of culturally relevant mathematics instruction. The 3 components are (a)
   building on students' informal mathematical knowledge and building on
   students' cultural and experiential knowledge, (b) developing tools of
   critical mathematical thinking and critical thinking about knowledge in
   general, and (c) orientations to students' culture and experience.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects on instruction of an intervention
   program designed to enhance teachers' knowledge of geometry and their
   knowledge of research on student cognition in geometry. Forty-nine
   middle-grade (4-8) teachers participated in a 4-week program consisting
   of a content course in geometry and a research seminar on van Hiele
   theory. The pretest and posttest results showed significant gains in
   content knowledge and in van Hiele level. The analysis of a lesson-plan
   task revealed a significant shift in goals and expectations to the next
   higher van Hiele level. Follow-up observations of 8 teachers found
   marked changes in what was taught, how it was taught, and the
   characteristics teachers displayed. Teachers attributed these changes to
   increased geometrical content knowledge and research-based knowledge of
   student cognition.},

Abstract = {Researchers from 4 projects with a problem-solving approach to teaching
   and learning multidigit number concepts and operations describe (a) a
   common framework of conceptual structures children construct for
   multidigit numbers and (b) categories of methods children devise for
   multidigit addition and subtraction. For each of the quantitative
   conceptual structures for 2-digit numbers, a somewhat different triad of
   relations is established between the number words, written 2-digit
   marks, and quantities. The conceptions are unitary, decade and ones,
   sequence-tens and ones, separate-tens and ones, and integrated
   sequence-separate conceptions. Conceptual supports used within each of
   the 4 projects are described and linked to multidigit addition and
   subtraction methods used by project children. Typical errors that may
   arise with each method are identified. We identify as crucial across all
   projects sustained opportunities for children to (a) construct triad
   conceptual structures that relate ten-structured quantities to number
   words and written 2-digit numerals and (b) use these triads in solving
   multidigit addition and subtraction situations.},

Abstract = {The assessment and grading practices in 19 mathematics classes in 5 high
   schools in 3 states were studied. In each class the most frequently used
   assessment tools were tests and quizzes, with these determining about
   77\% of students' grades. In 12 classes other forms of assessment, such
   as written projects or interviews with students, were also used, with
   performance on such instruments counting for about 7\% of students'
   grades averaged across all 19 classes. Test items generally were low
   level, were stated without reference to a realistic context, involved
   very little reasoning, and were almost never open-ended. Most test items
   were either neutral or inactive with respect to technology. Written
   projects usually involved more complex analyses or applications than
   tests did. The teachers' knowledge and beliefs, as well as the content
   and textbook of the course, influenced the characteristics of test items
   and other assessment instruments. Only in geometry classes did
   standardized tests appear to influence assessment.},

Abstract = {This study was undertaken to reevaluate whether preschoolers understand
   that counting in different orders yields the same number before they
   learn tag-reassigning skills. It also provided an opportunity to
   evaluate the explanations offered by Gelman and her colleagues. To avoid
   the interpretative difficulties of an earlier prediction task, the
   revised reverse-count prediction task proposed by Gelman, Meck, and
   Merkin (1986) was used. Nevertheless, a statistically significant number
   of subjects successfully implemented tag-reassigning skills but failed
   to predict that differently ordered counts would produce the same
   outcome. An error analysis indicated that children did not
   systematically add or subtract one, which might be expected if the
   children misinterpreted the tester's question (Gelman \& Greeno, 1989).
   Moreover, the evidence was clearly inconsistent with Gelman and Greeno's
   conjecture that children may err on the reverse-count prediction task to
   avoid the social awkwardness of repeating the obvious. Nor is it likely
   that children erred because they inferred that the experimenter required
   a different answer or because of fatigue or inattentiveness. The
   comments and actions of several children did indicate that they were
   doubtful about the outcome of recounting. In brief, the results seem
   most consistent with the view that children may not entirely understand
   the implications of their counting actions.},

Abstract = {Conceptually based instruction on place value and two-digit addition and
   subtraction without regrouping was provided in four first-grade
   classrooms, and more conventional textbook-based instruction was
   provided in two first-grade classrooms.  An observer compiled extensive
   notes of 20 lessons in each kind of classroom.  Students who received
   conceptually based instruction performed significantly better on items
   measuring understanding of place value and two-digit addition and
   subtraction with regrouping and used strategies more often that
   exploited the tens and ones structure of the number system.  Content and
   pedagogical differences between the instruction lessons are linked to
   the learning differences and are used to explain between-group
   differences in levels of performance and understanding.  Observations
   are offered on the complex interactions between instruction,
   understanding, and performance.},

Abstract = {This article proposes and employs a framework that characterizes
   mathematics education as a white, patriarchal space to analyze
   undergraduate Black women's narratives of experience in navigating P-16
   mathematics education. The framework guided a counter-storytelling
   analysis that captured variation in Black women's experiences of
   within-group tensions-a function of internalized racial-gendered
   ideologies and normalized structural inequities in mathematics
   education. Findings revealed variation in Black women's resilience
   through coping strategies for managing such within-group tensions. This
   analysis advances equity-oriented efforts beyond increasing Black
   women's representation and retention by challenging the
   racialized-gendered culture of mathematics. Implications for educational
   practice and research include ways to disrupt P-16 mathematics education
   as a white, patriarchal space and broaden within-group solidarity,
   including Sisterhood among Black women.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a design-based research study
   related to slope that took place in a high school algebra 1 classroom.
   In the study, students explored situations related to making
   predictions. As students engaged with these situations, they reinvented
   and made meaningful multiple subconstructs of slope. I present the
   findings in the form of a learning trajectory for slope, which describes
   how learning happened over time, the principles that guide the design of
   activities that support this learning, and the rationale for how the
   activities support learning.},

Title = {Surveying Middle-Grades Teachers' Reasoning About Fraction Arithmetic in
   Terms of Measured Quantities},

Abstract = {We report a novel survey that narrows the gap between information about
   teachers' knowledge of fraction arithmetic provided, on the one hand, by
   measures practical to administer at scale and, on the other, by close
   analysis of moment-to-moment cognition. In particular, the survey
   measured components that would support reasoning directly with measured
   quantities, not by executing computational algorithms, to solve
   problems. These components-each of which was grounded in past
   research-were attention to referent units, partitioning and iterating,
   appropriateness, and reversibility. A second part of the survey asked
   about teachers' professional preparation and history. We administered
   the survey to a national sample of in-service middle-grades mathematics
   teachers in the United States and received responses from 990 of those
   teachers. We analyzed responses to items in the first part of the survey
   using the log-linear diagnostic classification model to estimate each
   teacher's profile of strengths and weaknesses with respect to the four
   components of reasoning. We report on the diversity of profiles that we
   found and on relationships between those profiles and various aspects of
   teachers' professional preparation and history. Our results provide
   insight into teachers' knowledge resources for enacting standards-based
   instruction in fraction arithmetic and an example of new possibilities
   for mathematics education research afforded by recent advances in
   psychometric modeling.},

   educational technology may focus only on skills for low-income students
   and students of color, further limiting their opportunities to learn
   mathematical reasoning, and thus pose a challenge to realizing
   standards-based reforms. Although we share the concern about equity and
   about funds wasted by inappropriate purchases of technology before
   planning based on research and the wisdom of expert practice, including
   inadequate professional development, we believe that Kitchen and Berk's
   commentary contains several limitations that could be misconstrued and
   thus misdirect policy and practice.},

Title = {Characterizations of Social-Based and Self-Based Contexts Associated

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {This exploratory study focused on characterizing problem-solving
   situations associated with spontaneous metacognitive activity. The
   results came from connected case studies of a group of 3 purposefully
   selected 9th-grade students working collaboratively on a series of 5
   modeling problems. Students' descriptions of their own thinking during
   small-group mathematical modeling, elicited during video-stimulated
   interviews, were analyzed to identify and characterize social-based and
   self-based contexts associated with metacognitive activity coded as
   awareness, regulatory, and evaluative. Three characterizations of the
   social-based contexts and 3 different characterizations of the
   self-based contexts emerged. Among social-based contexts, those
   characterized as interpreting diverse perspectives were significantly
   more frequent than those characterized as seeking mathematical
   consensus. Also, those characterized as engaging in explanations were
   significantly more frequent that those characterized as seeking
   mathematical consensus. Among self-based contexts, those characterized
   as seeking personal satisfaction were significantly more frequent than
   those characterized as making experience-based quantitative judgments as
   well as those identified as using personal projections.},

Abstract = {Previous research gives evidence that Japanese mathematics teachers
   ``may have a more detailed and widely shared theory about how to teach
   effectively{''} when compared to their U.S. counterparts (Jacobs \&
   Morita, 2002). This study explores the conceptions and cultural scripts
   of a group of Japanese mathematics teachers by analyzing the
   conversations between cooperating teachers and student teachers. It
   describes 6 principles of high-quality instruction that arose in at
   least half the conversations we analyzed. Each of these principles is
   examined in detail. Finally, some advantages of having a strong, shared
   conception of high-quality instruction and focusing on widely applicable
   instructional principles are presented.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a schema-based
   instructional strategy that emphasizes prealgebraic conceptualization of
   multiplicative relations on solving arithmetic word problems with
   elementary Students with teaming disabilities or problems (LP).
   Participants were 4 fifth graders with LP in a Midwestern urban public
   elementary school. An adapted multiple-probe-across-participants design
   was employed to assess the functional relation between the schema-based
   instructional strategy instruction and students' performance while
   solving word problems. The results of the study demonstrated the
   effectiveness of the schema-based instructional strategy with elementary
   students with LP. Introducing symbolic representation and algebraic
   thinking in earlier grades may facilitate a smoother transition from
   elementary to higher level mathematics learning and improve middle and
   high school mathematics performance.},

Abstract = {Analyses of disparities in students' mathematics experiences and
   outcomes are an essential part of efforts to promote equity. Scholars
   concerned about equity should not write off such analyses as mere ``gap
   gazing.{''} Research on gaps between underserved groups and their more
   advantaged peers are important for shaping public opinion and informing
   education policy. Analyses of gaps also inform mathematics education
   research and practice, illuminating which groups and curricular areas
   are most in need of intervention and additional study. Instead of
   pulling back from gaps analyses, the mathematics education community
   should move toward more skilled and nuanced analyses and integrate
   research on instructional reforms with careful analyses of their impact
   on disparities in student outcomes broadly defined.},

Abstract = {Enacting the vision of NCTM's Principles and Standards for School
   Mathematics depends on effective teacher professional development. This
   7-year study of 48 projects in the National Science Foundation's Local
   Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement Initiative investigates the
   relationship between professional development and teachers' attitudes,
   preparedness, and classroom practices in mathematics. These programs
   included many features considered to characterize effective professional
   development: content focus, extensive and sustained duration, and
   connection to practice and to influences on teachers' practice. Results
   provide evidence of positive impact on teacher-reported attitudes
   toward, preparedness for, and practice of Standards-based teaching,
   despite the fact that many teachers did not participate in professional
   development to the extent intended. Teachers' perception of their
   principals' support for Standards-based mathematics instruction was also
   positively related to these outcomes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to sketch a hypothetical descriptive
   framework of statistical knowledge for teaching. Because statistics is a
   discipline in its own right rather than a branch of mathematics, the
   knowledge needed to teach statistics is likely to differ from the
   knowledge needed to teach mathematics. Doing statistics involves many
   primarily nonmathematical activities, such as building meaning for data
   by examining the context and choosing appropriate study designs to
   answer questions of interest. Although there are differences between
   mathematics and statistics, the two disciplines do share common ground
   in that statistics utilizes mathematics. This connection suggests that
   existing research on mathematical knowledge for teaching can help inform
   research on statistical knowledge for teaching. I propose the use of
   research from the Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) project to
   help shape the discussion. I conclude by identifying areas of needed
   research and suggesting directions for teacher education efforts in
   statistics.},

Abstract = {In the SimCalc project and in the Mathematics of Change group at TERC,
   we are investigating how students from elementary through high school
   learn about the mathematics of change in multiple mathematical
   environments. As part of this research, we studied 5th-grade students
   doing mathematics-of-change activities from the Investigations
   curriculum (Russell, Tierney, Mokros, \& Economopoulos, 1998) in
   multiple mathematical environments. This experience has led us to
   question the view that students connect experiences in different
   environments by recognizing a core mathematical structure that is
   corm-non to all environments. We propose an alternative perspective on
   learning, in which students make mathematical environments into lived-in
   spaces for themselves and connect environments through the development
   of family resemblances across their experiences.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {In this article talk is understood to be a resource for mathematical
   learning in school. As a resource it needs to be both seen (be visible)
   to be used and seen through (be invisible) to provide access to
   mathematical learning. Lave and Wenger's (1991) concept of transparency
   captures this dual function of talk as a learning resource in the
   practice of school mathematics. I argue that the dual functions,
   visibility and invisibility, of talk in mathematics classrooms create
   dilemmas for teachers. An analytic narrative vignette drawn from a
   secondary mathematics classroom in South Africa illustrates the dilemma
   of transparency that mathematics teachers can face, particularly if they
   are reaching multilingual classes.},

Abstract = {In order to develop students' capacities to `'do mathematics,''
   classrooms must become environments in which students are able to engage
   actively in rich, worthwhile mathematical activity. This paper focuses
   on examining and illustrating how classroom-based factors can shape
   students' engagement with mathematical tasks that were set up to
   encourage high-level mathematical thinking and reasoning. The findings
   suggest that when students' engagement is successfully maintained at a
   high level, a large number of support factors are present. A decline in
   the level of students' engagement happens in different ways and for a
   variety of reasons. Four qualitative portraits provide concrete
   illustrations of the ways in which students' engagement in high-level
   cognitive processes was found to continue or decline during classroom
   work on tasks.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {258-292},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The present study extends previous research in this area by providing a
   more elaborate and theoretical description of students' solution
   strategies and errors in dealing with 3-D cube arrays. It describes
   several cognitive constructions and operations that seem to be required
   for students to conceptualize and enumerate the cubes in such arrays,
   exploring in depth general cognitive operations such as coordination,
   integration, and `'structuring'' as they are manifested in a spatial
   context. It describes how, in dealing with 3-D rectangular arrays,
   students' spatial thinking is related to their enumeration strategies.
   The findings suggest that students' initial conception of a 3-D
   rectangular array of cubes is as an uncoordinated set of faces.
   Eventually, as students become capable of coordinating views, they see
   the array as space filling and strive to restructure it as such. Those
   who complete a global restructuring of the array use layering
   strategies. Those in transition use strategies that indicate that their
   restructuring is local rather than global. Finally, the data suggest
   that many students are unable to enumerate the cubes in a 3-D array
   because they cannot coordinate the separate views of the array and
   integrate them to construct one coherent mental model of the array.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to identify students' preconceptions
   concerning statistical association in contingency tables. An
   experimental study was carried out with 213 preuniversity students, and
   it was based on students' responses to a written questionnaire including
   2 x 2, 2 x 3, and 3 x 3 contingency tables. In this article, the
   students' judgments of association and solution strategies are compared
   with the findings of previous psychological research on 2 x 2
   contingency tables. We also present an original classification of
   students' strategies, from a mathematical point of view. Correspondence
   analysis is used to show the effect of item task variables on students'
   strategies. Finally, we include a qualitative analysis of the strategies
   of 51 students, which has served to characterize three misconceptions
   concerning statistical association.},

Abstract = {Constructivist theory has been prominent in recent research on
   mathematics learning and has provided a basis for recent mathematics
   education reform efforts. Although constructivism has the potential to
   inform changes in mathematics teaching, it offers no particular vision
   of how mathematics should be taught; models of teaching based on
   constructivism are needed. Data are presented from a whole-class,
   constructivist teaching experiment in which problems of teaching
   practice required the teacher/researcher to explore the pedagogical
   implications of his teaching (constructivist) perspectives. The analysis
   of the data red to the development of a model of teacher decision making
   with respect to mathematical tasks. Central to this model is the
   creative tension between the teacher's goals with regard to student
   learning and his responsibility to be sensitive and responsive to the
   mathematical thinking of the students.},

Abstract = {Subjects were asked to select from among four possible sequences the
   `'most likely'' to result from flipping a coin five times. Contrary to
   the results of Kahneman and Tversky (1972), the majority of subjects
   (72\%) correctly answered that the sequences are equally likely to
   occur. This result suggests, as does performance on similar NAEP items,
   that most secondary school and college-age students view successive
   outcomes of a random process as independent. However, in a follow-up
   question, subjects were also asked to select the `'least likely''
   result. Only half the subjects who had answered correctly responded
   again that the sequences were equally likely; the others selected one of
   the sequences as least likely. This result was replicated in a second
   study in which 20 subjects were interviewed as they solved the same
   problems. One account of these logically inconsistent responses is that
   subjects reason about the two questions from different perspectives.
   When asked to select the most likely outcome, some believe they are
   being asked to predict what actually will happen, and give the answer
   `'equally likely'' to indicate that all of the sequences are possible.
   This reasoning has been described by Konold (1989) as an `'outcome
   approach'' to uncertainty. This prediction scheme does not fit questions
   worded in terms of the least likely result, and thus some subjects
   select an incompatible answer based on `'representativeness'' (Kahneman
   \& Tversky, 1972). These results suggest that the percentage of
   secondary school students who understand the concept of independence is
   much lower than the latest NAEP results would lead us to believe and,
   more generally, point to the difficulty of assessing conceptual
   understanding with multiple-choice items.},

Abstract = {In this study, about 200 middle school students solved an
   augmented-quotient division-with-remainders problem, and their solution
   processes and interpretations were examined. Based on earlier research,
   semantic-processing models were proposed to explain students' success or
   failure in solving division-with-remainder story problems on the basis
   of the presence or absence of an adequate interpretation provided by the
   solver after obtaining a numerical solution. In this study, students'
   solutions and their attempts and failures to `'make sense'' of their
   answers were analyzed for evidence that supported or refuted the
   hypothesized semantic-processing models. The results confirmed that the
   models provide a solid explanation of students' failure to solve
   division-with-remainder problems in school settings. More generally, the
   results indicated that student performance was adversely affected by
   their dissociation of sense making from the solution of school
   mathematics problems and their difficulty in providing written accounts
   of their mathematical thinking and reasoning.},

Abstract = {Forty-four academic pure mathematicians were given Levine's (1982)
   computational estimation task, which involved estimating the answers to
   20 multiplication and division problems and describing the strategies
   used. The mathematicians were accurate estimators, and they used a great
   variety of strategies, as many as 23 for a single problem. All but 2 of
   the mathematicians used some strategy that was not used by the other 43
   for at least one problem. When 18 mathematicians were retested after an
   interval of several months, they used different strategies on the second
   test for 9 to 17 of the 20 problems. Some theoretical implications of
   these findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {We assessed the efficacy of two spatial learning programs grounded in
   early years learning pedagogical theory to improve numeracy performance
   in preschool. Engagement with a play-based spatial program led to better
   overall spatial reasoning and transferred to better numeracy compared
   with a business-as-usual control, underscoring the importance of
   embedding spatial learning within strong pedagogy and authentic
   preschool contexts. Engagement with the same spatial program using a
   spatialized curriculum (e.g., gesture, sketching) showed large additive
   effects, highlighting the role of spatial reasoning tools to support
   transfer of spatial reasoning to numeracy. The effects of the two
   interventions were moderated by spatial reasoning, with children with
   lower spatial reasoning making the most gains in numeracy.},

Abstract = {Precalculus and calculus are considered gatekeeper courses because of
   their academic challenge and status as requirements for STEM (science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics) and non-STEM majors alike.
   Despite college mathematics often being seen as a neutral space, the
   field has identified ways that expectations, interactions, and
   instruction are racialized and gendered. This article uses the concept
   of labor to examine responses from 20 students from historically
   marginali2ed groups to events identified as discouraging in precalculus
   and calculus instruction. Findings illustrate how Black students,
   Latina/o students, and white women engage in emotional and cognitive
   labor in response to discouraging events. Additionally, to manage this
   labor, students named coping strategies that involved moderating their
   participation to avoid or minimize the racialized and gendered impact of
   undergraduate mathematics instruction.},

Abstract = {Although considerable literature illustrates how students' experiences
   and identities are racialized in mathematics education, little attention
   has been given to Asian American students. Employing ethnographic
   methods, this study followed 10 immigrant Chinese-heritage families to
   explore how the racial narrative of the model minority myth was locally
   produced in mathematics education. We draw on constructs of racial
   narratives and cultural production to identify the local production of
   the narrative Asians are smart and good at math during K-12 schooling.
   Specifically, the Asian American students (re)produced racial narratives
   related to three cultural resources: (a) Their immigrant parents'
   narratives about the U.S. elementary school mathematics curriculum; (b)
   the school mathematics student tracking system; and (c) students'
   locally generated racial narratives about what being Asian means.},

Abstract = {Cooney, Shealy, and Arvold (1998) wrote a widely cited article
   describing the belief structures of prospective teachers and argued that
   the structures can aid in describing how beliefs change and the
   influence of authority on the individual. We investigate the impact of
   this manuscript on the field. To do this, we conducted a literature
   review (n = 59) of journal articles and proceedings published since 1998
   covering the same population and goals of Cooney, Shealy, and Arvold
   (changing prospective teachers' beliefs) and then conducted an analysis
   of 101 journal articles citing Cooney, Shealy, and Arvold (1998) to see
   why the authors cited the piece. We conclude that the impact of Cooney,
   Shealy, and Arvold's article differs from that of their results and
   suggest that belief structures should be more carefully investigated by
   the field.},

Abstract = {We report on a study in which we observed 73 mathematics majors
   completing 7 proof construction tasks in calculus. We use these data to
   explore the frequency and effectiveness with which mathematics majors
   use diagrams when constructing proofs. The key findings from this study
   are (a) nearly all participants introduced diagrams on multiple tasks,
   (b) few participants displayed either a strong propensity or a strong
   reluctance to use diagrams, and (c) little correlation existed between
   participants' propensity to use diagrams and their mathematical
   achievement (either on the proof construction tasks or in their advanced
   mathematics courses). At the end of the report, we discuss implications
   for pedagogy and future research.},

Abstract = {Our aim is to discuss how school mathematical activity is modified when
   students' everyday situations are brought into the classroom. One
   illustrative sequence-7th grade classes solving problems that required
   proportional reasoning is characterized as a system of interconnected
   activities within the theoretical perspective of activity theory. We
   discuss the tensions and contradictions that evolve when a generic
   school procedure emphasized by the teacher meets the specific procedures
   applicable to everyday situations proposed by the students. We evaluate
   the modifications that we perceived in the power relationships and other
   components of the school activity and the expansion of the meaning of
   those procedures as positive outcomes of how everyday situations were
   dealt with in school mathematics.},

Abstract = {This article introduces an interview-based instrument that was created
   for the purposes of characterizing the visions of high-quality
   mathematics instruction of teachers, principals, mathematics coaches,
   and district leaders and tracking changes in those visions over time.
   The instrument models trajectories of perceptions of high-quality
   instruction along what have been identified in the literature as
   critical dimensions of mathematics classroom practice. Included are a
   description of the methods by which an analysis of interview data was
   integrated with previous findings from the research literature in order
   to develop leveled rubrics for assessing visions of high-quality
   mathematics instruction, a report of the results of using the instrument
   to code more than 900 interviews, and a discussion of the possible
   applications and benefits of such a methodological approach.},

Abstract = {In this article we report 3 experiments demonstrating that a simple
   booklet containing self-explanation training, designed to focus
   students' attention on logical relationships within a mathematical
   proof, can significantly improve their proof comprehension. Experiment 1
   demonstrated that students who received the training generated higher
   quality explanations and performed better (effect size d=0.950) on a
   comprehension test. Experiment 2 demonstrated that self-explanation
   training increased students' cognitive engagement and the frequency with
   which they moved their attention around a proof. Experiment 3
   demonstrated that a 15-minute in-lecture self-study intervention
   improved students' proof comprehension and that the effect persisted
   overtime. Thus, we argue that transition to proof courses should
   incorporate self-explanation training.},

Abstract = {The primary goal of Project M-2 was to develop and field-test
   challenging geometry and measurement units for all K-2 students. This
   article reports on the achievement results for students in Grade 2 at 12
   urban and suburban sites in 4 states using the Iowa Tests of Basic
   Skills (ITBS) mathematics concepts subtest and an open-response
   assessment. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated no significant
   differences between the experimental (n=193) and comparison group
   (n=192) on the ITBS (84\% of items focused on number); thus, mathematics
   concepts were not negatively impacted by this 12-week study of geometry
   and measurement. Statistically significant differences (p<.001) with a
   large effect size (d=0.89) favored the experimental group on the
   open-response assessment. Thus, the experimental group exhibited a
   deeper understanding of geometry and measurement concepts as measured by
   the open-response assessment while still performing as well on a
   traditional measure covering all mathematics content.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article shows how equity research in mathematics education can be
   decentered by reporting the ``voices{''} of mathematically successful
   African American male students as they recount their experiences with
   school mathematics, illustrating, in essence, how they negotiated the
   White male math myth. Using poststructural theory, the concepts
   discourse, person/identity, and power/agency are redefined or
   reinscribed. The article also shows that using a poststructural
   reinscription of these concepts, a more complex analysis of the
   multiplicitous and fragmented robust mathematics identities of African
   American male students is possible-an analysis that refutes simple
   explanations of effort. The article concludes, not with ``answers,{''}
   but with questions to facilitate dialogue among those who are interested
   in the mathematics achievement and persistence of African American male
   students-and equity and justice in the mathematics classroom for all
   students.},

   important for informing teacher preparation and professional development
   efforts. Based on prior research, analysis of video, interviews with
   teachers, and analysis of textbooks, we define categories of knowledge
   and practices of teaching for understanding and assessing teachers'
   knowledge for teaching algebra. The three categories of knowledge
   school, advanced, and teaching build on the work of Ball and others for
   elementary school teaching and take into account the recommendations of
   the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (2001, 2012) for
   secondary school teachers' knowledge of post-secondary mathematics.
   Three categories of teaching practices trimming, bridging, and
   decompressing address mathematical uses of knowledge specific to
   teaching. We argue that the combination of categories and practices must
   be covered in assessments of teacher knowledge, if the assessments are
   to be used in research that investigates the presumed links among
   teachers' content preparation, their knowledge, their practice, and
   student learning.},

Abstract = {This Research Commentary addresses the need for standards for describing
   mathematics professional development in mathematics education research
   reports. Considering that mathematics professional development is an
   emerging research field, it is timely to set expectations for what
   constitutes high-quality reporting in this field. Through an examination
   of the research reports on the topic published in the Journal for
   Research in Mathematics Education during the past decade, I offer a
   framework and a set of features to be used in initiating discussions
   about pros and cons of having reporting standards. I contend that when
   researchers have standards for describing the mathematics professional
   development they are studying, better quality will be attained in the
   new research field.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-17},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sets of mathematics problems are generally arranged in I of 2 ways. With
   blocked practice, all problems are drawn from the preceding lesson. With
   mixed review, students encounter a mixture of problems drawn from
   different lessons. Mixed review has 2 features that distinguish it from
   blocked practice: Practice problems on the same topic are distributed,
   or spaced, across many practice sets; and problems on different topics
   are intermixed within each practice set. A review of the relevant
   experimental data finds that each feature typically boosts subsequent
   performance, often by large amounts, although for different reasons.
   Spacing provides review that improves long-term retention, and mixing
   improves students' ability to pair a problem with the appropriate
   concept or procedure. Hence, although mixed review is more demanding
   than blocked practice, because students cannot assume that every problem
   is based on the immediately preceding lesson, the apparent benefits of
   mixed review suggest that this easily adopted strategy is underused.},

Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {220-246},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The goal of this article is to examine students' mathematical
   development that occurs as a teacher works within each of 2 zones of
   learning: students' zones of proximal development (ZPD) and students'
   zones of potential construction (ZPC). ZPD, proposed by Vygotsky, is
   grounded in a social constructivist perspective on learning, whereas
   ZPC, proposed by Steffe, is grounded in a radical constructivist
   perspective on learning. In this article, we consider potential
   pragmatic differences between ZPD and ZPC as instantiated during a
   semester-long teaching experiment with 2 Grade 6 students. In
   particular, we examine the constructions that a teacher fostered by
   working with these students in each zone of learning. The data suggest
   that operating in their ZPD but outside of their ZPC impacts the
   learning opportunities and resulting constructions of the students.
   Finally, we characterize aspects of ZPD and teacher assistance that
   foster the development of mathematical concepts.},

Abstract = {This article describes a subset of results from a larger study (Rubel,
   2002) that explored middle school and high school students'
   probabilistic reasoning abilities across a variety of probabilistic
   contexts and constructs, Students in grades 5, 7, 9, and I I at an
   urban, private school for boys (n = 173) completed a Probability
   Inventory, comprising adapted tasks from the research literature, which
   required students to provide answers as well as justifications of their
   responses. Supplemental clinical interviews were conducted with 33
   students to provide further detail about their reasoning. This article
   focuses specifically on the probabilistic constructs of compound events
   and independence in the context of coin tossing. Analyses of
   justifications of correct and incorrect answers are provided, offering
   insight into students' strategies, reasoning, and underlying cognitive
   models. A belief framework is supported by the results of this study.
   Potential implications for research and instruction are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB, 2002) elevates the
   importance of educational research and thereby provides opportunities
   for mathematics education researchers in its support for and funding of
   rigorous research studies and its requirement of effective,
   research-based practices. At the same time, by demanding more of
   overburdened teachers and administrators, NCLB may exacerbate a
   long-standing gulf between educational research and practice. We use our
   recent experiences with conducting school-based research to illustrate
   how educational research can be impeded by the added demands of NCLB and
   other factors in the current climate. In addition, we hope to begin a
   dialogue that will encourage researchers and practitioners to work
   together to capitalize on NCLB's increased emphasis on educational
   research to create a systematic approach to bridging the
   research-practice gulf.},

Abstract = {Flexible use of multiple representations has been described as it key
   component of competent mathematical thinking and problem solving. In
   this study, 6th-grade American students are compared to 3 samples of
   Asian (Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese) 6th graders to determine if the
   well-documented mathematical achievement of students from these Asian
   nations may be due in part to a greater understanding of mathematical
   representations. The results show that, among all groups, Chinese
   students generally scored highest on the representation tasks and,
   except on items about the visual representations of fractions, all Asian
   samples scored significantly higher than the American sample. The
   results are discussed in terms of possible instructional antecedents and
   textbook differences.},

Abstract = {In this article we articulate a methodology for studying mathematics
   teacher development in the context of reform. The generation of accounts
   of teachers' practice, an adaptation of the case study, provides an
   approach to understanding teachers' current practice and to viewing
   their current practice in the context of development toward envisioned
   reforms. The methodology is an alternative both to studies that focus on
   teachers' deficits and to teachers' own accounts of their practice.
   Conceptual frameworks developed within the mathematics education
   research community are applied to the task of investigating the nature
   of practice developed by teachers in transition. We characterize this
   methodology as explicating the teacher's perspective from the
   researchers' perspectives.},

Abstract = {in this article we present and describe a pedagogical Framework that
   supports children's development: of conceptual understanding of
   mathematics. The framework fed Advancing Children's Thinking (ACT) was
   synthesized from an in-depth analysis of observed and reported data from
   I skillful Ist-grade teacher using the Everyday Mathematics (EM)
   curriculum. The ACT framework comprises 3 components: Eliciting
   Children's Solution Methods, Supporting Children's Conceptual
   Understanding, and Extending Children's Mathematical Thinking. The
   framework guided a cross-teacher analysis over 5 additional EM Ist-grade
   teachers. This comparison indicated that teachers often supported
   children's mathematical thing but less often elicited or extended
   children's thinking. The ACT framework can contribute to educational
   research, teacher education, and the design of mathematics curricula.},

Abstract = {This study explored the strategies used by 13 prospective secondary
   school mathematics teachers to develop and validate functions as
   mathematical models of real-world situations. The students, enrolled in
   an elective mathematics course, had continuous access to curve fitters,
   graphing utilities, and other computing tools. The modeling approaches
   fell under 4 general categories of technology use, distinguished by the
   extent and nature of curve-filter use and the relative dominance of
   mathematics versus reality affecting the development and evaluation of
   models. Data suggested that strategy choice was influenced by task
   characteristics and interactions with other student modelers. A grounded
   hypothesis on strategy selection and use was formulated.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {8-25},

Abstract = {Thirty-six first graders from 2 different school systems participated in
   individual interviews to determine the children's slated perceptions
   regarding what it means to engage in mathematics and the rationale and
   conditions under which they held such perceptions. These children were
   in classrooms that reflected the spirit of the current reform movement
   in mathematics education. Generally, the children perceived of
   mathematics as a problem-solving endeavor in which many different
   strategies are considered viable and communicating mathematical thinking
   is an integral part of the task. The children recognized and accepted a
   variety of solution strategies, with many of the children valuing all
   solutions equally and assuming a shared responsibility with the teacher
   for their mathematics learning. Children had varying perceptions of what
   it meant to succeed in mathematics, but success was not determined by
   speed and accuracy. As we begin to understand children's perceptions of
   mathematics as they participate in reform-minded mathematics classrooms,
   we become aware of issues concerning the impact of the children's
   perceptions on both the development of their future perceptions and
   their mathematics learning.},

Abstract = {We present data from a two-year teaching experiment involving 8- and
   9-year-old children. The purpose of the teaching experiment was to
   investigate children's fraction learning and the role their whole-number
   knowledge might play in it. A major source for the children's
   experiences and experiments was an operator-like computer program called
   Copycat. In particular, we focus on the accomplishments of Elliot and
   Shannon as they solved fraction comparison problems. We identify and
   discuss three cognitive schemes that Elliot and Shannon used. These were
   an Equal Outputs scheme, limited in effectiveness to unit fraction
   comparisons; an Equal Inputs scheme that activated strategies for
   determining a common multiple; and a Scaling scheme in which fractions
   were scaled up or down using ratios. The major focus of the discussion
   is the role whole-number knowledge played in the application of these
   schemes. This study demonstrates an interdependence between development
   of rational-number knowledge and whole-number knowledge. Rational-number
   tasks in operator settings can help stimulate and extend children's
   whole-number knowledge. Facility with whole-number relationships enables
   students to solve fraction comparison problems.},

Abstract = {This study examined the validity of the Eccles et al. (1983) theoretical
   model of achievement behaviors using data from the Second International
   Mathematics Study.  With the achievement behavior defined as performance
   (mathematics achievement), the dominant effects of the value of
   mathematics and expectations for success that are hypothesized by the
   model were not apparent, and effects differed for males and females. 
   There were more direct and indirect influences on achievement from the
   psychological constructs for females, suggesting that the explanation of
   mathematics achievement within the context of this model was more
   complicated for females than for males.},

Abstract = {Twenty fourth-grade children were matched according to performance on a
   whole-number calculation and concepts pretest and assigned at random to
   one of two groups:  wooden base-ten blocks and computerized microworld. 
   Instruction in each group was designed to orient students toward
   relationships between notation and meaning.  Instruction given the two
   groups was based upon a single script that extended whole number
   numeration to decimal numeration, and emphasized solving problems in
   concrete settings while inventing notational schemes to represent steps
   in solutions.  Neither group changed in regard to whole-number
   notational methods.  Blocks children understood decimal numerals as if
   they were funny whole numbers; Microworld children attempted to give
   meaning to decimal notational methods, but were largely in a state of
   disequilibrium at the end of the study.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use a two-dimensional assessment to examine the
   experimental impacts of a mathematics learning trajectory-oriented
   formative assessment program on student strategies for problems
   involving multiplication and division. Working from the theory that the
   development of students' multiplicative reasoning involves improvements
   in both problem-solving accuracy and sophistication of strategies used
   to solve problems, we designed an assessment instrument to measure both
   dimensions of student learning. The instrument was used to measure the
   impact of the Ongoing Assessment Project (OGAP), which develops
   teachers' capacity to regularly assess student thinking in relation to a
   learning progression to develop instructional responses that are based
   on evidence of student thinking. The results showed significant impacts
   of OGAP on both students' problem-solving accuracy and the
   sophistication of their strategy. The findings suggest that capturing
   both dimensions of students' multiplicative reasoning offers important
   information for researchers and program designers who seek to understand
   different dimensions of student mathematics performance.},

Abstract = {This Brief Report addresses the fundamental role that sign language
   plays in the mathematics classroom of deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH)
   students. Selected findings are gathered from an ongoing study of signs
   and gestures used by DHH students and their teachers when encountering
   and communicating mathematical ideas at a German special-needs school
   that focuses on hearing and communication. The focus rests primarily on
   iconic aspects of mathematical ideas as reflected in the
   gestural-somatic modality of sign language. A categorization of
   iconicity in mathematical signs as used by the students is presented and
   used to reconstruct a case of meaning making in a Grade 5 geometry
   classroom. Insights gained from these observations lead beyond the DHH
   mathematics classroom by providing new perspectives on the interplay
   between language and communication, individual experience, and shared
   conceptualization.},

Abstract = {Identity is an important tool for understanding students' participation
   in mathematics lessons. Researchers usually examine identity at a
   macro-scale: across typical classroom activity and in students'
   self-reports. However, learning occurs on a micro-scale: in moments
   during a lesson. To capture identity in these moments, I used
   positioning theory to develop a framework of micro-identity and then to
   examine the identities and learning of 1 fourth-grade student during 1
   mathematics lesson. This study demonstrates how mathematical identities
   can shift in dramatic ways in response to minor changes in context so
   that a student might be, in one moment, engaged in an identity that
   undermines learning and then later engaged in an academically productive
   identity. These shifting micro-identities have important implications
   for mathematical learning, classroom contexts, and macro-identities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {296-315},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Based on Piaget's theory of logico-mathematical knowledge, 126 students
   in grades 2-5 were asked 6 questions about elapsed time. The main reason
   found for difficulty with elapsed time is children's inability to
   coordinate hierarchical units (hours and minutes). For example, many
   students answered that the duration between 8:30 and 11:00 was 3 hours
   30 minutes (because from 8:00 to 11:00 is 3 hours, and 30 more minutes
   is 3 hours 30 minutes). Coordination was found to begin among
   logico-mathematically advanced students, through reflective
   (constructive) abstraction from within. The educational implications
   drawn are that students must be encouraged to think about durations in
   daily living and to do their own thinking rather than being taught
   procedures for producing correct answers to elapsed-time questions.},

Abstract = {The effect of a 15- to 24-month in-service professional development (PD)
   program on state accountability mathematics test scores for middle
   school students was examined using a quasi-experimental design. Middle
   level mathematics teachers (n=128) from 7 school districts and 64 middle
   schools volunteered for a PD sequence of content-oriented summer courses
   and pedagogy-oriented structured follow-up experiences during the
   subsequent academic year. Student effects of the PD program were
   measured using Colorado's state mathematics test results for 2 cohorts
   of students: 1 that received mathematics instruction from participant
   teachers in the year prior to the PD and another cohort that received
   mathematics instruction in the year following the PD. The odds of a
   student achieving a Proficient or Advanced score on the state test were
   then compared between cohorts. Results showed that students' odds of
   achieving a score of Proficient or better increased with teacher
   participation in the PD program.},

   7th-grade students engaged in when they used fractions in the context of
   area and perimeter, decimal operations, similarity, and ratios and
   proportions. The study's results revealed that students did not simply
   take the concepts and skills learned in formal fractions units and use
   them in these other mathematical content areas. Their understanding of
   how to use fractions was tied to their understanding of situations in
   which they could be used. Students had to take into account both
   mathematical and situational contexts when making choices about how to
   use fractions. This led students to raise questions regarding what was
   appropriate when using fractions in these new contexts and how fractions
   and the new contexts were related.},

Abstract = {We address the telling/not-telling dilemma in mathematics education.
   Telling is instructionally important, but has been downplayed because of
   (a) perceived inconsistencies between telling and constructivism, (b)
   increased awareness of the negative consequences of relying too heavily
   on telling, and (c) a focus on ``non-telling{''} actions as pedagogical
   implications of constructivism. In response, we advance a theoretical
   reformulation of telling as the set of teaching actions that serve the
   function of stimulating students' mathematical thoughts via the
   introduction of new ideas into a classroom conversation. We reformulate
   telling in three ways: (a) in terms of the function (which involves
   attention to the teacher's intention, the nature of the teaching action,
   and the students' interpretations of the action) rather than the form of
   teachers' communicative acts; (b) in terms of the conceptual rather than
   procedural content of the new information; and (c) in terms of its
   relationship to other actions rather than as an isolated action. This
   reformulation resolves some of the concerns with teaching as telling and
   helps establish the legitimacy of providing new information within a
   constructivist perspective on learning.},

Abstract = {In this study we investigated above-average high school calculus
   students from Japan and the United States in order to determine any
   differences in their conceptual understanding of calculus and their
   ability to use algebra to solve traditional calculus problems. We
   examined and interviewed 18 Calculus BC students in the United States
   and 26 Suugaku 3 (calculus) students in Japan. Each student completed
   two parts of a written examination. The first part (Part I) consisted of
   problems emphasizing conceptual understanding but requiring little or no
   algebraic computation. Problems on the second part (Part II) required
   sound algebraic skills in addition to good conceptual understanding.
   Following the examination, we interviewed each student in order to
   assess their mathematical and educational background, their college and
   career plans, their thinking on the examination problems, their
   understanding of concepts, and their computational and reasoning skills.
   We found little difference in the conceptual understanding of calculus
   between the two groups of students, but the Japanese students
   demonstrated much stronger algebra skills than their American
   counterparts.},

Title = {The impact of two standards-based mathematics curricula on student

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Since the passage of the Education Reform Act in 1993, Massachusetts,
   has developed curriculum frameworks and a new statewide testing system.
   As school districts align curriculum and teaching practices with the
   frameworks, standards-based mathematics programs are beginning to
   replace more traditional curricula. This paper presents a
   quasi-experimental study using matched comparison groups to investigate
   the impact of one elementary and one middle school standards-based
   mathematics program in Massachusetts on student achievement. The study
   compares statewide standardized test scores of fourth-grade students
   using Everyday Mathematics and eighth-grade students using Connected
   Mathematics to test scores of demographically similar students using a
   mix of traditional curricula. Results indicate that students in schools
   using either of these standards-based programs as their primary
   mathematics curriculum performed significantly better on the 1999
   statewide mathematics test than did students in traditional programs
   attending matched comparison schools. With minor exceptions, differences
   in favor of the standards-based program, remained consistent across
   mathematical strands, question types, and student sub-populations.},

Abstract = {In this study, we extended O'Callaghan's computer-intensive algebra
   study by using his component competencies and the process-object
   framework to investigate the effects of a graphing-approach curriculum
   employing the TI-82 graphing calculator. We found that students in the
   graphing-approach classes demonstrated significantly better
   understanding of functions on all 4 subcomponents of O'Callaghan's
   Function Test, including the reification component, than did students in
   the traditional-approach classes. Additionally, no significant
   differences were found between the graphing-approach and traditional
   classes either on a final examination of traditional algebra skills or
   on an assessment of mathematics attitude.},

Abstract = {This article discusses effects on different types of students'
   interactions while learning mathematics in a particular cooperative
   small-group setting. Three low-level ninth-grade classes engaged in
   learning mathematics in an experimental cooperative method. Data were
   collected through classroom observations, students' written
   self-reports, and an attitude questionnaire. A group of four students
   from one of the classes was observed more closely. Analysis of classroom
   observations and students' self-reports focused on students' activeness,
   interactions, and attitudes toward the experimental method. Findings for
   the cooperative small-group setting indicated (a) an increase in
   students' activeness, (b) a shift toward students' on-task verbal
   interactions, (c) various opportunities for students to receive help,
   and (d) positive attitudes toward the cooperative experimental method. A
   fourth class served as a control group to ascertain whether student
   achievement increased or decreased as a result of the experimental
   method.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to the ongoing discussion of visualization and
   analysis in mathematical thinking. On the basis of data gathered from
   clinical interviews with 32 students in their first abstract algebra
   course, we consider the tasks of listing the elements of the dihedral
   group D-4 and finding the product of two such elements. These problems
   can be solved either using a `'visual'' approach of transforming a
   square or an `'analytic'' approach of multiplying permutations. Rather
   than clearly preferring either a visual or analytic strategy, most
   students in our study used some combination of these approaches. Our
   results suggest that the conventional analyzer/visualizer dichotomy may
   not be an appropriate classification scheme for describing learning
   processes or for designing instruction. We propose an alternative model,
   the Visualizer/Analyzer or VA model, that assumes visualization and
   analysis to be mutually dependent in mathematical problem solving,
   rather than unrelated opposites. Our model provides one description of
   how this mutual dependence might function. We end by considering how
   pedagogical approaches might be designed in consonance with this model
   to help students coordinate visual and analytic thinking.},

Abstract = {Dutch mathematics programs emphasize mental addition and subtraction in
   the lower grades. For two-digit numbers up to 100, instruction focuses
   on `'counting by tens from any number'' (N10), a strategy that is
   difficult to learn. Therefore, many children prefer as an easier
   alternative `'decomposition'' in tens (1010) and units. Instead of the
   use of arithmetic blocks (BL), the hundredsquare (HU) was introduced in
   the 1980s because of a (supposed) better modeling function for teaching
   N10. In a field study with several schools, (a) we compared the
   strategies N10 and 1010 on procedural effectiveness and error types, and
   (b) we assessed the influence of the support conditions BL versus HU on
   the acquisition of mental strategies (we had also a control condition NO
   with no extra materials or models). Results confirmed the greater
   effectiveness of N10 but also the preference of many weaker children for
   1010. Support for BL or HU had differential effects on mental
   strategies. Differences are discussed in terms of cognitive psychology:
   the role of declarative knowledge and the relation between conceptual
   and procedural knowledge. New Dutch proposals for the 1990s emphasize
   teaching both strategies N10 and 1010 to enhance the flexibility of
   students' mental arithmetic.},

Abstract = {Results in 487 reports were integrated by meta-analysis to study four
   regions of problem solving: characteristics of problem solvers,
   conditions for harder and easier problems, effects of different
   instructional methods on problem-solving performance, and effects of
   classroom-related conditions on problem-solving performance. Direct
   significant links were found between problem solving and various
   measures of basic performance, especially skills in basic mathematics. 
   Weaker correlations appeared between problem solving and IQ measures. A
   format consisting of full problem statements supported by diagrams,
   figures, or sketches directly related to better performance; training
   for skill in such representations provided the largest performance
   improvement. During the early grades K-5, no method of problem-solving
   instruction emerged as superior. Heuristics in middle grades 6-8 seemed
   mildly better than other approaches and gained a distinctly superior
   status in high school. A positive impact on students' performance also
   resulted from teachers especially trained in heuristical methods.},

   in specializing in a specific area within mathematics education. In
   addition, people considering postdoctoral appointments often choose
   institutions that have niches or specializations aligned with their

   of the foci of specific faculty members who are active in research and
   scholarship and have gained broad recognition for their work. This brief

Abstract = {We present findings from a recently completed census survey of all
   mathematics departments in the United States that offer a graduate
   degree in mathematics. The census survey is part of a larger project
   investigating institutional features that influence student success in
   the introductory mathematics courses that are required of most STEM
   majors in the United States. We report the viewpoints of departments
   about characteristics shown to support students' success as well as the
   extent to which these characteristics are being implemented in programs
   across the country. We conclude with a discussion of areas where we see
   the potential for growth and further improvement.},

Abstract = {In support of efforts to foreground functions as central objects of
   study in algebra, this study provides evidence of how secondary students
   use trigonometric functions in contextual tasks. I examined secondary
   students' work on a problem involving modeling the periodic motion of a
   Ferris wheel through the use of a visual programming environment. Using
   the cK cent model of conceptions, I characterized 5 conceptions of sine
   and cosine functions in students' work that differed in the ways that
   students interpreted the given problem, their use of semiotic resources,
   and the control structures that motivated their work. This study
   illustrates the range of prior knowledge and resources that students may
   draw on in their use of trigonometric functions as well as how the goals
   of students' work inform their reasoning about trigonometric functions.},

Abstract = {The construction of positive mathematical identities (MIs) is a complex
   and central issue in school mathematics, where girls are usually
   ``counted out{''} of the field. This study explores positive MIs (high
   achiever and positive relationship with mathematics) of 3 girls. We
   employed a nested model of identity based on a case study approach
   (i.e., female mathematics students nested within a cluster of students
   nested within a mathematics classroom). The results highlight diversity
   in how these girls experienced mathematics: They valued different forms
   of doing mathematics (independent and collaborative; wider and complex;
   and straightforward, procedure-oriented mathematics), showed different
   forms of engagement (detachment, protagonist and challenging, and
   compliant and support-seeker), and narrated different MIs (efficient,
   different, and responsible). The study also explores and discusses the
   roles of mathematical practice and belonging to different peer clusters
   in these different forms of identification.},

   Education Communities of Practice},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Statistics education has begun to mature as a discipline distinct from
   mathematics education, creating new perspectives on the teaching and
   learning of statistics. This commentary emphasizes the importance of
   coordinating perspectives from statistics education and mathematics
   education through boundary interactions between the two communities of
   practice. I argue that such interactions are particularly vital in
   shared problem spaces related to the teaching and learning of
   measurement, variability, and contextualized problems. Collaborative
   work within these shared problem spaces can contribute to the vitality
   of each discipline. Neglect of the shared problem spaces may contribute
   to insularity and have negative consequences for research and school
   curricula. Challenges of working at the boundaries are considered, and
   strategies for overcoming the challenges are proposed.},

Abstract = {Slow faculty uptake of research-based, student-centered teaching and
   learning approaches limits the advancement of U.S. undergraduate
   mathematics education. A study of inquiry-based learning (IBL) as
   implemented in over 100 course sections at 4 universities provides an
   example of such multicourse, multi-institution uptake. Despite variation
   in how IBL was implemented, student outcomes are improved in IBL courses
   relative to traditionally taught courses, as assessed by general
   measures that apply across course types. Particularly striking, the use
   of IBL eliminates a sizable gender gap that disfavors women students in
   lecture-based courses. The study suggests the real-world promise of
   broad uptake of student-centered teaching methods that improve learning
   outcomes and, ultimately, student retention in college mathematics.},

Abstract = {This study examined the relationship between high school mathematics
   curricula and student achievement and course-taking patterns over 4
   years of college course taking for a sample of over 10,000 students from
   32 postsecondary 4-year institutions. Three types of curricula were
   studied: National Science Foundation (NSF) funded curricula, the
   University of Chicago School Mathematics Project curriculum, and
   commercially developed curricula. The major result was that high school
   mathematics curricula were unrelated to college mathematics achievement
   or students' course-taking patterns for students who began college with
   precalculus (college algebra) or a more difficult course. However,
   students of the NSF-funded curricula were statistically more likely to
   begin their college mathematics at the developmental level. Implications
   of these results for research and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study employed a cluster randomized trial design to evaluate the
   effectiveness of a research-based intervention for improving the
   mathematics education of very young children. This intervention includes
   the Building Blocks mathematics curriculum, which is structured in
   research-based learning trajectories, and congruous professional
   development emphasizing teaching for understanding via learning
   trajectories and technology. A total of 42 schools serving low-resource
   communities were randomly selected and randomly assigned to 3 treatment
   groups using a randomized block design involving 1,375 preschoolers in
   106 classrooms. Teachers implemented the intervention with adequate
   fidelity. Pre- to posttest scores revealed that the children in the
   Building Blocks group learned more mathematics than the children in the
   control group (effect size, g = 0.72). Specific components of a measure
   of the quantity and quality of classroom mathematics environments and
   teaching partially mediated the treatment effect.},

Abstract = {Discussions about school mathematics often address the importance of
   reasoning and proving for building students' understanding of
   mathematics. However, there is little research examining how teachers
   enact tasks designed to engage students in justifying and proving in the
   classroom. This article presents results of a study investigating the
   processes and outcomes of implementing proof-related tasks in the
   classroom. Data collection consisted of observations of 7 middle school
   classrooms during implementation of proof-related tasks tasks providing
   opportunities for students to produce generalizations, conjectures, or
   proofs in the Connected Mathematics Project (CMP) curriculum by teachers
   experienced in using the materials. The findings suggest that students'
   experiences with such tasks are insufficient for developing an
   understanding of what constitutes valid mathematical justification.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to investigate the mathematical practice
   of proof validation-that is, the act of determining whether an argument
   constitutes a valid proof The results of a study with 8 mathematicians
   are reported. The mathematicians were observed as they read purported
   mathematical proofs and made judgments about their validity; they were
   then asked reflective interview questions about their validation
   processes and their views on proving. The results suggest that
   mathematicians use several different modes of reasoning in proof
   validation, including formal reasoning and the construction of rigorous
   proofs, informal deductive reasoning, and example based reasoning.
   Conceptual knowledge plays an important role in the validation of
   proofs. The practice of validating a proof depends upon whether a
   student or mathematician wrote the proof and in what mathematical domain
   the proof was situated. Pedagogical and epistemological consequences of
   these results are discussed.},

Abstract = {California is one of 4 states that have accelerated addition and
   subtraction basic-facts memorization. This article reports on teacher
   practices, first-grade achievement of the standard, and a broader
   conception of basic-facts competence. Even among students from the
   highest performing schools, fewer than 11\% made progress toward the
   memorization standard equivalent to their progress through the school
   year. Several negative correlations between instructional strategies and
   student retrieval suggest that teachers may benefit from professional
   development targeted at basic-facts teaching and learning. Textbook
   reliance was negatively correlated with basic-facts retrieval,
   suggesting that educators and policymakers may want to reexamine
   assumptions about the efficacy of traditional first-grade textbooks.
   This study's findings may prove useful to teachers, professional
   development trainers, and textbook publishers as they consider ways to
   improve basic-facts learning among early elementary children.},

Abstract = {Using data from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY), we
   examined the extent to which students' mathematics coursework regulates
   (influences) the rate of growth in mathematics achievement during middle
   and high school. Graphical analysis showed that students who started
   middle school with higher achievement took mathematics courses earlier
   than those with lower achievement. Immediate improvement in mathematics
   achievement was observed right after taking particular mathematics
   courses (regular mathematics, prealgebra, algebra 1, trigonometry, and
   calculus). Statistical analysis showed that all mathematics courses
   added significantly to growth in mathematics achievement, although this
   added growth varied significantly across students. Regular mathematics
   courses demonstrated the least regulating power, whereas advanced
   mathematics courses (trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus)
   demonstrated the greatest regulating power. Regular mathematics,
   prealgebra, algebra 1, geometry, and trigonometry were important to
   growth in mathematics achievement even after adjusting for more advanced
   courses taken later in the sequence of students' mathematics coursework.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {38},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many researchers and curriculum frameworks recommend that the concept of
   proof and the corresponding activity of proving become part of students'
   mathematical experiences throughout the grades. Yet it is still unclear
   what `' proof `' means in school mathematics, especially in the
   elementary grades, and what role teachers have in cultivating proof and
   proving among their students. In this article, I propose a
   conceptualization of the meaning of proof in school mathematics and use
   classroom episodes from third grade to elaborate elements of this
   conceptualization and to illustrate its applicability even in the early
   elementary grades. Furthermore, I use the conceptualization to develop a
   tool to analyze the classroom episodes and to examine aspects of the
   teachers' role in managing their students' proving activity. This
   analysis supports the development of a framework about instructional
   practices for cultivating proof and proving in school mathematics.},

Abstract = {Given its important role in mathematics as well as its role as a
   gatekeeper to future educational and employment opportunities, algebra
   has become a focal point of both reform and research efforts in
   mathematics education. Understanding and using algebra is dependent on
   understanding a number of fundamental concepts, one of which is the
   concept of equality. This article focuses on middle school students'
   understanding of the equal sign and its relation to performance solving
   algebraic equations. The data indicate that many students lack a
   sophisticated understanding of the equal sign and that their
   understanding of the equal sign is associated with performance on
   equation-solving items. Moreover, the latter finding holds even when
   controlling for mathematics ability (as measured by standardized
   achievement test scores). Implications for instruction and curricular
   design are discussed.},

   sociocultural phenomenon or as a nurturing of the individual's
   mathematical development. However, instead of taking the dichotomous

Abstract = {Our concern in this study was to examine the relationship between
   problem-solving performance and the quality of the organization of
   students' knowledge. We report findings on the extent to which content
   and connectedness indicators differentiated between groups of
   high-achieving (HA) and low-achieving (LA) Year 10 students undertaking
   geometry tasks. The I-LA students' performance on the indicators of
   knowledge connectedness showed that, compared with the LA group, they
   could retrieve more knowledge spontaneously and could activate
   more:links among given knowledge schemas and related information.
   Connectedness indicators were more influential than content indicators
   in differentiating the groups on the basis of their success in problem
   solving, The tasks used in the study provide straightforward ways for
   teachers to gain information about the organizational quality of
   students' knowledge.},

Abstract = {A key element in developing ideas associated with statistical inference
   involves developing concepts of sampling. The objective of this research
   was to understand the characteristics of students' constructions of the
   concept of sample. Sixty-two students in Grades 3, 6, and 9 were
   interviewed using open-ended questions related to sampling; written
   responses to a questionnaire were also analyzed. Responses were
   characterized in relation to the content, structure, and objectives elf
   statistical literacy. Six categories of construction were identified and
   described in relation to the sophistication of developing concepts of
   sampling. These categories illustrate helpful and unhelpful foundations
   for an appropriate understanding of representativeness and hence will
   help curriculum developers and teachers plan interventions.},

   and after instruction in probability, which occurs for the Spanish
   students between the ages of 14 and 17. To achieve this aim, we gave 277
   secondary students a written questionnaire with some items taken from
   Green (1989, 1991). With our results we extend Green's previous research
   to 17-year-old students and complement his results with the analysis of
   students' arguments to support randomness in bidimensional
   distributions. Our results also indicate chat students' subjective
   understanding of randomness is close to some Interpretations of
   randomness throughout history.},

Abstract = {In contrast to contemporary estimation researchers who have focused
   primarily on children's computational estimation abilities, we examined
   the ideas surrounding the teaching and learning of measurement
   estimation in the classroom. Employing ethnomethodologically informed
   conversation analysis, we focused on 2 teachers' instructions during
   estimation lessons and on pupils' (aged 9-11 years) talk during
   small-group follow-up activities. The results indicated that estimation
   is understood as discursively interdependent with measurement and is
   associated both with teacher-formulated accountability and with
   vagueness, ambiguity, and guessing. Furthermore, the meaning of what it
   is to estimate is embedded in practical action. in concluding comments
   we consider the advantages of using conversational analysis as a method
   for highlighting the relationships between language and mathematics in
   the classroom.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on 3-year case studies of 2 schools with alternative
   mathematical teaching approaches. One school used a traditional,
   textbook approach; the other used open-ended activities at all times.
   Using various forms of case study data, including observations,
   questionnaires, interviews, and quantitative assessments, I will show
   the ways in which the 2 approaches encouraged different forms of
   knowledge. Students who followed a traditional approach developed a
   procedural knowledge that was of limited use to them in unfamiliar
   situations. Students who learned mathematics in an open, project-based
   environment developed a conceptual understanding that provided them with
   advantages in a range of assessments and situations. The project
   students had been ``apprenticed{''} into a system of thinking and using
   mathematics that helped them in both school and nonschool settings.},

Abstract = {A group of 21 middle-class parents and their 4-year-old children
   participated in this study of mathematics and parent-child interactions.
   Each family chose 4 separate 15-minute periods over 2 days to share
   multilink blocks, a child's book, blank paper, and preschool worksheets
   with their child at home. Each 15-minute session was audiotaped, all
   artifacts generated during the sessions were kept, and each parent was
   interviewed. The results of the study indicate that a wide range of
   mathematics was evident, with counting being the most prevalent
   activity. All parents succeeded in injecting some mathematics in most
   sessions; some did so by explicitly setting mathematics as a goal,
   whereas others injected the mathematics as a means of carrying out, or
   as an aside to, the play activity they coconstructed, Questioning
   children's knowledge was the main way parents elicited mathematics,
   although some requested explanations, or clarifications, and some
   mediated patterns, relationships, and strategies.},

Abstract = {The question of how to teach mathematics has become increasingly
   problematic in recent years as critics from diverse perspectives have
   offered wide-ranging, and often seemingly incommensurate, challenges to
   conventional conceptions of the teacher's task. This article represents
   an effort to `'bring into dialogue'' some of the varied commentaries on
   mathematics teaching, using an enactivist framework to interpret and to
   propose an alternative way of framing mathematics teaching. In this
   report, the manner in which the teacher listens is offered as a
   metaphoric lens through which to reinterpret practice, as a practical
   basis for teaching action, and as a means of addressing some of the
   critics' concerns. The report is developed around an extended
   collaborative research project with a middle school mathematics teacher.},

Abstract = {Personal construct psychology provides a coherent theoretical and
   methodological framework for the examination of teachers' knowledge. We
   report case studies of two teachers who varied in their knowledge about
   fractions and mathematical pedagogy. We used personal construct
   psychology and the logic of fuzzy sets to elucidate the content and
   organization of the teachers' knowledge of fractions. The approach
   proved especially useful for describing conditional relationships among
   content, general pedagogical, and pedagogical content knowledge frames.
   We also explored associations between teachers' personal constructions
   and their classroom teaching. These associations suggested that personal
   construct psychology shows considerable promise as a way of addressing

Abstract = {The multiplication principle (MP) is a fundamental aspect of
   combinatorial enumeration, serving as an effective tool for solving
   counting problems and underlying many key combinatorial formulas. In
   this study, we used guided reinvention to investigate 2 undergraduate
   students' reasoning about the MP, and we sought to answer the following
   research questions: How do students come to understand and make sense of
   the MP? Specifically, while a pair of students reinvented a statement of
   the MP, how did they attend to and reason about key mathematical
   features of the MP? The students participated in a paired 8-session
   teaching experiment during which they progressed from a nascent to a
   sophisticated statement of the MP. Two key mathematical features emerged
   for the students through this process, including independence and
   distinct composite outcomes, and we discuss ways in which these ideas
   informed the students' reinvention of the statement. In addition, we
   present potential implications and directions for future research.},

Abstract = {Mathematics education has benefited from qualitative methodological
   approaches over the past 40 years across diverse topics. Although the
   number, type, and quality of qualitative research studies in mathematics
   education has changed, little is known about how a collective body of
   qualitative research findings contributes to our understanding of a
   particular topic within the field. Through a process of qualitative
   research metasynthesis, our knowledge base can be broadened to provide
   insights into attitudes, perceptions, interactions, structures, and
   behaviors relevant for mathematics teaching and learning. The purpose of
   this commentary is to provide a rationale, definition, and procedure to
   conduct qualitative metasynthesis as a means of synthesizing and
   interpreting qualitative studies in the field of mathematics education.},

   methods used by researchers to compare and analyze the Common Core State
   Standards for Mathematics, each method designed for a particular
   purpose. Finally, we call upon mathematics education researchers to
   engage in careful analysis of curriculum standards and to share their
   findings in ways that can inform public debate as well as support

Abstract = {The release of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (National
   Governors Association Center for Best Practices \& Council of Chief
   State School Officers, 2010) and their adoption across the United States
   calls for careful attention to the alignment between mathematics
   standards and assessments. This study investigates 2 models that measure
   alignment between standards and assessments, the Surveys of Enacted
   Curriculum (SEC) and the Webb Alignment Tool (WAT), by examining the use
   of these models in 3 grade levels in 3 states. Findings indicate
   affordances and limitations of both models and suggest that, when taken
   together, the criteria of the WAT coupled with the alignment index and
   tile charts of the SEC provide a variety of perspectives on the
   alignment between standards and assessments. Findings from the study
   also suggest using caution when making decisions based on the results of
   alignment evaluations.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the equal sign as an indicator of mathematical equality is
   foundational to children's mathematical development and serves as a key
   link between arithmetic and algebra. This study extended prior efforts
   to use a construct modeling approach to unify diverse measures into a
   single assessment designed to measure knowledge of the equal sign.
   Children in Grades 2-6 (N = 224) completed the assessment. The current
   findings reaffirmed a past finding that diverse items can be integrated
   onto a single scale, revealed the wide variability in children's
   knowledge of the equal sign assessed by different types of items, and
   provided empirical evidence for a link between equal-sign knowledge and
   success on some basic algebra items.},

Abstract = {This revelatory case study examines a 5th-grade teacher's orchestration
   of discourse and interaction to create opportunities for English
   language learners to participate in the repair of mathematical errors
   during a unit on finding the area of geometric shapes. The analysis of
   discourse takes on a binocular perspective of considering gesture and
   speech as a unity (McNeil, 1992). The teacher's pointing,
   representational, and writing gestures were studied in relation to her
   questioning and revoicing. This research was guided by a social learning
   theory that characterizes learning as active and interactive
   participation in communities of practice (Lave \& Wenger, 1991; Wenger,
   1998). The findings detail how the teacher used gestures in grounding
   her questioning, revoicing students' strategies, and narrating the
   meaning of geometric features.},

Abstract = {This article explores elementary school teachers' mathematical knowledge
   for teaching and the relationship between such knowledge and teacher
   characteristics. The Learning Mathematics for Teaching project
   administered a multiple-choice assessment covering topics in number and
   operation to a nationally representative sample of teachers (n = 625)
   and at the same time collected information on teacher and student
   characteristics. Performance did not vary according to mathematical
   topic (e.g., whole numbers or rational numbers), and items categorized
   as requiring specialized knowledge of mathematics proved more difficult
   for this sample of teachers. There were few substantively significant
   relationships between mathematical knowledge for teaching and teacher
   characteristics, including leadership activities and self-reported
   college-level mathematics preparation. Implications for current policies
   aimed at improving teacher quality are addressed.},

Abstract = {Algebra instruction has traditionally been postponed until adolescence
   because of historical reasons (algebra emerged relatively recently),
   assumptions about psychological development ({''}developmental
   constraints{''} and ``developmental readiness{''}), and data documenting
   the difficulties that adolescents have with algebra. Here we provide
   evidence that young students, aged 9-10 years, can make use of algebraic
   ideas and representations typically absent from the early mathematics
   curriculum and thought to be beyond students' reach. The data come from
   a 30-month longitudinal classroom study of four classrooms in a public
   school in Massachusetts, with students between Grades 2-4. The data help
   clarify the conditions under which young students can integrate
   algebraic concepts and representations into their thinking. It is hoped
   that the present findings, along with those emerging from other research
   groups, will provide a research basis for integrating algebra into early
   mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Complexity science may be described as the science of learning systems,
   where learning is understood in terms of the adaptive behaviors of
   phenomena that arise in the interactions of multiple agents. Through two
   examples of complex learning systems, we explore some of the possible
   contributions of complexity science to discussions of the teaching of
   mathematics. We focus on two matters in particular: the use of the
   vocabulary of complexity in the redescription of mathematical
   communities and the application of principles of complexity to the
   teaching of mathematics. Through the course of this writing, we attempt
   to highlight compatible and complementary discussions that are already
   represented in the mathematics education literature.},

Abstract = {A total of n = 602 students (59.5\% female) from academically selected
   schools in Germany were tested at three time points-end of Grade 7, end
   of Grade 10, and middle of Grade 12-in order to investigate the
   relationships between academic interest and achievement in mathematics.
   In addition, sex differences in achievement, interest, and course
   selection were analyzed. At the end of Grade 10. students opted for
   either a basic or an advanced mathematics course. Data analyses revealed
   sex differences in favor of boys in mathematics achievement, interest,
   and opting for an advanced mathematics course. Further analyses by means
   of structural equation modeling show that interest had no significant
   effect on learning from Grade 7 to Grade 10, but did affect course
   selection-that is, highly interested students were more likely to choose
   an advanced course, Furthermore, interest at the end of Grade 10 had a
   direct and an indirect effect (via course selection) on achievement in
   upper secondary school. In addition, results suggest that, at least from
   Grade 7 to Grade 10, achievement affected interest-that is, high
   achievers expressed more interest than low achievers. The findings
   underline the importance of interest for academic choices and for
   self-regulated learning when the instructional setting is less
   structured.},

   as mediators of gender differences on mathematics subtests using

Abstract = {For 187 Grade 8 students, we compared spatial-mechanical skills with
   mathematics self-confidence as mediators of gender differences in
   mathematics. Using items showing the largest male and female advantage,
   respectively, on the Third International Mathematics and Science Study
   (TIMSS) U.S. data, we created mathematics Male and Female subtests from
   items on the 8th-grade TIMSS. Using path-analytic techniques, we
   decomposed a significant gender/mathematics correlation, favoring males,
   on the MISS-Male subtest into direct and indirect effects. We found only
   indirect effects. A spatial-mechanical composite accounted for 74\% of
   the total indirect effects, whereas mathematics self-confidence
   accounted for 26\%. By 8th grade, girls' relatively poorer
   spatial-mechanical skills contribute to lower scores on types of
   mathematics at which boys typically excel.},

Abstract = {Our goal in this study was to collect in a systematic way empirical data
   about the scope and the nature of upper elementary school pupils'
   difficulties with modeling and solving nonroutine additive word
   problems. We focused only on problems in which straightforward addition
   or subtraction of the 2 given numbers yields either 1 more or 1 less
   than the correct answer. A paper-and-pencil test containing several of
   these nonroutine items was administered to a large group of 5th and 6th
   graders, who had great difficulties in solving these problems, with
   various shortcomings underlying these difficulties. Many errors resulted
   from the superficial, stereotyped approach of adding or subtracting the
   2 given numbers without considering the appropriateness of that action
   in relation to the problem context. Other errors, however, seem to have
   different origins, such as misconceptions about numbers and arithmetic
   operations.},

Abstract = {Both counting and sharing require action on discrete elements, entailing
   the logic of one-to-one correspondence. How counting and sharing relate
   to one another was the focus of an experiment conducted to examine
   strategies preschool children used to subdivide items. We designed tasks
   in which applications of counting skills, of visual cues such as
   subitizing, and of informal measurement skills were made more difficult.
   Children exhibited alternative strategies, suggesting use of a recipient
   as a mental cycle marker and an adjacent recipient strategy, with pauses
   between allocations suggesting a re-presentation of lots corresponding
   to the number of recipients. Results supported the view that dealing
   competence does not relate directly to counting skill.},

Abstract = {This research provides information on the number sense of Taiwanese
   students in Grades 6 and 8. Data were collected with separate tests on
   written computation and number sense. Seventeen students were
   interviewed to learn more about their knowledge of number sense.
   Taiwanese students' overall performance on number sense was lower than
   their performance on written computation. Student performance on
   questions requiring written computation was significantly better than on
   similar questions relying on number sense. There was little evidence
   that identifiable components of number sense, such as use of benchmarks,
   were naturally used by Taiwanese students in their decision making. This
   research supports the need to look beyond correct answers when
   computational test results are reported.},

Abstract = {Third- through sixth-grade mathematically talented students (n = 306)
   enrolled in a flexibly paced mathematics course made achievement gains
   for beyond the normative gains expected over a one-year period.  When
   compared to students several grade levels higher, these highly able
   students gained as much as 46 percentile points from pre- to
   posttesting.  Above-grade-level testing revealed that the students
   possessed a wide range of mathematics knowledge prior to entering the
   course with some students scoring at exceptionally high levels.  With an
   individualized learning pace, some students as young as fourth grade
   completed the arithmetic/prealgebra sequence in their first year and
   returned the second year to successfully complete the beginning algebra
   sequence.  Restricting such students to a rigid instructional pace and a
   `'grade-appropriate'' curriculum may place them at risk for declines in
   motivation and achievement.},

Abstract = {In order to study learning in mathematics class discussion, we examined
   the participation, beliefs, and development of arithmetic meaning of
   four grade 3 students over one school year. In this paper, we report on
   class discussion from the perspective of one of these four students,
   Brad. Enjoying the intellectual challenges from mathematics discussions,
   Brad took an active role in making sense of other students' explanations
   and assisting mathematics communication among his classmates. In so
   doing, he created his learning opportunities. The analysis of Brad's
   arithmetical development provided additional insights into Brad's
   participation in mathematics class discussion. On the basis of this
   study, and especially the knowledge gained from Brad, we suggest that a
   fruitful mathematics class discussion necessitates the negotiation of
   social norms and mathematics meanings. Each class must work out its own
   patterns of interaction. The process of negotiation is dialectic: the
   negotiation of social norms makes possible the negotiation of
   mathematics meaning, and the negotiation of mathematics meaning makes
   possible the negotiation of social norms. Students learn how to discuss
   mathematics as a group and how to make sense of mathematical ideas as
   individuals by having the opportunities to discuss and make sense of
   different explanations.},

Abstract = {Reform in mathematics education calls for a closer tie between
   instruction and assessment. This study developed performance assessments
   from hands-on instructional activities and examined their reliability
   and validity for obtaining individual achievement data in large-scale
   surveys. The major source of unreliability was the tasks, not the
   raters. Many tasks are needed to get a dependable measure of a student's
   mathematics achievement. With respect to validity, results suggested
   that the performance assessments measure different aspects of
   mathematics achievement than do traditional multiple-choice tests.
   Moreover, the performance assessments, but not the multiple-choice test,
   distinguished the performance of students in hands-on and traditional
   curricula with the former scoring higher, on average, than the latter.
   Ethnic group comparisons indicated that Anglos scored higher, on
   average, than Latinos on all achievement measures. The magnitude of the
   difference varied by the curricular experience of the student. For
   students in traditional curricula, qualitative analysis indicates that
   Anglo and Latino students approached the problems similarly, made the
   same types of errors, and employed the same strategies in solving the
   mathematics problems.},

Abstract = {This article shows that enabling teachers to integrate comparing
   solution strategies into their teaching fosters student flexibility in
   algebra. We designed two professional development (PD) programs that
   either focused exclusively on comparing solution strategies, or
   additionally introduced the accountable talk approach to guiding
   productive classroom discussions. The effects of both PD programs were
   investigated in an experimental field study (N = 39 teachers, 739
   students). In both experimental groups, student posttest gains in
   strategy flexibility and procedural knowledge were greater than in the
   control group. The accountable talk group also increased conceptual
   knowledge. Significant effects in strategy flexibility were still
   observed 2.5 months later. We discuss recommendations for PD programs to
   foster flexibility in algebra using comparing.},

Abstract = {This multimethod study draws on theories of teacher care, dispositions,
   and culturally relevant pedagogy to examine how 12 urban mathematics
   teachers' perceptions of their own care practices align with their Black
   and Latinx students' (n = 321) sense of connectedness in the mathematics
   classroom. A qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with the
   teachers established three typologies of care: empathetic,
   transactional, and blended. A questionnaire measure of mathematics
   classroom connectedness revealed that students in classrooms led by
   teachers who enacted an empathetic caring pedagogy were more likely to
   agree that their teachers provided emotional support, their classroom
   felt like a family, and their contributions were valued in class.
   Furthermore, students' sense of classroom connectedness mediated the
   link between teacher care and the students' perceived value and
   relevance of mathematics.},
