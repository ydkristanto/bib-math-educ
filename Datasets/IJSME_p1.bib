Abstract = {In recent decades, research has stressed the prominence of mathematics
   classroom discussions in productive instructional practices in
   mathematics instruction. In this context, problem-solving activities
   have been a common focus of research. Research shows that teachers need
   to deal with prerequisites and challenges such as norms, design of
   tasks, activating students, and leading students' discussion to achieve
   a productive whole-class discussion. However, another promising activity
   for achieving productive discussions involves using a classroom response
   system and implementing different task types in a multiple-choice
   format. There is little knowledge about whole-class discussions using
   this approach. To meet this need, this paper presents results from a
   mixed-method approach that characterizes whole-class discussions to
   explore the potential of multiple-choice tasks supported by a classroom
   response system to achieve productive whole-class discussions. Three
   types of multiple-choice tasks were implemented in the classrooms of
   twelve mathematics teachers at secondary schools. The lessons, including
   35 whole-class discussions, were video-recorded, transcribed, and
   analyzed. The results summarize the characteristics of these whole-class
   discussions, including measures of students' opportunities to talk and
   teacher and student actions. These results can help us develop a more
   profound understanding of whether and how multiple-choice tasks
   supported by a classroom response system can support teachers in
   achieving productive whole-class discussions.},

Abstract = {Interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) has
   gained momentum due to increasing calls for a more STEM-literate
   society. As teaching integrated STEM poses curricular and pedagogical
   challenges for most generalist primary teachers, professional
   development (PD) is essential to support them to develop appropriate
   knowledge and efficacy to teach STEM. This paper presents a qualitative
   study of 17 primary teachers, 2 school principals and the PD
   facilitator. It explores the perceived impact of a customised
   three-phase STEM PD program on teacher efficacy in STEM education using
   Bandura's (1977) sources of efficacy as an analytic lens. The findings
   illustrate how particular features of the PD model were identified as
   contributing to the development of participating teachers' performance
   accomplishment, emotional arousal, vicarious experiences and verbal
   persuasion. In particular, there was consensus that the developmental
   structure of the STEM PD program, in terms of teachers' assuming
   increasing ownership for their STEM learning, incrementally enhanced
   teacher efficacy in STEM education. Implications of this study for STEM
   education and in particular STEM PD are discussed fully.},

Abstract = {The purpose of current study was to investigate the effect of conceptual
   change-oriented instruction accompanied by conceptual change texts
   enriched with concept cartoons, gender, and their interaction on primary
   preservice teachers' conceptual understanding and their attitudes
   towards simple electricity. Participants were 225 sophomores from six
   intact classes in a state university. A quasi-experimental design was
   used and the study lasted in 3-week treatment period. The experimental
   group studied the simple electricity concept with the application of the
   conceptual change texts enriched with concept cartoons and the control
   group studied it with traditional instruction. Seven conceptual change
   texts with concept cartoons were developed, keeping students'
   misconceptions in mind. Students' conceptual understanding and attitudes
   were measured by two-tired misconception test and physics attitude scale
   respectively. They were administered as pre- and post-tests before and
   after instructions. The main effects of treatment, gender, and their
   interaction on post-test scores were examined via MANCOVA with
   pre-conceptual understanding and pre-attitude scores used as covariates.
   The analyses yielded a significant treatment effect, but insignificant
   gender and gender x treatment interaction effects on the collective
   dependent variables of the post-test scores. The ANCOVA results revealed
   that the conceptual change-oriented instruction affected students'
   conceptual understanding significantly with respect to traditional
   instruction, but it had insignificant effect on their attitudes. This
   study revealed that the use of the conceptual change texts enriched with
   concept cartoons is likely to be effective for primary preservice
   teachers' conceptual understanding in teaching simple electricity.},

Abstract = {Reading comprehension is an essential skill for learning in general and
   in science classes. Problems with reading comprehension might hinder
   students' participation in learning science. Text in science includes
   specific language features that distinguishes it from narrative text, so
   should reading instruction be part of teaching science? The direct and
   inferential mediation (DIME) model of reading comprehension subsumes
   factors that influence reading comprehension. It was tested separately
   regarding narrative text as well as expository text in English; however,
   both have not been tested by directly comparing them to each other. In
   this study, we investigated to what degree general reading comprehension
   of narrative text is directly comparable to topic-specific reading
   comprehension of science text. Hence, first the applicability of the
   DIME model of reading comprehension in another language (i.e. German)
   was tested. Second, a general reading comprehension model was directly
   compared to a topic-specific model for reading comprehension of science
   text. Participants across the two studies were 704 German Grade 8
   students who completed measures of comprehension and the DIME predictor
   variables. Results of two path analyses indicate the general
   applicability of the model for another language and additionally for
   both genres. However, some differences are highlighted that may be of
   importance in future science-specific studies as well as for teaching
   science.},

Abstract = {East Asian students have consistently performed well in mathematics
   compared to their international peers. Though many researchers have
   attempted to explore the factors that underpin their success, most
   studies have focused only on a limited set of variables. Mathematics
   achievement, however, is a complex phenomenon, determined by multiple
   factors, and best understood when different variables across levels of
   analysis are taken into account. Guided by the socio-ecological theory,
   the present study attempts to understand the relative importance of
   individual, microsystem, and mesosystem factors in predicting
   mathematics achievement. We used the Trends in International Mathematics
   and Science Study (TIMSS) 2019 data provided by 21,340 eighth-grade East
   Asian students (Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and Singapore),
   1242 mathematics teachers, and 802 principals. Machine learning (i.e.,
   random forest regression) was used to analyze the data. Results
   identified 11 key variables that best predicted East Asian students'
   mathematics achievement. Among these, students' confidence in
   mathematics, socioeconomic status, and school emphasis on academic
   success were the top three. Theoretical and practical implications are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Whilst spatial reasoning skills have been found to predict mathematical
   achievement, little is known about how primary (elementary) students'
   conceptual understanding of three-dimensional objects develops. In this
   article, we report a qualitative study and the impact of rich learning
   experiences on 48 Years 3-6 students' geometric reasoning relating to
   prisms. A one-to-one task-based interview, refined by the researchers,
   was used to assess student learning. Coding and data analysis were
   informed by our previous research. The findings reveal noticeable shifts
   in students' knowledge of and reasoning about prisms, their ability to
   construct and describe prisms with geometric language, and their
   visualisation and spatial structuring skills. The implications of these
   findings highlight the importance of teachers' choice of tasks that
   require students to compose and decompose three-dimensional (3D)
   objects; compare 3D objects through physical and mental transformations;
   take different perspectives; and visualise and reason geometrically.},

Abstract = {Semiotics is the study of symbols and the creation of their meaning
   through social interactions. In this paper, we explore more deeply the
   socially situated nature of semiotics by extending current semiotics
   theories and frameworks from the perspective of emergent modeling. The
   first expansion is to replace the interpretant (meaning associated with
   symbols) with a construct that comes from social constructivism, namely
   taken-as-shared mathematical ideas. The second involves integrating
   purpose into semiotic frameworks. Finally, we broaden the time span that
   is typical for semiotic analyses to account for 5 weeks of collective
   activity and describe an argumentation analytic technique for doing so.
   We do all of this from the point of view of instructional designers who
   use realistic mathematics education and consider emergent modeling as a
   lynchpin of instruction.},

Abstract = {Little is known about discrete emotions experienced by mathematics
   teachers beyond mathematics anxiety in elementary school. In order to
   fill this gap, the aim of this research is to identify emotions, and
   their triggering situations, experienced by secondary school Mexican
   mathematics teachers inside and outside of the classroom. This research
   considered 180 written narratives of emotional experiences (positives
   and negatives) of 18 secondary school in-service Mexican mathematics
   teachers. We use the cognitive theory of emotions to identify emotions
   and we carry out a thematic analysis to identify the situations that
   trigger emotions. Results show nine positive and seven negative emotions
   unleashed by 28 triggering situations; the results are consistent with
   the research literature on teachers' emotions that highlights that the
   main sources of teachers emotions are behaviour, motivation and academic
   achievement of their students. Their academic achievement and learning
   triggers happy-for, appreciation, pride and gratitude and their lack of
   engagement and motivation triggers disappointment, reproach and anger.},

Abstract = {The scientist-practitioner gap refers to the phenomenon of individuals
   with a scientific background exhibiting non-scientific beliefs. Informed
   by the social-cognitive process model, this study aimed to develop a
   more coherent understanding of how such non-scientific beliefs can be
   predicted by individuals' cognitive flexibility mediated by their
   epistemic curiosity. A questionnaire was administered to 332
   undergraduate students majoring in science at 2 universities in Taiwan.
   It included items on cognitive flexibility, 2 types of epistemic
   curiosity, and non-scientific beliefs. After the reliability and
   validity of the items and constructs were validated, structural equation
   modeling was applied to verify the research model. Results indicated
   that the 2 types of epistemic curiosity, interest-type and
   deprivation-type, were positively predicted by cognitive flexibility but
   were negatively reflected in the students' non-scientific beliefs. The
   study also tested the gender difference for each factor and found that
   female students majoring in science tended to have stronger
   non-scientific beliefs than their male counterparts. The results imply
   that if a higher level of cognitive flexibility is attained, the
   scientist-practitioner gap may be reduced.},

Abstract = {This study is an investigation of the possible relationship between
   clinical interview skills and teacher noticing. In a multiple case
   study, video-recordings of pre-service teachers' (PSTs') mathematical
   clinical interviews and their written critiques of a mathematics lesson
   were examined using qualitative content analysis. Findings suggest that
   there are some relationships between the PSTs' clinical interview skills
   and their noticing expertise. Conceptual interview skills such as paying
   attention to students' mathematical thinking; evaluating the validity,
   generalizability, or efficiency of students' mathematical ideas; and
   recognizing their conceptual difficulties constitute a common core to
   explain the possible relationship. The theoretical and empirical
   implications and the limitations of the study are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study is an investigation of elementary preservice teachers'
   (PSTs') exploration of model breaking points in fractions. Eighty-three
   PSTs at two universities in the Midwestern and Southwestern regions of
   the USA were asked to explore the area model of fraction addition
   through a series of tasks and explain their reasoning in determining its
   affordances and constraints. The PSTs presented their critical
   mathematical ideas on modeling fraction addition and area models'
   breaking points when used to add two fractions, as well as suggestions
   for alternative models to overcome model breaking points. An inductive
   content analysis showed that most PSTs represented fraction addition
   well with simple fractions but had difficulty representing fraction
   addition with improper fractions or fractions with unlike and relatively
   large denominators and tended to use algorithm-based thinking. Also, the
   area models drawn by several PSTs revealed various misconceptions,
   suggesting the impact of their content knowledge on their understanding
   of area models. Based on the findings from this study, we provide some
   implications for teacher educators.},

Abstract = {Practical work is widely seen as an important element of the science
   curriculum. However, there is a long-standing debate about the
   educational aims of practical work and about why it is important. Aims
   suggested include the contributions that practical work can make to
   understanding, to the acquisition of professional and personal skills,
   and to motivation. However, several authors have argued that the actual
   contributions made are minimal and there is ongoing pressure to justify
   the continuing inclusion of practical work in a period when greater cost
   efficiency is required from all those involved in education. Such
   pressures are extreme in countries that face resource challenges. This
   study examines current views on the aims of practical physics teaching
   in sub-Saharan Africa. Data were gathered from staff and students in
   four countries across the region through surveys and interviews. A
   context was provided by observation of practice and inspection of
   background documents. The overt educational aims of the staff are
   consistent with previous analyses though there is a heightened priority
   given to the improvement of content knowledge and understanding.
   However, there are additional drivers of behaviour that, to a large
   extent, define the observed practice. These `pragmatic aims' concern
   mainly the practicalities of running schools with limited material and
   staff resources but also arise from cultural expectations and societal
   needs. Although the formal data is derived from the secondary sector, it
   is of relevance to all educational levels.},

Abstract = {Peer assessment has been shown to advance learning, for example, by
   improving one's work, but the variance of learning benefits within or
   between studies has not been explained. The purpose of this case study
   was to examine what kinds of pathways students have through peer
   assessment and to study which factors affect them when peer assessment
   is implemented in the early stage of physics studies in the context of
   conducting and reporting inquiry. Data sources used include field notes,
   audio recordings of lessons, student lab reports, written peer feedback,
   and student interviews. We examined peer assessment from the perspective
   of individual students and found 3 profiles of peer assessment: (1)
   students that improved their lab report after peer assessment and
   expressed other benefits, (2) students that did not improve their lab
   report but expressed other benefits, and (3) students that did not
   experience any benefits. Three factors were found to explain these
   differences in students' pathways: (1) students' engagement in
   conducting and reporting inquiry, (2) the quality of received feedback,
   and (3) students' understanding of formative assessment. Most students
   experienced some benefits of peer assessment, even if they did not put
   effort into their own work or receive constructive feedback.
   Nevertheless, in this case study, both improving one's work and
   experiencing other benefits of peer assessment required sufficient
   accomplishment of all 3 factors.},

Abstract = {This paper explores final-year physical sciences preservice teachers'
   religious and scientific views regarding the origin of the universe and
   life. Data was obtained from 10 preservice teachers from individual
   in-depth interviews conducted at the end of the Science Method module.
   Their viewpoints were analyzed using coding, sorting, and categorizing.
   They attributed the origin of the universe and life to a blend of
   theistic, intelligent design or scientific beliefs. Moreover, their
   academic backgrounds, exposure to topics in Cosmology in the Science
   Method module, and classroom dialogues did not significantly influence
   or change their original religious beliefs. However, the dialogues did
   create an awareness of their own reflected positions regarding the
   tenacity of beliefs in religion and their inadequate cosmological
   understandings. The paper has implications for Science Education in
   addressing preservice teachers' religious beliefs in contrast to
   scientific evidence.},

Abstract = {The present study focused on an in-depth understanding of student
   motivation and self-regulated learning in mathematics and science
   through cluster analysis. It examined the different learning profiles of
   motivational beliefs and self-regulatory strategies in relation to
   perceived teacher autonomy support, basic psychological needs (i.e.
   autonomy, competence, and relatedness), motivational regulations, and
   academic achievement. Grounded in self-determination theory, this study
   examined the learning profiles of 782 students from eight secondary
   schools in Singapore. The cluster analyzes revealed four distinct
   learning profiles, and they were compared in association with perceived
   teacher autonomy support, needs satisfaction, motivational regulations,
   and grades. Cluster profiling enables teachers to have better
   understanding of their students' self-regulated learning so that they
   can apply effective teaching strategies to foster their motivation. The
   findings offer a perspective to secondary students' psychological needs
   along with some insights into their perceived task value and
   self-efficacy in the contexts of mathematics and science.},

Abstract = {The Framework for Science Education and the Next Generation Science
   Standards in the USA emphasize learning progressions (LPs) that support
   conceptual coherence and the gradual building of knowledge over time. In
   the domain of genetics there are two independently developed alternative
   LPs. In essence, the difference between the two progressions hinges on
   conjectures regarding the accessibility of Mendelian versus molecular
   genetics, the conceptual dependencies between them, and the order in
   which they should be taught. The discrepancies between the two
   progressions stem, in part, from gaps in the current research base. To
   address the question of whether learning one aspect of genetics,
   Mendelian or molecular, supports the learning of the other, we analyzed
   correlations between students' test scores on item subsets for Mendelian
   and molecular genetics on written pre-post assessments. Students were
   seventh graders who received intensive instruction in Mendelian and
   molecular genetics. We found that students' pretest scores on the
   molecular items were moderately correlated with their posttest scores on
   the Mendelian genetics item set (but not the other way around). This
   suggests that molecular genetics understandings may bootstrap the
   learning of Mendelian genetics. Implying that, in contrast to prevalent
   practice, molecular genetics should be taught before Mendelian genetics.},

Title = {STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES UTILIZED IN ANALYZING PISA AND TIMSS DATA IN
   SCIENCE EDUCATION FROM 1996 TO 2013: A METHODOLOGICAL REVIEW},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {We conducted a methodological review of articles using the Programme for
   International Student Assessment (PISA) or Trends in International
   Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data published by the SSCI-indexed
   science education journals, such as the International Journal of Science
   and Mathematics Education, the International Journal of Science
   Education, the Journal of Research in Science Teaching, and Science
   Education, from 1996 to 2013. A total of 51 empirical articles from 8
   journals were identified as the sample for this study. These articles
   were analyzed in terms of the 2 essential statistical techniques,
   sampling weights and design effects, used to analyze the international
   large-scale assessment (ILSA) data. The study also summarized the most
   commonly used quantitative methods for analyzing PISA and TIMSS data in
   these articles. The results indicate that the weights and design
   effects, essential adjustments for analyzing large-scale data, were
   reported in less than half of the studies. Suggestions regarding the use
   of appropriate techniques and reporting as well as data analysis methods
   are made for science education researchers who use ILSA data in their
   research.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine early mathematical skill
   differences among preschool children in US Head Start classrooms. Latent
   class analysis based on six early mathematical subtest scores (i.e.
   counting aloud, measurement, counting objects, numbers and shapes,
   pattern recognition, and grouping) from a sample of 279 Head Start
   children yielded evidence for a high-achieving class, a
   typical-achieving class, and a low-achieving class, relative to other
   children attending Head Start. Average skill profiles of the three
   latent classes were in general parallel to one another, reflecting that
   most of the differences across latent classes were in level rather than
   type of skills. Changes in subtest scores over a 3-month interval
   indicated that the skill levels of the low-achieving class at time 2
   were still below those of the typically achieving class at time 1. These
   findings provide evidence for skill variability among children enrolled
   in Head Start and a group of children who appear unlikely to demonstrate
   the skill level of their peers without additional instruction or
   intervention.},

Abstract = {We examined the effect of curriculum organization in US high schools
   where students could freely choose to study mathematics from textbooks
   that employed one of two types of content organization, an integrated
   approach or a (traditional) subject-specific approach. The study
   involved 2,242 high school students, enrolled in either Course 3 or
   Algebra 2, in 10 schools in 5 geographically dispersed states. Taking
   account of curriculum implementation and students' prior mathematics
   learning, we analyzed two end-of-year outcome measures: a test of common
   objectives and a standardized achievement test. Our hierarchical linear
   models with three levels showed that students in the integrated
   curriculum scored significantly higher than those in the
   subject-specific curriculum on the common objectives test. In both
   outcome measures, gender and prior achievement were significant
   student-level predictors. In the standardized achievement test,
   ethnicity was a moderating factor. At the teacher-level, in addition to
   curriculum type, teachers' orientation and free and reduced lunch
   eligibility were significant moderating factors. Opportunity to learn,
   implementation fidelity, teacher experience, and professional
   development were not significant predictors.},

   documented and analyzed using an EyeLink 1000 eye tracker. The results
   suggest that illustrations received less attention than print; however,
   readers who had more fixations on illustrations had better
   comprehension. While both headings and captions were in the print
   category, the headings received much less attention than did the
   captions. The article concludes with implications for teaching science
   reading and suggestions for future research beyond this exploratory case
   study.},

Abstract = {The ``Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics{''}
   assessed the knowledge of primary and lower-secondary teachers at the
   end of their training. The large-scale assessment represented the common
   denominator of what constitutes mathematics content knowledge and
   mathematics pedagogical content knowledge in the 16 participating
   countries. The country means provided information on the overall teacher
   performance in these 2 areas. By detecting and explaining differential
   item functioning (DIF), this paper goes beyond the country means and
   investigates item-by-item strengths and weaknesses of future teachers.
   We hypothesized that due to differences in the cultural context,
   teachers from different countries responded differently to subgroups of
   test items with certain item characteristics. Content domains, cognitive
   demands (including item difficulty), and item format represented, in
   fact, such characteristics: They significantly explained variance in
   DIF. Country pairs showed similar patterns in the relationship of DIF to
   the item characteristics. Future teachers from Taiwan and Singapore were
   particularly strong on mathematics content and constructed-response
   items. Future teachers from Russia and Poland were particularly strong
   on items requiring non-standard mathematical operations. The USA and
   Norway did particularly well on mathematics pedagogical content and data
   items. Thus, conditional on the countries' mean performance, the
   knowledge profiles of the future teachers matched the respective
   national debates. This result points to the influences of the cultural
   context on mathematics teacher knowledge.},

Abstract = {In this study, we looked at the impact of our specially designed
   inquiry-based science courses for pre-service elementary teachers on
   their science content knowledge as measured by a high-stakes state
   certification test for elementary education. We conducted a
   pre/post-analysis of the certification test scores of 1,003 pre-service
   teachers. Cohort 1 consisted of 424 students who took the test prior to
   implementation of our reformed science courses. Cohort 2 consisted of
   579 students taking the test after complete implementation. We examined
   overall test scores, science subscores, total science credits, age, and
   science transfer credits. We found that the overall test score dropped
   significantly from cohort 1 to cohort 2, but the science subscores
   remained unchanged. Our results showed that students who took all 3 of
   the science content courses vs. none scored significantly higher on the
   science portion, non-traditional students (older than 25) scored
   similarly to traditional-aged students, and there was a negative
   correlation with the number of science courses transferred. Of
   importance is the fact that students who took the minimal number of
   science courses and are less interested in science passed the science
   portion at the same rate (over 90\%) as science majors and minors. We
   conclude that our pre-service elementary teachers can and do learn
   science content using inquiry as recommended by the National Science
   Education Standards (NRC, 1996).},

Abstract = {In this report, we adapt and extend a methodology for documenting the
   collective production of meaning in a classroom community. A cornerstone
   of the methodological approach that we develop is a close examination of
   classroom discourse. Our efforts to analyze the collective production of
   meaning by examining classroom interaction are compatible with the
   relatively recent emphasis in mathematics and science education research
   that focuses on how communities of learners establish ideas through
   discourse and inquiry. The methodological approach we take builds on and
   extends an approach from mathematics education that uses Toulmin's
   argumentation model to document and analyze students' conceptual
   progress. Our modification introduces a new criterion for empirically
   demonstrating when particular ways of reasoning become part of the
   normative practices of the community. An example from an undergraduate
   course in physical chemistry is used to illustrate the methodology.},

Abstract = {In an effort to gain a better understanding of Chinese classroom
   teaching culture, this study aimed to examine elementary teachers' views
   about a good mathematics lesson in China. Through analyzing 57 teachers'
   essays collected from 7 elementary schools in 2 provinces, it is found
   that Chinese teachers emphasized the most about students and their
   learning in their descriptions of a good mathematics lesson. However, in
   describing what it takes to develop a good mathematics lesson, they
   thought more about teachers and their knowing and understanding of
   textbooks than about students. The results revealed a picture of Chinese
   teachers' thinking about a good mathematics lesson that is different
   from what has been reported about US teachers' views. The findings
   suggest that examining teachers' thinking about good teaching is
   valuable for understanding cross-cultural differences in mathematics
   classroom instruction.},

Abstract = {The study investigated the impact on student motivation and
   understanding of magnetism of teaching sequences based on an inductive
   approach. The study was conducted in large lecture classes. A pre- and
   post-Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism was conducted with
   just fewer than 700 Thai undergraduate science students, before and
   after being taught the concepts, in three academic years. For 2005 and
   2006, overall, the students had a better understanding of concepts
   associated with electricity, but a majority of the students seemed not
   to understand magnetism after the teaching. Drawing on these findings,
   the teaching sequences of the magnetism topic were developed, and then
   implemented in the academic year 2007. The teaching sequences included
   demonstrations and visuals to help students infer rules and theories for
   themselves (inductive method). In addition, interactive notes,
   information on historical science discoveries about magnetic phenomenon,
   questions, student discussions, and magnetism problems were used to
   support student learning during lectures. Students in the academic year
   2007 performed significantly better after the teaching. In addition, the
   students had a positive perception towards the teaching sequences, which
   allowed them to be involved more actively during lectures.},

Abstract = {The present study explores students' abilities in conversions between
   geometric and algebraic representations, in problem-solving situations
   involving the concept of ``limit{''} and the interrelation of these
   abilities with students' constructed understanding of this concept. An
   attempt is also made to examine the impact of the ``didactic
   contract{''} on students' performance through the processes they employ
   in tackling specific tasks on the concept of limit. Data were collected
   from 222 12th-grade high school students in Greece. The results
   indicated that students who had constructed a conceptual understanding
   of limit were the ones most probable to accomplish the conversions of
   limits from the algebraic to the geometric representations and the
   reverse. The findings revealed the compartmentalized way of students'
   thinking in non-routine problems by means of their performance in
   simpler conversion tasks. Students who did not perform under the
   conditions of the didactic contract were found to be more consistent in
   their responses for various conversion tasks and complex problems on
   limits, compared to students who, as a consequence of the didactic
   contract, used only algorithmic processes.},

Abstract = {This study developed, validated, and utilized the Technology Integrated
   Classroom Inventory (TICI) to examine technology-integrated science
   learning environments as perceived by secondary school students and
   teachers. Using technology-oriented classroom climate instruments and
   considering the science classroom's characteristics, TICI was developed.
   More than 1,100 seventh through ninth grade science students validated
   the instrument, revealing eight scales: technological enrichment,
   inquiry learning, equity and friendliness, student cohesiveness,
   understanding and encouragement, competition and efficacy, audiovisual
   environment, and order, with alpha reliabilities ranging between 0.69
   and 0.91 (0.93 for the entire questionnaire). In measuring actual and
   preferred learning environments, TICI results indicated that both
   students and teachers ranked equity and friendliness highest. The
   largest actual-preferred discrepancy was order (students) and inquiry
   learning (teachers). TICI offers additional utilities for
   technology-enriched science leaning environments.},

   Theory Analysis of Teaching Mathematics Out-of-Field in a Small School},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 22},
Abstract = {This paper employs Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as an
   analytical heuristic in exploring the internationally prevalent
   situation of teaching out-of-field. Drawing on interview transcripts, we
   use CHAT to frame the activity of a young teacher teaching mathematics
   out-of-field in a small rural K-12 school in Australia. We identify and
   map some important elements and tensions of out-of-field mathematics
   teaching, how these tensions change over time and how this activity
   interacts with in-field teaching. Finally, we consider emotions and
   identity in relation to the structural elements of CHAT mediational
   triangles to more fully explore and represent some of the complexities
   of teaching mathematics out-of-field in a small rural school and
   implications for responding to the out-of-field phenomenon.},

Abstract = {This study explored 54 preservice elementary teachers' identification
   and modification of mathematical tasks in raising cognitive demand and
   examined the features of their modified tasks. The study collected data
   using a three-phase activity: (a) identifying the level of cognitive
   demand of the given task, (b) modifying the low cognitive demand tasks
   to higher ones, and (c) presenting anticipated student responses to the
   modified tasks. Through the inductive content analysis approach, the
   study revealed the following findings: (a) the participants were more
   successful in identifying lower-level tasks than higher-level ones; (b)
   the participants modified mainly three task features (task formats,
   response types, and complexity) to increase the level of cognitive
   demand of tasks, and more varied modification strategies were observed
   when the given task's level was the lowest; (c) the researchers'
   evaluation of the participants' modified tasks showed that their
   attempts did not always guarantee the change of the level of cognitive
   demand in some cases; (d) in some cases, the participants' anticipated
   student responses contained erroneous content, and story problems used
   in the modified tasks were unreasonable. This study contributed to
   understanding preservice teachers' competency in identifying the level
   of cognitive demand of mathematical tasks and their modification
   strategies and errors. The findings also offered implications for
   further discussions to be considered in mathematics teacher education.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Instructional quality dimensions of cognitive demands and instructional
   support have been shown to have an impact on students' learning gains.
   Existing operationalizations of these dimensions have mostly used
   comprehensive ratings that combine various subdimensions of task quality
   and interaction quality. The current study disentangles interaction
   quality in a video data corpus study (of 49 middle school classrooms
   sharing the same tasks) to identify those quality features that predict
   students' learning gains in conceptual understanding. The regression
   analysis reveals that quality features of students' individual
   engagement do not predict individual student learning, whereas teachers'
   support of learning content-relevant vocabulary predicts the small
   groups' learning. For at-risk students, the collective time spent on
   conceptual practices (i.e. explaining meanings of concepts) on students'
   learning is significantly predictive. The observation that different
   operationalizations (for similar aspects of interaction quality) lead to
   different impacts on the learning gains contributes to ongoing research
   efforts to refine and increase insight into aspects of interaction
   quality.},

Abstract = {Teachers' job satisfaction and teacher self-efficacy in teaching are two
   of the main factors driving STEM teacher shortages in teaching students
   who are English Learners (ELs). This study investigated the impact of
   teachers' perceptions of school climate and professional development
   (PD) participation on teacher self-efficacy in teaching and job
   satisfaction for STEM teachers of ELs. The public dataset TALIS 2018,
   including 985 public middle school STEM teachers of ELs in the USA, was
   used for the path analysis. The results showed that PD participation in
   multicultural education and STEM teachers' perceptions of school climate
   had significantly positive direct effects on job satisfaction and
   self-efficacy in teaching ELs. Additionally, findings showed that STEM
   teacher self-efficacy in teaching mediates the relationship between
   school climate and teachers' job satisfaction. This study contributes to
   the body of knowledge based on developing the capacity of STEM teachers
   of ELs and provides recommendations for future STEM teacher PD programs.},

Abstract = {Preservice middle school mathematics teachers' (PMTs) beliefs about a
   mathematics teacher and mathematics teaching were investigated through
   the metaphors they generated. Third- and fourth-year PMTs (N = 249) at
   four universities in Turkiye participated in two anonymous metaphor
   tasks for a mathematics teacher and mathematics teaching. PMTs'
   metaphors were first analysed by the framework developed for and used in
   previous studies exploring teachers' metaphors (Lofstrom et al., 2011)
   with further elaborations. PMTs' metaphors for a mathematics teacher and
   mathematics teaching were categorised and compared. Then, deeper
   analyses of hybrid, self-referential, and contextual metaphors were
   conducted. Findings revealed that PMTs mostly used didactical expert and
   self-referential metaphors for the mathematics teacher and hybrid and
   self-referential metaphors for mathematics teaching. PMTs' beliefs about
   mathematics teaching seemed to be more multifaceted than their beliefs
   about a mathematics teacher. The deeper analyses showed that PMTs
   associated both the teacher and teaching with positive and/or negative
   connotations in their self-referential and contextual metaphors.
   Documenting these beliefs through metaphors allowed us to explore and
   understand the nature of PMTs' beliefs and showed that metaphor tasks
   could be useful for detecting beliefs.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this article was to understand the current situation
   and challenges of the integration of mathematics and science (IMS) in
   Chinese primary schools. We used a questionnaire responded to by 453
   primary school mathematics/science teachers and interviewed 7 teachers
   among them. Research showed that Chinese primary school teachers had a
   positive attitude toward IMS, but their beliefs about IMS were not high.
   Most teachers ever integrated mathematics/science in their class, but
   they did not have a complete understanding of the form of IMS in their
   minds. Results revealed that IMS in Chinese primary schools faced some
   challenges, such as teachers' incomplete perceptions of IMS, lack of
   resources, and insufficient school support and time. Finally, we
   proposed some recommendations for better implementation of IMS. This
   research would help policymakers, curriculum developers, educators, and
   primary teachers in China have an overall picture of IMS.},

Abstract = {Science teachers in many countries were required to shift from
   face-to-face (F2F) instruction to distance learning (DL) during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. With the aim of helping science teachers learn how to
   support their students in negotiating such shifts in the future, we used
   an online motivation survey based on achievement goal theory to
   investigate the shifts to over two thousand 8th grade students'
   perceptions of their science teachers' motivational practices and their
   own goal orientations towards science that occurred during the
   transition from F2F instruction to DL in two very different countries,
   China and Israel. We hoped to identify issues common to both countries,
   assuming that these issues might be relevant to other countries as well.
   Factor analysis, t-tests, and multiple regression were used to identify
   key teacher motivational practices, changes to these practices and to
   students' goal orientations, and relations between teacher practices and
   student goal orientations. The major predictor of students' mastery
   orientation towards science in both F2F instruction and DL, teachers'
   attentiveness to their students' need to understand, declined for
   students in both countries during the shift from F2F to DL, and was
   associated with a decline in students' mastery orientation, engagement,
   and enjoyment.},

Abstract = {Minority ethnic women are underrepresented in Science, Technology,
   Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) higher education. Whilst existing
   studies, mostly in the US context, have provided valuable insights into
   racial and gender inequalities, there appears to be limited research in
   the UK. Through the lens of science identity, this article draws on
   qualitative data which was collected over three years, to appreciate how
   minority ethnic women develop their identity and belonging in STEM
   higher education, from the start to the end of their degrees. We present
   three case studies: (1) Nancy, a British East Asian Computer Science
   student, who appears pragmatic as she understands the extrinsic value of
   her degree, despite negative feelings and experiences; (2) Carol, a
   Black British Biomedical student, who can be seen as persistent, as
   supported by her intrinsic commitment to work in healthcare; and (3)
   Mawiya, a British Middle Eastern Mathematics student, whose experiences
   are somewhat precarious, because she must continuously negotiate her
   mathematics identity, which is often in question by herself and others.
   We discuss and compare the similarities and differences in the higher
   education pathways of these students. We also highlight the nuances of
   identity development and identity management, and consider multiple
   social inequalities for minority ethnic women. We conclude with a
   discussion of the implications of the findings for policy and practice.},

Title = {The Role of Metalanguage in an Explicit Literacy Instruction on
   Scientific Explanation},

Abstract = {This paper illustrates the role of metalanguage in an explicit literacy
   instruction to talk about the forms and functions of scientific genres,
   particularly the genre of explanation. In the context of science,
   metalanguage refers to the technical terms for talkingaboutscientific
   language using words like law, hypothesis, and evidence. Despite many
   efforts to use literacy strategies to address the challenges of learning
   scientific language, the conventional genres commonly found in science
   remain implicit in most science classroom teaching. In order to
   explicitly discuss the nature of scientific genres and how they are
   linked to scientific practices, scientific metalanguage provides a
   potential literacy tool. To illustrate this argument, we draw on a case
   study where four teachers and their grade 9 students learned how to use
   a specific type of metalanguage to describe scientific explanation.
   Analysis of their classroom discourse showed that the use of the
   metalanguage facilitated explicit communication about the logical
   sequence, epistemic structure, and validity of scientific explanation.
   Based on the findings, we discuss the usefulness of metalanguage for
   teachers and students to describe and analyze scientific genres as well
   as how these genres are used to construct and communicate scientific
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {In many countries, integrating engineering into science education is
   regarded as the best means of improving science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. In Mainland China, some
   efforts have been made to integrate engineering into science, but
   problems regarding teacher factors hinder its effective implementation.
   To address these problems, we conducted a survey together with classroom
   observations and interviews to explore science teachers' perceptions of
   the integration of engineering into science (IEIS) with aims of exposing
   the problems and the status of IEIS implementation. The study involved
   1185 science teachers from junior secondary schools in Shanghai. Ten
   teachers were interviewed, and 5 teachers' classrooms were observed. The
   findings of mixed research methods revealed the science teachers
   generally established good understanding of engineering and engineering
   education; however, the problems are (1) science teachers failed to
   identify engineering practices and scientific practices, (2) they
   designed and implemented IEIS in low integration levels with low
   cognition level of engineering education, and (3) there was a lack of
   high-quality IEIS training programme for STEM education. The results of
   this study will inform science teacher education and STEM
   implementation.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to promote scientific literacy among sports majors who
   were not interested in learning about science via a course called
   Addressing Macroscopic Issues in Biochemistry and Sports (AMIBAS). The
   participants were 54 students majoring in sports at an Indonesian
   university. Using a 1 group pre-post study design, students were
   required to participate in 2 consecutive biochemistry
   courses-conventional course and the AMIBAS course. The first part
   involved conventional teaching prior to administering a pretest, and
   AMIBAS was conducted in the second part, after the pretest. The 2 parts
   were conducted during two 7-week periods for 4 h a week. Data analysis
   results showed that the scientific literacy levels of 56\% of the
   students rose from a nominal-functional level (pretest) to a
   conceptual-multidimensional level (posttest). Students' attitudes toward
   biochemistry also became more positive. The students were able to
   macroscopically explain biochemistry-related issues. However, they were
   unable to describe issues microscopically, due to a lack of preexisting
   biochemistry knowledge, mental habits oriented toward macroscopic
   thinking, and inadequate science communication. Sharing, feedback, and
   discussion can scaffold students' learning and help them to explain
   biochemistry and sports-related issues in more scientific terms, change
   their habits of mind, and become more scientifically literate.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research focuses on what outcomes to assess in
   makerspaces, and appropriate formats for capturing those outcomes (e.g.
   reflections, surveys, and portfolios). Linguistic analysis as a data
   mining technique holds promise for revealing different dimensions of
   learning exhibited by students in makerspaces. In this study, student
   reflections on makerspace projects were gathered in 2 formats over 2
   years: private written assessments captured in the 3D GameLab
   gamification platform, and semi-public video-recorded assessments posted
   in the more social FlipGrid platform. Transcripts of student assessments
   were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) to generate 4
   summary variables thought to inform makerspace outcomes of interest
   (i.e. analytical thinking, authenticity, clout, and emotional tone).
   Comparative findings indicate that written assessments may elicit more
   analytical thinking about maker projects compared with less analytical
   conversation in videos, while video assessments may elicit somewhat
   higher clout scores as evidence of social scaffolding along with a much
   more positive emotional tone. Recommendations are provided for layering
   assessment approaches to maximize the potential benefits of each format,
   including reflective writing for social spaces, in social groups, and
   about design processes and procedures.},

Abstract = {An important goal in school algebra is to help students notice the
   covariational nature of functional relationships, how the values of
   variables change in relation to each other. This study explored 102 Year
   7 (12 to 13-year-old) students' covariational reasoning with their
   constructed graphs for figural growing patterns they had generalised. A
   sequence of figural pattern generalisation tasks was incorporated in
   their school's linear equations topic, before formal introduction to
   linear graphs. The aim was to see if or how the students described
   covariation features of their graph and connected them to their
   generalisation. Evidence was found for a noticeable increase in both the
   students' use of symbolic algebra for their pattern generalisation and
   knowledge of Cartesian plane graphing conventions, but not for
   increasing covariational reasoning with their graphs or connections to
   their generalisation. Possible implications and further research
   directions on graphing in a pattern generalisation context are
   discussed.},

Title = {Students' Creative Process in Mathematics: Insights from
   Eye-Tracking-Stimulated Recall Interview on Students' Work on Multiple

Abstract = {Students' creative process in mathematics is increasingly gaining
   significance in mathematics education research. Researchers often use
   Multiple Solution Tasks (MSTs) to foster and evaluate students'
   mathematical creativity. Yet, research so far predominantly had a
   product-view and focused on solutions rather than the process leading to
   creative insights. The question remains unclear how students' process
   solving MSTs looks like-and if existing models to describe (creative)
   problem solving can capture this process adequately. This article
   presents an explorative, qualitative case study, which investigates the
   creative process of a school student, David. Using eye-tracking
   technology and a stimulated recall interview, we trace David's creative
   process. Our findings indicate what phases his creative process in the
   MST involves, how new ideas emerge, and in particular where illumination
   is situated in this process. Our case study illustrates that neither
   existing models on the creative process, nor on problem solving capture
   David's creative process fully, indicating the need to partially rethink
   students' creative process in MSTs.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce and discuss a construct called graphical
   forms, an extension of Sherin's symbolic forms. In its original
   conceptualization, symbolic forms characterize the ideas students
   associate with patterns in a mathematical expression. To expand symbolic
   forms beyond only characterizing mathematical equations, we use the
   general term registration to describe structural features attended to by
   individuals (parts of an equation or regions in a graph). When
   mathematical ideas are assigned to registrations in a graph, we
   characterize this as reasoning using graphical forms. As an analytic
   framework, graphical forms provide the language to discuss intuitive
   mathematical ideas associated with features in a graph, but we are also
   interested in engagement in modeling. Our approach to investigating
   graphical reasoning involves conceptualizing modeling as discussing
   mathematical narratives. This affords the language to describe reasoning
   about the process (or ``story{''}) that could give rise to a graph; in
   practice, this occurs when mathematical reasoning (i.e. reasoning using
   graphical forms) is integrated with context-specific ideas. In this work
   we describe graphical forms as an extension of symbolic forms and
   emphasize its utility for analyzing graphical reasoning. In order to
   illustrate how the framework could be applied, we provide examples of
   interpretations of graphs across disciplines, using graphs selected from
   introductory biology, calculus, chemistry, and physics textbooks.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing number of inclusive STEM schools, little is known
   about the cultural dimensions that influence STEM curriculum and
   instruction within these schools. This paper describes research
   conducted at three inclusive STEM schools, one each at the elementary,
   middle, and high school level. We explored similarities and differences
   in cultural dimensions across the schools with specific attention to how
   these differentially influence teachers' perceptions and enactment of
   STEM curriculum and instruction across the elementary, middle, and high
   school levels. Our cross-case analysis revealed structural aspects
   (school vision, community partnerships, course scheduling, and testing
   pressures) as well as professional orientations (i.e., instructional
   practices, interdisciplinary collaboration, and teacher content
   knowledge) that appear particularly important to student learning
   experiences at each grade level. Navigating these factors of STEM school
   culture requires teachers to not only be knowledgeable but also to draw
   on a professional orientation that encourages collaboration and
   risk-taking. We discuss implications for teacher education and STEM
   school development.},

Abstract = {Mathematics teacher education aims to improve teachers' use of
   mathematical knowledge to support teaching and learning, an aspect of
   pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). In this study, we interviewed
   teachers to understand how they used mathematics to make sense of
   student solutions to proportional reasoning problems. The larger purpose
   was to find accurate ways of categorizing teachers' ability to do this
   vital aspect of teaching and thereby to inform assessment, teacher
   education, and professional development. We conjectured that teachers'
   PCK for proportional reasoning could be reliably described in terms of
   attention to quantitative meanings in story problem contexts and in
   terms of understanding naive forms of proportional reasoning. Instead,
   our findings reveal that individual teachers used a variety of means to
   make sense of (1) cognitively similar student solutions to different
   tasks and (2) mathematically related steps of a student solution within
   a single task. These findings illustrate the complexity of PCK for the
   topic of proportional reasoning and suggest the limits of what can be
   inferred about teacher knowledge from teachers' evaluations of student
   solutions. We discuss implications for teacher education and assessment.},

Abstract = {Estimating measurement uncertainties is important for experimental
   scientific work. However, this is very often neglected in school
   curricula and teaching practice, even though experimental work is seen
   as a fundamental part of teaching science. In order to call attention to
   the relevance of measurement uncertainties, we developed a comprehensive
   model that structures and describes all subject matter on measurement
   uncertainties relevant to secondary education (age 13-19 years). It
   consists of ten basic concepts categorized within the following four
   dimensions: (a) existence of uncertainties, (b) handling of
   uncertainties, (c) assessment of uncertainties, and (d) conclusiveness
   of uncertainties. The model was developed by reviewing the subject
   literature, constructing a model for university level, validating this
   model with 6 experts in metrology (the science of measurement), adapting
   the model to the target group, and validating the simplified model with
   108 science teachers. We present the model and its development by
   describing the dimensions and concepts and by giving examples. Thus, our
   work provides a base for developing and assessing instructions to teach
   the estimation of measurement uncertainties in secondary education.},

Abstract = {The concepts of randomness and variation are pervasive in science. The
   purpose of this study was to document how post-secondary life science
   students explain randomness and variation, infer relationships between
   their explanations, and ability to describe and identify appropriate and
   inappropriate variation, and determine if students can identify sources
   of variation. An instrument designed to test statistical concepts was
   administered to 282 college students from three universities, ranging
   from introductory non-science majors to science graduate students.
   Students readily distinguished between causes of variation. A na < ve
   no-pattern concept of randomness persisted from first-year non-science
   majors to senior-level science majors, contributing to incorrect
   responses on the variation instrument. Students' expressions of
   randomness were better predictors of performance on the variation
   instrument than their expressions of variation. It is argued that
   inclusion of everyday language uses of randomness in instruction can
   bridge the gap between vernacular and scientific uses of this term.},

Title = {`Named Small but Doing Great': An Investigation of Small-Scale Chemistry
   Experimentation for Effective Undergraduate Practical Work},

Abstract = {In theory, practical work is an established part of university-level
   chemistry courses. However, mainly due to budget constraints, large
   class size, time constraints and inadequate teacher preparations,
   practical activities are frequently left out from chemistry classroom
   instruction in most developing countries. Small-scale chemistry (SSC)
   experimentation in which one uses miniature chemical equipment can
   drastically reduce quantities of chemicals used during experimentation,
   which can help overcome some of the barriers preventing practical work
   in the chemistry classroom. This study evaluated the effectiveness of
   using miniature chemical equipment at the undergraduate level in
   increasing students' understanding of chemistry concepts as well as in
   improving their attitude towards chemistry practical work. Two
   comparable groups of first-year students who enrolled for a Practical
   General Chemistry course participated. A quasi-experimental design was
   employed in which the experimental group (N = 49) used the SSC approach
   while the control group (N = 52) followed the traditional approach for
   over 8 weeks. Data were gathered using chemistry tests, attitude and
   perception questionnaires and interviews. Findings showed that the SSC
   approach was as effective as the traditional laboratory approach in
   improving students' attitude towards practical work, but more effective
   in enhancing students' understanding of chemistry concepts. More
   interestingly, SSC was positively accepted by both students and
   instructors as an effective strategy for teaching first-year
   undergraduate chemistry practicals. Some shortcomings of the approach
   were also identified.},

Title = {THE KNOWLEDGE BASE OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN TEACHING: A CASE STUDY
   OF A PROFESSIONAL SCIENTIST AS A BEGINNING TEACHER},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {One method of addressing the shortage of science and mathematics
   teachers is to train scientists and other science-related professionals
   to become teachers. Advocates argue that as discipline experts these
   career changers can relate the subject matter knowledge to various
   contexts and applications in teaching. In this paper, through interviews
   and classroom observations with a former scientist and her students, we
   examine how one career changer used her expertise in microbiology to
   teach microscopy. These data provided the basis for a description of the
   teacher's instruction which was then analysed for components of domain
   knowledge for teaching. Consistent with the literature, the findings
   revealed that this career changer needed to develop her pedagogical
   knowledge. However, an interesting finding was that the teacher's
   subject matter as a science teacher differed substantively from her
   knowledge as a scientist. This finding challenges the assumption that
   subject matter is readily transferable across professions and provides
   insight into how to better prepare and support career changers to
   transition from scientist to science teacher.},

Abstract = {International comparisons reveal that lower-secondary-level students in
   Austria perform below the OECD mean in science. Guided by the search for
   remedies and improvements in science teaching, this study investigates
   whether cross-age peer tutoring is an appropriate method for teaching
   physics. A modern and concise definition of peer tutoring is available
   from the review of previous findings which focus on tutors as well as on
   tutees. This clarification leads to an experimental setup mostly in
   tutor-tutee dyads where a sample of n = 172 students from grades 5 to 8
   underwent a cross-age peer tutoring process dealing with different
   topics within the context of electricity. The overall achievement in
   electricity for this age group was examined in a pretest-posttest
   design, using test items about electricity. Additionally, analyses were
   carried out in order to investigate whether or not there is a
   correlation between the possible roles within the process (active
   tutors-passive tutees) and the overall achievement. The results indicate
   that the active role is a crucial one for the achievement. Finally, a
   multiple linear regression model is presented which summarizes the
   research results and estimates the posttest scores based on the relevant

Abstract = {This study investigates how the illustrations in a science textbook,
   with their design modified according to cognitive process principles,
   affected students' learning performance. The quasi-experimental design
   recruited two Grade 5 groups (N = 58) as the research participants. The
   treatment group (n = 30) used the modified version of the textbook, and
   the comparison group (n = 28) used the standard textbook published in
   Taiwan. Scores from a researcher-developed performance assessment for
   the two groups were examined with a one-way ANCOVA, using the first unit
   examination as the covariate. Results showed that the modified textbook
   with a cognitive principles-driven design enhanced the participants'
   learning performance in terms of conceptual knowledge, as well as
   transfer and retention, compared with that of the group using the
   standard textbook. However, such improvement did not occur in procedural
   knowledge. Thus, the learning benefits of cognitive principles-driven
   illustrations warrant further investigation.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates the internal structure of professional
   vision of in-service teachers and student teachers with respect to
   classroom management and learning support in primary science lessons.
   Classroom management (including monitoring, managing momentum, and rules
   and routines) and learning support (including cognitive activation and
   structuring of content) are important dimensions of instructional
   quality. While classroom management is considered as a mainly
   noncontent-specific aspect of instructional quality, learning support in
   science classrooms is content-specific. The aim of the current study was
   to investigate whether professional vision is a general ability of
   teachers, or a two-dimensional ability which depends on the specific
   focus of instructional quality considered. In a sample of both 241
   German student teachers from different universities and in-service
   teachers from primary science classes, two video-based instruments were
   used for assessing professional vision of classroom management and
   professional vision of learning support. A structural equation model
   revealed a two-dimensional structure with a high correlation between
   professional vision of classroom management and of learning support.},

Title = {STUDENTS' SOURCES OF MOTIVATION FOR PARTICIPATING IN SCIENCE FAIRS: AN

Abstract = {Science fairs have been for many years a popular school activity in
   North America. They are a venue for the popularization of science and
   consequently an important encouragement for the pursuit of careers in
   science or engineering. However, little is known about students'
   perceived motives for participating in local or national science fairs
   and about the way in which their involvement mediates their interest in
   science learning and scientific careers. The present study investigates
   the motivational factors associated with the high school students'
   decision to participate in the 2008 Canada-Wide Science Fair, a
   thoroughly selected and highly motivated group. Our study examines 5
   sources of motivation: (1) interest in science content, (2) sense of
   self-efficacy, (3) assurance of achievement through rewards or
   gratifications, (4) the social aspect of participating and (5) working
   strategies to gain scientific knowledge and methods. The understanding
   of the anticipated benefits participants seek through their involvement
   in science fairs may have the potential to help science teachers adapt
   instruction to appeal to a broader range of students in schools, thus
   nourishing the emergence of more interest in science.},

Abstract = {Teaching method is a major factor that affects students' motivation to
   learn physics. This study investigated the effects of using mastery
   learning approach (MLA) on secondary school students' motivation to
   learn physics. Solomon four non-equivalent control group design under
   the quasi-experimental research method was used in which a random sample
   of 4 co-educational secondary schools was obtained in Kieni East
   Division of Nyeri District in Kenya. The 4 schools were randomly put
   into 4 groups. Each school provided 1 Form Two class for the study;
   hence, a total of 161 students were involved. The students were taught
   the same physics content. In the experimental groups, MLA teaching
   method was used while the regular teaching method was used in the
   control groups. The researchers trained the teachers in the experimental
   groups on the technique of MLA before the treatment. Two groups were
   pre-tested prior to the implementation of the MLA treatment. At the end
   of treatment period, all the 4 groups were post-tested using a validated
   Students' Motivation Questionnaire, whose reliability coefficient was
   0.76. Data were analysed using the t test, analysis of variance and
   analysis of covariance. The results of the study show that students
   exposed to MLA have significantly higher motivation than those taught
   through regular methods. Gender has no significant influence on their
   motivation to learn physics. The researchers conclude that MLA is an
   effective teaching method in motivating students; hence, physics
   teachers should incorporate it in teaching.},

Abstract = {The importance of research on misconceptions about chemical equilibrium
   is well recognized by educators, but in the past, researchers' interest
   has centered on student misconceptions and has neglected teacher
   misconceptions. Focusing on the effects of adding more reactants or
   products on chemical equilibrium, this article discusses the various
   misconceptions held by high school teachers. A misconception test was
   administered to two samples of chemistry teachers in Nanjing, China. Of
   the 109 teachers who participated in the test, only one understood that
   adding more CS2 gas to the equilibrium system CS2(g) + 4H(2)(g)
   reversible arrow CH4(g) + 2H(2)S(g) at constant pressure and temperature
   can shift the equilibrium to the reactant or product side, depending
   upon the amount of CS2 in the initial equilibrium system. Most of the
   teachers relied on Le Chatelier's principle and thus made erroneous
   predictions. The misconception test also revealed that those teachers
   who managed to compute equilibrium constants had a limited conceptual
   understanding of chemical equilibrium. Implications of these findings
   for teacher education and chemistry curriculum development are
   discussed.},

   theory. A multicase study design was utilized for the research in order
   to focus on a belief-practice relationship within several examples.
   Semistructured interviews, observations, and preservice teachers'
   written documents were used to collect data. Results showed that most
   preservice teachers held instructional beliefs aligned with
   constructivist philosophy. Some of the preservice teachers' beliefs were
   consistent with their practices while some of them presented different
   practices from their beliefs in different placements.},

Title = {Collective pedagogical content knowledge for teaching sustainable
   development},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 4},
Abstract = {It is vital that upper secondary students gain a rich and deep knowledge
   of sustainability issues, as they will enter adulthood and working life
   within a short time. The students belong to a generation that will be
   intensely involved in managing several environmental issues to achieve
   sustainable development for our Earth. However, earlier research
   indicates that many teachers have a low self-efficacy for teaching
   sustainability issues. This study aimed to explore how science teacher
   teams in Swedish upper secondary schools can develop their knowledge and
   expertise in sustainable development (SD) through collective reflections
   with the support of the reflective tool Content Representation (CoRe).
   Science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) development in
   teaching SD was examined. Twelve in-service science teachers
   participated in the study. The qualitative research design included
   semi-structured interviews and science teacher teams' collective
   meetings. The findings covered four themes about how the collective
   reflections with support of the CoRe tool stimulated teachers' PCK
   development: (1) creating structure and a focus for learning
   conversations, (2) modification of the teaching approach, (3)
   development of new content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge in SD,
   and (4) shared language to stimulate equal opportunities for students to
   learn SD. The conclusion is that with the support of CoRe, the teacher
   team's collective PCK in SD was developed; therefore, we recommend that
   decision-makers within the school system organize regular meetings in
   science teacher teams and introduce CoRe to the teachers.},

Title = {Polygon Class Learning Opportunities: Interplay Between Teacher's Moves,
   Children's Geometrical Thinking, and Geometrical Task},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 28},
Abstract = {This study identifies characteristics of polygon class learning
   opportunities for 8-9-year-old children during the whole-class
   instruction. We consider the interplay between the geometrical tasks
   demanding different ways of reasoning, features of children's
   geometrical thinking, and the teacher's moves to identify
   characteristics of learning opportunities. We identified 3 types of
   learning opportunities during whole-class instruction: (a) recognizing
   (initiating the deconstruction dimensional), (b) supporting children's
   analytical reasoning, and (c) encouraging children to establish
   relations between attributes of the figures. Our findings highlight the
   holistic facet of the learning opportunities of geometry in primary
   education that connect the students' geometrical arguments generated by
   solving enriching geometrical tasks and the teacher's moves drawing on
   children's geometrical thinking during the whole-class instruction. We
   conjectured that weaving these 3 aspects together supported the
   emergence of relevant geometric learning opportunities for children.},

Abstract = {There are studies that examine the impact of undergraduate research
   experiences on students, often concluding that there are benefits to
   such experiences. Using social career cognitive theory, our research
   aims to add to the literature by examining the long-term effects,
   including career path and inclusion in research field, of an
   undergraduate student research program. This research study used student
   testimony gathered through interviews to examine the influence of
   participation in an undergraduate STEM research experience for college
   first-year students that has been in place at the university for 10
   years. Our main finding is that the influence of the experience on
   students' field of interest and future career aspirations solidified or
   changed the career paths of 19 out of 20 students, further corroborating
   the previous research about undergraduate research experiences as
   high-impact practices.},

Title = {Undergraduate Students' Profiles of Cognitive Load in Augmented
   Reality-Assisted Science Learning and Their Relation to Science Learning
   Self-efficacy and Behavior Patterns},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Research evidence indicated that a specific type of augmented
   reality-assisted (AR-assisted) science learning design or support might
   not suit or be effective for all students because students' cognitive
   load might differ according to their experiences and individual
   characteristics. Thus, this study aimed to identify undergraduate
   students' profiles of cognitive load in AR-assisted science learning and
   to examine the role of their distinct profiles in self-efficacy together
   with associated behavior patterns in science learning. After ensuring
   the validity and reliability of each measure, a latent profile analysis
   confirmed that 365 Chinese undergraduates carried diverse dimensions of
   cognitive load simultaneously. The latent profile analysis findings
   revealed four fundamental profiles: Low Engagement, Immersive, Dabbling,
   and Organized, characterized as carrying various respective cognitive
   loads. The multivariate analysis of variance findings revealed different
   levels of the six AR science learning self-efficacy dimensions across
   profiles. Low Engagement students displayed the lowest self-efficacy
   among all dimensions. Organized students recorded better conceptual
   understanding and higher-order cognitive skills than Dabbling ones.
   Students with the Immersive profile had the highest science learning
   self-efficacy. The lag sequential analysis results showed significant
   differences in behavior patterns among profiles. Among them, profiles
   with social interaction, test, and reviewing feedback behavior had a
   significantly higher score for self-efficacy than those patterns mainly
   based on test learning and resource visits. This finding provides a
   unified consideration of students' diverse profiles and can inform
   interventions for effective design of AR-assisted science learning to
   match appropriate strategies to facilitate the science learning effect.},

Abstract = {Energy literacy is critical for all undergraduate students, particularly
   for future teachers, as they will guide the next generation toward more
   just and equitable energy systems. Many pre-service teachers have funds
   of knowledge (FoK) about energy that can enhance critical thinking about
   energy systems and inequities. This qualitative study explored
   pre-service teachers' funds of knowledge in online discussions about
   energy. Our students (n = 38) were older than typical undergraduates
   (mean age = 28), and most (75\%) had transferred from community colleges
   prior to attending Arizona State University. These students were
   enrolled in an online Sustainability Science for Teachers course. We
   analyzed student assignments from a 3-week energy unit designed to
   elicit student perspectives on energy injustices and equitable energy
   solutions. Overall, we found that many students drew from rich life
   experiences in their video-based discussions. Students shared FoK in the
   following content areas: energy sources, energy impacts, agriculture,
   conservation, energy industry perspectives, and energy consumption.
   Three exemplary cases are included to illustrate how students conveyed
   their FoK throughout the energy unit. These students brought pluralistic
   perspectives to online Flipgrid discussions focused on energy
   inequities. In the discussion, we highlight the importance of
   integrating social justice topics when teaching about energy, to bring
   more relevance to energy education. We also describe how video-based
   discussion can be utilized to create more equitable and culturally
   responsive online learning environments.},

Abstract = {Integrating the nature of science (NOS) into textbooks is one of the
   challenges in science curricula. This case study assessed the issue
   based on a sample of high school biology textbooks in Mainland China. We
   quantitatively compared changes in the extent, quality, and distribution
   of NOS representations between 2004 and 2019 editions. Three main
   findings emerged: (i) NOS representations have improved in the 2019
   editions compared to the 2004 editions, with a 42\% increase in
   frequency and a score growth rate of 70\%. (ii) There was an imbalanced
   distribution of NOS aspects, focusing on `empirical' and `tentative'
   aspects and omitting `theory-laden', `myth of `the scientific method',
   `scientific theories', `scientific laws', and `social and cultural
   embeddedness in science aspects. All NOS aspects were heavily weighted
   towards the genetics theme. (iii) NOS in the 2019 editions is still
   addressed as it was in the 2004 editions, with unsolved aspects omitted
   yet again or addressed inadequately. These results constitute direct
   evidence for future textbook revisions.},

Abstract = {This study examined a cohort of middle school pre-service mathematics
   teachers' understanding of the rate of change as they engaged in a model
   development sequence. By adopting a design-based research perspective, a
   model development sequence on the concept of rate of change has been
   designed and implemented as part of a mathematical modeling course for
   pre-service teachers. The data were collected from twenty senior year
   middle school pre-service mathematics teachers (PSTs) through
   questionnaires, modeling activities, reflection papers, and
   semi-structured interviews. The data analysis showed that PSTs have
   difficulties conceptualizing the rate of change and conceiving it as a
   multiplicative comparison of changes in two covarying quantities. As
   they frequently employed its percentage interpretation, PSTs experienced
   additional difficulty conceiving the conventional meaning of rate of
   change in a population growth context. PSTs generally used motion
   context as a reference while explaining the rate of change in different
   non-motion contexts. In general, PSTs developed their conception of the
   additive rate of change throughout the model development sequence.
   However, for some PSTs, difficulty in ratio-based reasoning on the rate
   of change in different non-motion contexts prevailed. We provided some
   arguments concerning the teaching and learning of rate of change.},

Abstract = {This study investigated sixth-grade students' development of
   multidisciplinary models involving the integration of mathematics,
   science, and statistics, together with shared STEM practices.
   Mathematics and science featured a reciprocal relationship within the
   real-world context of tsunami inundation. Experimenting with water tubs
   comprising ``landmasses{''} and ``shore slopes{''} of varying angles,
   students explored how varying the slope of the shoreline affects the
   inundation distance. Given that organising and structuring data are
   essential to the creation of models as systems of representation,
   students' modelling revealed a basic understanding of key statistical
   concepts and processes, including variation and covariation, and an
   ability to identify trends both within and across data sets. Students
   were able to apply their learning in recommending ways of minimising the
   impact of a real-world tsunami, demonstrating how such an investigation
   can facilitate understanding of natural phenomena. The overall findings
   indicate how elementary-grade students can successfully engage in
   independent multidisciplinary modelling within integrated STEM
   investigations and develop important conceptual understandings in the
   process.},

Abstract = {This article reports on an exploratory study of the shifts of teachers'
   interactions with boys from their first to their second year of using
   cognitively guided instruction (CGI) in their math instruction.
   Interaction analysis was used to analyze 22 videos, two per each of 11
   teachers, who applied CGI instruction in their classrooms (a) after
   participating in a CGI professional development program (year 1) and (b)
   after practicing CGI for one year (year 2). In the eleven year 1 videos,
   some teachers differentiated their attention to boys and girls based on
   two kinds of interactions: (a) during one-to-one interactions, teachers
   tended to distribute their attention more to boys as compared to girls;
   often, that attention was unevenly distributed among boys with some boys
   receiving more attention than others; and (b) during whole group
   interactions, teachers tended to ask more boys than girls to share their
   strategies. In the eleven year 2 videos, some noticeable shifts
   occurred: (a) during one-to-one interactions, teachers tended to
   distribute their attention to boys and girls and among students in more
   balanced patterns than during the previous year; and (b) during whole
   group interactions, teachers tended to balance how often they called on
   boys and girls to share. Microanalysis of selected episodes suggests
   that both shifts coincided with teachers' adapting their teaching to be
   more aligned with CGI principles of instruction, such as attending to
   students' mathematical thinking processes.},

Abstract = {This cross-national study examined students' evaluation of strategies
   for solving linear equations, as well as the extent to which their
   evaluation criteria were related to their use of strategies and/or
   aligned with experts' views about which strategy is the best. A total of
   792 middle school and high school students from Sweden, Finland, and
   Spain participated in the study. Students were asked to solve twelve
   equations, provide multiple solving strategies for each equation, and
   select the best strategy among those they produced for each equation.
   Our results indicate that students' evaluation of strategies was not
   strongly related to their initial preferences for using strategies.
   Instead, many students' criteria were aligned with the flexibility
   goals, in that a strategy that takes advantages of task context was more
   highly valued than a standard algorithm. However, cross-national
   differences in strategy evaluation indicated that Swedish and Finnish
   students were more aligned with flexibility goals in terms of their
   strategy evaluation criteria, while Spanish students tended to consider
   standard algorithms better than other strategies. We also found that
   high school students showed more flexibility concerns than middle school
   students. Different emphases in educational practice and prior knowledge
   might explain these cross-national differences as well as the findings
   of developmental changes in students' evaluation criteria.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of flipped classroom approaches can be improved by
   combining it with other pedagogical models such as inquiry-based
   learning. Implementing inquiry-based learning in flipped classroom
   scenarios requires teachers to plan arrangements for in- and
   out-of-class activities carefully. In this study, a design heuristic
   based on the 5E inquiry model was developed to support teachers'
   practice of planning inquiry-based flipped classroom lessons. Following
   a design-based research approach, the design heuristic progressed
   through two cycles within 2 years. The design heuristic was implemented
   in both cycles in an online professional development course for
   secondary mathematics teachers. In the first cycle, 18 lesson plans were
   collected and analysed using the 5E lesson plan scoring instrument.
   Results showed that the design heuristic helped teachers to set up
   lesson plans for flipped classroom scenarios which were mostly in line
   with the 5E model. However, the evaluation phase was insufficiently
   addressed. Revision decisions were made at the end of the first cycle,
   and the design heuristic was revised and re-implemented in a second
   cycle. Results of the second cycle showed another 19 participating
   teachers who also struggled in choosing appropriate assessment
   techniques, an issue which could not be resolved with the proposed
   design heuristic. This paper describes the development of the design
   heuristic as well as relevant design principles for inquiry-based
   flipped classroom scenarios. The proposed design heuristic is not domain
   specific. Hence, further research could examine its use in other
   subjects or interdisciplinary as inquiry-based flipped classroom
   approaches are one of the emerging pedagogies.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the research status of mathematical problem posing
   in thirteen major mathematics education journals from each journal's
   earliest publication year the study could access to the year of 2018 or
   2019, among which 49 years long was the longest and 14 years long was
   the shortest. After a systematic and comprehensive review of all the
   journal publications, a total of 62 articles on mathematical problem
   posing were analyzed in the study. It was found that empirical research
   constituted the majority of the studies; teachers were the largest
   research sample group; the research issue of teaching and teacher
   education was devoted to most frequently; most of the research issues
   preferred the qualitative research type, posing questions for a problem
   situation was the most popular type of problem posing task of empirical
   research articles; and each research sample group was presented each
   type of problem posing tasks in different frequencies. Implications for
   research were derived from the results of research types, research
   sample groups, research issues, and types of problem posing tasks. The
   current research status and future research perspectives of mathematical
   problem posing were accordingly proposed in the study.},

Abstract = {Inquiry-based learning (IBL) emphasizes learning through experiencing
   and constructing. Where IBL is often applied in science education, the
   conceptualization of IBL practices in mathematics education is less
   obvious. We compared students' reports on IBL practices in two different
   teaching cultures as an attempt to better understand IBL practices in
   connection with overarching teaching cultures. In this study, we
   investigated IBL practices in lower-secondary mathematics lessons in the
   Beijing area and the Netherlands through a survey about the experiences
   and preferences of 858 Chinese students and 441 Dutch students. Results
   show that students from the Beijing sample reported experiencing IBL
   activities in most mathematics lessons, while students from the Dutch
   sample reported them in some lessons, and both preferred the same amount
   of IBL activities as they experienced. The Dutch sample reported little
   experience with posing questions to tackle. The study also suggests a
   correlation between IBL experience and IBL preference of each class:
   students with more IBL experience are likely to show a higher preference
   for IBL activities. Results of this study do not confirm expectations
   based on stereotypes about the two teaching cultures. The students'
   perspective in both samples suggests that providing complex problems and
   organizing group work have potential for further encouraging IBL in
   mathematics.},

Abstract = {This study examines how grade 5 students engage with the aspects
   (construct and critique) of argument in an online asynchronous
   discussion combined with in-class wrap-up discussion. Grade 5 students
   in a rural public school engaged in a ``human health investigation{''}
   unit using an argument-based inquiry approach followed by online
   asynchronous discussions using a Moodle forum. The online discussion was
   wrapped up by a 1-h in-class discussion and student writing of claims,
   evidence, and reflection. Data sources included online notes posted by
   111 students in the Moodle forum, a video record of in-class discussion,
   and writing samples of claims, evidence, and reflections produced by 54
   students after online and in-class discussions. Results of this study
   indicate that students engaged with the construct and critique
   components of argument in the online asynchronous discussion and in the
   in-class wrap-up discussion. The results show that in terms of the
   argument components they (a) used evidence resources to challenge and
   supplement arguments, (b) critiqued and reinforced evidence, and (c)
   strongly negotiated and confirmed/revised claims.},

Abstract = {Although research on teachers' noticing in mathematics education has
   significantly increased over the last decade, little is known about the
   relationship between teachers' noticing and teachers' knowledge as an
   influential basis of their professional noticing. This paper examines
   this relationship based on a study involving 203 in-service Chinese
   mathematics teachers. The results suggest that the different components
   of teacher knowledge influence teacher noticing differently. Among
   others, the sub-facets of teachers' noticing, ``interpretation and
   decision-making,{''} have a stronger correlation with teachers'
   knowledge than the sub-facet ``perception.{''} However, due to social
   and cultural differences between Eastern and Western countries, the
   study did not identify strong connections, as expected from the results
   of studies carried out in Western countries. Instead, rather weak
   overall connections between mathematics teachers' knowledge and their
   noticing could be identified reflecting specific features of Chinese
   culture.},

Title = {The Representation of Global Issues in Taiwanese Elementary School
   Science Textbooks},

Abstract = {In today's heavily science-dependent global society, science education
   should be the key to learners more fully grasping global issues. A
   content analysis of 24 elementary school science textbooks in Taiwan was
   undertaken to examine how global issues were represented. The results
   revealed that about half of the content was related to global issues,
   yet it was limited to the conventional subject knowledge of science.
   Most of the related units covered environmental sustainability and
   global systems. Multiculturalism and human rights, social justice, and
   conflict prevention were seldom mentioned and lacked intellectual depth.
   In the temporal dimension, global issues in the related units were
   mainly presented as existing in the present period, while there was less
   emphasis placed on the future or the past. Regarding the spatial
   dimensions, global issues in the related units were mainly presented in
   the classroom and family contexts, rather than in the broader social or
   global context. To prepare our students for an inclusive and sustainable
   world, science textbooks should adopt a broader perspective to include
   more underrepresented global issues and expand the temporal and spatial
   dimensions to facilitate students' future thinking and public
   engagement. This study is the first step toward this goal with practical
   suggestions for front-line teachers and teacher trainers, and for
   developing science education materials that better represent global
   issues.},

Abstract = {We focus on teachers' ways of leading whole class discussions (WCDs) in
   mathematics, with the goal of uncovering their traces (if any) in their
   students' responses (a) while participating in the WCDs and (b) in the
   written responses in a final test. For this purpose, two 8th-grade
   probability classes learning a 10-lesson unit with different teachers
   were observed. Our data sources include (1) video-recordings of the WCDs
   and (2) the responses of students to final test items. We analyzed the
   teachers' talk-moves, students' accountable participation, and students'
   reasoning in the final test items. Interweaving the findings from all
   analyses we found differences between the classes in students' ways of
   participation in WCDs and in their corresponding final test responses.
   The teachers' ways of leading the WCDs contribute to the explanation of
   these differences.},

Title = {Teacher Leaders' Mathematical Noticing: Eliciting and Analyzing},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {There is a growing knowledge base in mathematics education highlighting
   the importance of teachers' cognizance about what and how they are
   noticing, namely considerations about their attending, interpreting, and
   decisions to respond on the basis of students' thinking. However, less
   focus has centered on those in teacher leader positions and how those
   individuals may arrive at claims about students' thinking and use
   evidence to support their assertions, meaning how they notice. As a
   result, a process to engage teacher leaders in considering students'
   thinking was implemented for professional growth for those who support
   mathematics teachers. Findings highlight the degree of specificity of
   the teacher leaders' noticing, the origin of the evidence they cite, and
   their connection between claims about students' mathematical thinking,
   evidence, and broader implications for teaching and learning. Most
   teacher leaders included limited or robust evidence, with a majority
   citing transcript quotes as evidence for their claims about student
   thinking. Most teacher leaders were noticing at a mixed (Level 2) or
   focused (Level 3) level, based on a four-point scale. Implications for
   those working with mathematics teachers or teacher leaders to support
   the development of noticing and how to cite evidence are provided.},

Abstract = {Numbers and operations is widely considered the most essential domain in
   elementary school grades. Nevertheless, elementary students in Indonesia
   have consistently performed unsatisfactorily on this domain in several
   international mathematics assessments. This study examined 308
   Indonesian sixth grade students' current performance(s),
   misconception(s), and confidence level(s) on a three-tier test
   containing 40 number sense-related questions. The results showed that
   most of the students performed unsatisfactorily (indicating low number
   sense) with a relatively high level of confidence and exhibited
   considerable misconceptions. The percentage of the correct responses
   (i.e. answers and reasons) was approximately 46.48\% for the 40
   questions. Specifically, only 25 students (8.12\%) had good number
   sense, while 60.71\% of the students held either strong or moderate
   misconceptions. The students' strong misconceptions were identified. In
   addition, other remarkable findings are presented and discussed.
   Furthermore, the implications of the results and the suggestions for
   future research are described.},

Abstract = {Mathematics teacher continuing professional development (CPD) is widely
   recognised to encompass more than attending courses and engaging in
   formal activities with colleagues in school. Teachers' professional
   reading is an under-researched aspect of CPD, which takes place out of
   view, but which has the potential to shape teachers' beliefs and
   practices. Mathematics teacher professional journals are relatively
   widely read by teachers and are a source of articles on a range of
   issues concerning the teaching and learning of mathematics. Such
   articles will to some extent reflect the interests of mathematics
   teachers and play a role in informing their teaching, thus indirectly
   affecting students' experiences in the classroom. But what topics do the
   articles in these journals focus on, and how has this changed over time?
   In this study, we examined the entire archive of the two leading UK
   mathematics teacher professional journals (Mathematics Teaching and
   Mathematics in School, published since 1957 and 1971, respectively; in
   total, almost 15 million words). We found an increasing prevalence over
   time of articles about classroom activities and people-centred
   discussions and a decreasing prevalence of articles focusing on
   textbooks. We discuss these and other trends, offer tentative accounts
   for them and consider ways in which the beliefs and practices of
   mathematics teachers may be reflected in, and have been informed by,
   these publications over time.},

Title = {How to Cultivate an Environmentally Responsible Maker? A CPS Approach to
   a Comprehensive Maker Education Model},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Environmental education is intended to increase public awareness and
   knowledge about environmental issues and enhance individuals'
   problem-solving and decision-making skills by tackling problems in the
   real world. ``Maker education,{''} on the contrary, mostly relies on
   ``problem-based{''} and ``project-based learning{''} approaches with
   hands-on activities and collaborative learning experiences to engage
   students in solving authentic problems. The current study proposes an
   innovative curriculum design to integrate maker-centered learning with
   environmental thematic teaching. It then develops a series of
   project-based maker-centered learning activities aspiring to lead
   students to cultivate their creative problem solving (CPS) abilities in
   dealing with the environmental issues they encounter in their daily
   life. The developed information platform enables learners to access
   class materials and techniques, including 3D modeling, printing, and
   programming, to provide and nurture learners' CPS abilities, and
   facilitates their information-, product-, and resource sharing. This
   study adopted a quasi-experimental design, and the developed curriculum
   was implemented in the teaching of two classes of a university in Taiwan
   (N = 73). Multiple scales were developed and applied to measure maker
   self-efficacy and environmental attitude to determine students' learning
   outcomes. In conclusion, the study provided empirical evidence of how to
   design an effective maker-centered environmental curriculum to cultivate
   environmental awareness and attitude. Also, it provides a framework, a
   ``comprehensive maker education model,{''} to develop better teaching
   and learning strategies and improve the effectiveness of a maker
   curriculum in higher education.},

Title = {Teachers' Use of Focus Questions in German Biology Classrooms: a

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of teachers' use of focus questions
   on students' knowledge structures and classroom teaching-learning
   process by re-analyzing selected data from a quasi-experimental pre-post
   video study (Wadouh, 2007). Focus questions are content-related
   anchoring questions highlighting the key content taught in individual
   lessons (Forbes \& Davis, 2010). In Wadouh' study, students answered a
   knowledge test before and after the lesson on blood and the circulatory
   system and one lesson per teacher was videotaped to investigate teaching
   practices in grade 9 biology classrooms. Students also completed a
   post-unit concept mapping exercise and a motivation-interest
   questionnaire. In this study, 30 lesson videos selected from 47 were
   re-analyzed for teachers' use of focus questionsno focus questions,
   non-specific or simple focus questions, and specific and challenging
   focus questions. Individual students' scores in the concept mapping
   exercise were aggregated as students' topic-related knowledge structure.
   Multilevel analyses revealed a significant positive effect of teachers'
   use of specific and challenging focus questions on students'
   topic-related knowledge structure. Furthermore, a comparative case
   analysis of the classroom teaching-learning process was conducted in
   four lessons where teachers used specific and challenging focus
   questions in two of the lessons and non-specific or simple focus
   questions in the other two lessons. The findings indicate that specific
   and challenging focus questions anchored lessons on students'
   co-construction of scientific explanations by activating their
   pre-instructional ideas, whereas non-specific or simple focus questions
   anchored lessons on their accumulation of canonical scientific
   knowledge. This study's limitations and implications for teacher
   education reform are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study, we have synthesized the research on visualization and
   representation to propose a model consisting of 4 major components of
   visualization competence in learning science: constructing,
   interpreting, transforming, and critiquing visualizations. We have
   developed and validated an assessment that measures students'
   visualization competence of matter (VCM). We administered the VCM
   assessment to 762 7th to 12th grade students at 2 public high schools in
   Taiwan. The students had started to learn concepts of matter at the
   particulate level in the 7th grade. However, traditional assessments
   rarely measure students' visualization competence in science. It was
   therefore unclear how well the students performed on visualization of
   matter across grade levels. Overall, the results indicated that the
   students' visualization competence of matter improved as they advanced
   to higher grades. A significant factor accounting for the development of
   their visualization competence of matter is their course experience, not
   their age or gender. We also found that content knowledge plays only a
   conditional role in students developing visualization competence of that
   content. Implications and future studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {International surveys repeatedly showed that Japanese children were good
   at mathematics but disliking it. We hypothesized there were a
   considerable number of ``fake math-dislikes{''} among Japanese students
   who claimed they disliked mathematics explicitly but accepted it
   implicitly. To examine this hypothesis, we administered questionnaires
   and paper-based implicit association tests (IAT) to 204 Japanese junior
   high school students (13-14 years old) and found 38 fake math-dislikes
   (Study 1). We hypothesized further that those fake math-dislikes would
   become real math-dislikes eventually and that informing of their
   implicit attitude toward mathematics might work preventing this
   undesirable transition. Then, in Study 2, we randomly assigned them into
   experimental and control groups and informed only the experimental
   students of their positive implicit attitude toward mathematics we
   revealed with the IAT. One year later, we found 15 of the 16
   experimental students improved their math achievement scores while only
   9 of the 17 control students did. The simple practice of informing of
   their implicit attitude worked effectively for improving their math
   achievement. As hypothesized, it prevented the fake math-dislike
   students from turning into real math-dislikes.},

Abstract = {The boom in Internet and communication technology has accelerated change
   in information delivery channels from paper to networked, digital
   displaying devices. Reading electronically has altered the cognitive and
   metacognitive processes readers use to approach science texts. Assessing
   reading in a digitized environment also opens up opportunities to
   examine the recursive process of self-regulated learning. However, a
   systematic analysis in this area across paper- and e-based environments
   is lacking. This study explores methods of assessing metacognition in
   reading informational science texts to address this gap. A total of 55
   studies in 47 articles published from 1990 to 2016 investigating effects
   of metacognition on science reading are reviewed. The analysis reveals
   frequently applied methods, including self-report questionnaires for
   measuring metacognitive knowledge, event-based assessment for
   metacognitive skills, and questionnaires or interviews for metacognitive
   experiences. Community acceptable instruments are presented and
   illustrated. E-based environment has potential to support comprehensive
   and complicated measurement of metacognition. Future research may
   further the investigation of interactions among metacognitive components
   by designing sequential tasks and combining multiple assessment methods.
   Finally, triangulation of findings from various methods is essential in
   assessing metacognition involved in self-regulated reading.},

Abstract = {Science communication, as a hybrid, involves the concomitant reading of
   graphical representations and natural language. A scientifically
   literate individual should be able to make sense of both sites of
   information in relation to one another. In this paper, we explore the
   ability of 61 students from a highly rated, all-girls Catholic School to
   make sense of inconsistent graphical and textual data and examine their
   interpretations within 3 distinct settings: individually on a paper
   assessment, in a one-to-one interview with the researchers, and through
   classroom conversation. This study indicates that (1) sense-making was
   difficult for even advanced students and (2) different interpretations
   of text evolved within each of the 3 settings. Many students initially
   privileged natural language over the data represented on the graph and
   sought ways to explain how the incorrect description could somehow be
   construed as accurate. Although these students could successfully
   complete school assignments related to graphs, their skills in reading
   authentic, real-world science communication was limited. We recommend
   that teachers invite discussion of various semiotic forms rather than
   scaffold for correctness. Students have learned to do schoolwork, but
   they are much less able to engage critically in real-world science.},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of middle and
   high school students from Asian countries participating in U.S.-based
   summer experiences (Perlez \& Gao, 2013). Although summer science camps
   have been shown to improve students' attitudes and interests related to
   science and science learning (Bhattacharyya, Mead \& Nathaniel, School
   Science and Mathematics 111:345-353, 2011; Fields, International Journal
   of Science Education 31:151-171, 2009; Gibson \& Chase, Science
   Education 86:693-705, 2002; Luehmann, International Journal of Science
   Education 31:1831-1855, 2009), whether there are cognitive gains for
   visiting students in these short-term experiences is not well understood
   (Liu \& Lederman, School Science and Mathematics 102:114-123, 2002;
   Williams, Ma, Prejean, Ford \& Lai, Journal of Research on Technology in
   Education 40:201-216, 2007). This study explored the efficacy of a U.S.
   summer science camp to engender improved understandings about scientific
   inquiry (SI) among a group of gifted Taiwanese students (n=19) in grades
   8 and 9. Participants were completing an 80-h summer science camp at a
   Midwestern U.S. university. The Views About Scientific Inquiry (VASI)
   questionnaire (Lederman, Lederman, Bartos, Bartels, Antink Meyer \&
   Schwartz, Journal of Research in Science Teaching 51:65-83, 2014) was
   used to capture students' views before and after camp participation,
   with modest gains evident for five of the eight aspects of scientific
   inquiry assessed. These gains were related to scientific investigations
   beginning with a question, the multiple methods of science, the role of
   the question in guiding procedures, the distinction between data and
   evidence, and the combination of data and what is already known in the
   development of explanations. Implications for the structure of science
   camps for supporting the development of SI understandings among students
   from Asian classrooms, and in general, are discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore 15 graduate research
   assistants' understanding of the nature of science. Data were collected
   through administration of a modified version of the Views of Nature of
   Science Questionnaire (VNOS-C). The findings suggest that graduate
   research assistants held underdeveloped views related to several nature
   of science (NOS) aspects including the argumentative nature of science,
   the process of modeling in science, scientists' treatment of unexpected
   results, collaborative nature of science, and the process of theory
   formation. The discussion focuses on the missing link in preparation of
   future scientists and offers suggestions to address the learning needs
   of graduate research assistants regarding their understanding of NOS.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses different conceptual frameworks for measuring
   mathematics pedagogical content knowledge (MPCK) in international
   comparison studies. Two large-scale international comparative studies,
   Mathematics Teaching in the Twenty-First Century (MT21; Schmidt et al.,
   2011) and the Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics
   (TEDS-M; Tatto et al., 2012), were used for analysis. The challenges
   faced by these studies included the lack of elaborate conceptual
   frameworks for MPCK developed by non-Western scholars and the
   corresponding test items that were tied to the frameworks. In this
   paper, I introduce a conceptual framework developed by Hsieh (Secondary
   Education, 63(3), 30-47, (2012) in Taiwan relating to MPCK. The items of
   the 2 international comparison studies were reexamined according to
   Hsieh's model. A study based on Hsieh's model is introduced to manifest
   the existence of distinct or probably conflicting ideas between
   Taiwanese and Western countries regarding the scope and substance of
   different types of mathematics teachers' knowledge. Hsieh's model is a
   start toward searching for an East Asian identity in MPCK.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to explore the long-term outcomes of
   either participating or not participating in early childhood science
   education on grade 6 students' conceptual understanding of science. The
   research is situated in a conceptual framework that evokes Piagetian
   developmental levels as both potential curriculum constraints and
   potential models of efficacy. The research design was a multiple case
   study of grade 6 children from 3 schools in China (n = 140) who started
   formal science education in the third grade and grade 6 children from 3
   matched schools in Australia (n = 105) who started learning science in
   kindergarten. The students' understanding was assessed by a science quiz
   and an in-depth interview. The data showed that participating children
   from the high socioeconomic schools in China and Australia had similar
   understandings of science. Divergence between the medium and low
   socioeconomic schools, however, indicated that the grounding in early
   childhood science education in Australia may have placed these children
   at an advantage. Alternative explanations for the divergence, including
   the nature of classroom instruction in the two countries, are discussed.},

Abstract = {An understanding of geologic time is comprised of 2 facets. Events in
   Earth's history can be placed in relative and absolute temporal
   succession on a vast timescale. Rates of geologic processes vary widely,
   and some occur over time periods well outside human experience. Several
   factors likely contribute to an understanding of geologic time, one of
   which is an individual's ability to perceive the relative size of large
   time periods and to move multiplicatively through quantities that differ
   by many orders of magnitude. Thirty-five US students aged 13-24 years
   participated in task-based interviews to assess their understanding of
   large temporal periods. Fewer than half of the students performed well
   enough to indicate that their knowledge of large numbers was robust
   enough to enable them to understand processes in geologic time. Some
   students were confused about relationships between quantities in the
   thousands and millions, while others had difficulty showing proportional
   relationships among relatively small temporal units (up to 100 years).
   Students differed in their ability to perceive the entire scale upon
   which numbers were to be placed as well as broader problem-solving
   strategies. Spatial mapping of numbers was evident. Implications for
   future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Nine prospective secondary mathematics teachers were interviewed about
   their teaching internship experience. The results of these interviews
   revealed that 7 of the 9 participants professed to value reform-oriented
   teaching and conceptual understanding in mathematics, yet all were
   paired with cooperating teachers who seemed to value traditional
   instruction and procedural understanding in mathematics. We explored the
   reasons that some of these student interns had positive experiences with
   their cooperating teachers and university supervisors while others had
   negative experiences. We found that the participants valued (a) critical
   feedback that was constructive and contained concrete recommendations
   for improvement, (b) freedom to use their own teaching methods, and (c)
   a friendly and supportive relationship with their mentors. The differing
   teaching philosophies of student teachers and their cooperating teachers
   contributed to negative experiences only when student teachers were not
   allowed freedom in their teaching methods.},

Title = {PUTTING CONTEXT IN CONTEXT: AN EXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE FOR THE
   BENEFITS OF `CONTEXTUALISED' TASKS},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {367-390},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The professional literature in mathematics education is replete with
   calls to use tasks that are `authentic', `relevant' and related to `real
   life' and the `real world'. Such activities are frequently advocated for
   their potential to motivate and engage students, but evidence of their
   ability to do so is rarely presented. This paper examines evidence in
   relation to the effectiveness of context problems in achieving their
   intended purposes and thereby contributing to enhanced student
   participation, engagement and achievement in mathematics education. It
   is argued that context problems are not a panacea and that categorising
   problems as contextualised or de-contextualised is less helpful than the
   consideration of more salient aspects of tasks that impact on their
   effectiveness. Such aspects also relate to the purposes for and
   affordances and limitations of particular tasks in relation to the
   purposes they are intended to serve, along with attention to the
   contexts in which students learn mathematics. Examples of theoretical
   and empirical programs built on these considerations are reviewed in
   terms of their potential to enhance participation, engagement and
   achievement in school mathematics.},

Abstract = {Images, diagrams, and other forms of visualization are playing
   increasingly important roles in molecular life science teaching and
   research, both for conveying information and as conceptual tools,
   transforming the way we think about the events and processes the subject
   covers. This study examines how upper secondary and tertiary students
   interpret visualizations of transport through the cell membrane in the
   form of a still image and an animation. Twenty upper secondary and five
   tertiary students were interviewed. In addition, 31 university students
   participated in a group discussion and answered a questionnaire
   regarding the animation. A model, based on variation theory, was then
   tested as a tool for distinguishing between what is expected to be
   learned, what is present in the visualizations, and what is actually
   learned by the students. Three critical features of the ability to
   visualize biomolecular processes were identified from the students'
   interpretations of the animation: the complexity of biomolecular
   processes, the dynamic and random nature of biomolecular interactions,
   and extrapolation between 2D and 3D. The results of this study support
   the use of multiple representations to achieve different learning goals.},

Title = {The Evolution from ``I think it plus three{''} Towards ``I think it is
   always plus three.{''} Transition from Arithmetic Generalization to
   Algebraic Generalization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 12},
Abstract = {This paper is part of broader research being conducted in the area of
   algebraic thinking in primary education. Our general research objective
   was to identify and describe generalization of a 2nd grade student (aged
   7-8). Specifically, we focused on the transition from arithmetic to
   algebraic generalization. The notion of structure and its continuity in
   the generalization process are important for this transition. We are
   presenting a case study with a semi-structured interview where we
   proposed a task of contextualized generalization involving the function
   y = x + 3. Special attention was given to the structures evidenced and
   the type of generalization expressed by the student in the process. We
   noted that the student identified the correct structure for the task
   during the interview and that he evidenced a factual type of algebraic
   generalization. Due to the student's identification of the appropriate
   structure and the application of it to other different particular cases,
   we have observed a transition from arithmetic thinking to algebraic
   thinking.},

Abstract = {This study investigated gender disparities in students' science
   motivational beliefs, conceptualized as self-concept and intrinsic
   value, from Grades 4 to 8 in 22 countries. The gender-specific relation
   between science motivational beliefs and achievement was also
   scrutinized. Data from the 2011 and 2015 national cohorts of the Trends
   in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) were explored.
   The t test and effect size results indicated gender gaps in self-concept
   and intrinsic value at the two grade levels. Boys' motivational beliefs
   were stronger than girls' in Grade 8 in the majority of countries, but
   the pattern in Grade 4 varied across countries. The relatively high
   science motivational beliefs among girls in Middle Eastern countries are
   extensively discussed from sociocultural perspectives. A downward trend
   of science motivational beliefs over grade levels occurred in all
   countries, and the degree to which girls' motivational beliefs decreased
   was greater than the decrease for boys in most of the countries.
   Moreover, the regression modeling results showed that boys' self-concept
   and intrinsic value accounted more for their science achievement than
   did girls' in both grades. Students' self-concept was a stronger
   predictor than intrinsic value of achievement, regardless of gender. The
   findings provide empirical evidence from multiple countries of the
   development trends of science motivational beliefs, with gender as the
   focus.},

Title = {High School and Preservice Chemistry Teacher Education Students'
   Understanding of Voltaic and Electrolytic Cell Concepts: Evidence of
   Consistent Learning Difficulties Across Years},

Abstract = {High school students learn the basic voltaic and electrolytic cell
   concepts during their last year prior to entering an undergraduate
   teacher-education science degree. During the 4 years of university,
   students complete a sequence of topics designed to build on conceptual
   understanding presented in previous years. At the end of their degrees,
   graduating students are expected to have developed a comprehensive
   understanding of the subject that they are required to teach. In this
   research, we designed and developed a 12-item diagnostic instrument
   which addressed 10 propositional content knowledge statements based on
   the grade 12 chemistry curriculum that will be taught. In this
   cross-section study, 50 grade 12 high school students and 216 preservice
   chemistry teacher education undergraduates in years 1-4 responded to the
   Electrochemistry Conceptual Test (ECT) consisting of 12 two-tier
   multiple-choice items. The instrument was content validated by authors
   and peers prior to administration and when implemented had a Cronbach
   alpha reliability coefficient of 0.64. Overall, the students across
   years possessed basic knowledge about electrochemical cells but
   frequently were unable to explain their knowledge. While the grand mean
   trend in understanding electrochemistry concepts from high school
   through university study did show some improvement, the mean scores
   remained relatively low, and the year group means per item showed no
   such trend exacerbated by items having varying levels of difficulty.
   Based on this research, the lack in understanding about electrochemical
   concepts suggests that instruction in high school and ongoing university
   chemistry education faces ongoing challenges.},

Title = {Implementing Confidence Assessment in Low-Stakes, Formative Mathematics
   Assessments},

Abstract = {Confidence assessment (CA) involves students stating alongside each of
   their answers a confidence rating (e.g. 0 low to 10 high) to express how
   certain they are that their answer is correct. Each student's score is
   calculated as the sum of the confidence ratings on the items that they
   answered correctly, minus the sum of the confidence ratings on the items
   that they answered incorrectly; this scoring system is designed to
   incentivize students to give truthful confidence ratings. Previous
   research found that secondary-school mathematics students readily
   understood the negative-marking feature of a CA instrument used during
   one lesson, and that they were generally positive about the CA approach.
   This paper reports on a quasi-experimental trial of CA in four
   secondary-school mathematics lessons (N = 475 students) across time
   periods ranging from 3 weeks up to one academic year, compared to
   business-as-usual controls. A meta-analysis of the effect sizes across
   the four schools gave an aggregated Cohen's d of -0.02 {[}95\% CI -0.22,
   0.19] and an overall Bayes Factor B-01 of 8.48. This indicated
   substantial evidence for the null hypothesis that there was no
   difference between the attainment gains of the intervention group and
   the control group, relative to the alternative hypothesis that the gains
   were different. I conclude that incorporating confidence assessment into
   low-stakes classroom mathematics formative assessments does not appear
   to be detrimental to students' attainment, and I suggest reasons why a
   clear positive outcome was not obtained.},

Abstract = {The world is facing severe global challenges such as climate change,
   food security, rising migration, social justice, or the current corona
   crisis. In these times, citizenship education seems more important than
   ever. How can this citizenship education relate to mathematics and
   science learning? The research project MaSDiV (Supporting mathematics
   and science teachers in addressing diversity and promoting fundamental
   values) connected mathematics and science with citizenship education by
   modeling real-life problems relevant to society. In this paper, we
   present the foundational design features of the PD course as well the
   results from the accompanying evaluation of this PD course, which was
   implemented by partners in six countries to support teachers in
   connecting mathematics and science education with citizenship education.
   More specifically, we investigate how participating teachers experienced
   the PD program; how their self-efficacy beliefs, learning-related
   beliefs, as well as teaching practices change; and which factors
   contributed to that change. In order to investigate the outcome of the
   PD program, we surveyed N = 311 mathematics and science teachers' pre-
   and post-participation of the PD in six different European countries.
   Among others, our results show that in general, most participating
   teachers reported a high overall satisfaction with the course across all
   six participating countries. They also indicate that teachers'
   self-efficacy beliefs about using relevant contexts, their
   learning-related beliefs about the benefits of using contexts, as well
   as their own teaching practice changed significantly after participating
   in the MaSDiV PD course.},

Abstract = {Science writing is a complex rhetorical activity that enhances
   disciplinary participation in university education and requires
   learner-centered, inquiry-based explicit instruction. This study aimed
   to determine the effects of teaching writing self-assessment of
   scientific posters on writing quality and academic achievement in a
   higher education science class. An interdisciplinary team of science and
   writing scholars designed an action-research intervention based on two
   90-min workshops focused on students' self-assessment of writing
   scientific posters for a first-semester Cell Biology course for
   prospective teachers of biology and chemistry in secondary schools.
   Students co-created and applied a checklist to assess writing traits
   central to scientific communication (e.g. use of reliable references and
   original figures, inclusion of limitations and projections) in their
   posters. Promoted writing traits were qualitatively coded in
   double-blind fashion in posters from 19 teams with similar intakes: 9
   teams (45 students, 100\% population) in the treatment group and 10
   teams (50 randomly selected students, 50\% population) from two previous
   years. Principal component analysis (PCA) and permutation ANOVA were
   used to quantitatively determine divergence between groups. Results
   indicated that posters constructed by intervention-treated teams were
   significantly better in terms of the reliability and retrievability of
   sources; they also showed a higher number of student-made figures,
   projections and conclusions. In addition, evaluators' scores for posters
   increased in the treatment groups, although this did not have a
   significant impact on overall grades. These results offer empirical
   support of self-assessment for learning and the use of poster
   construction as effective pedagogical strategies in science teacher
   education.},

Abstract = {This study explored how teachers engage and support students at a
   project-based STEM high school to identify key elements defining
   students' learning experiences in a project-based environment.
   Interviews and surveys provided students' and teachers' perspectives of
   challenges and supports in the project-based learning process. The
   teachers' support was personal and caring, they challenged students and
   provided responsive guidance and advice, responding directly to
   students' interests while retaining high standards and expectations; we
   saw that teachers' caring in an environment of high expectations was
   crucial for student success. Identification of three critical elements
   of the teachers' supports and challenges (student-centered projects, a
   focus on twenty-first century competencies, and strong teacher-student
   relationships) led to recommendations for teacher preparation such as
   providing preservice teachers with authentic experiences, celebrating
   failure as part of learning, explicitly teaching about project-based
   learning pedagogy, and stressing the importance of caring relationships
   and twenty-first century competencies.},

Abstract = {This article shares findings from a study conducted in the southeastern
   United States of the impact of a teacher leadership course on upper
   elementary, middle, and high school mathematics and science teachers.
   Fifty-nine teachers completed the course and data analysis showed growth
   in understanding in five areas of teacher leadership. This growth was
   analyzed using a four-image teacher leadership conceptual framework.
   Data analysis revealed a fifth image of growth that more fully
   represented the teacher leadership development of the participating
   teachers. Details of specific teacher leader characteristics within each
   image are included and findings are presented addressing growth within
   each of the five images based on the course experience. Discussion is
   offered about the implications for mathematics and science teacher
   leader development derived from the data analysis.},

Abstract = {We report on a study focused on identifying how the notion of ``the
   mathematician{''} is constructed in lower secondary Mexican mathematics
   textbooks. To conduct the study, we adopted a Foucauldian approach that
   allows us to identify the way in which the notion of the mathematician
   is constructed but also to delineate the possible effects that such
   construction may have on students' subjectivities. Results show that the
   representations of mathematicians that most frequently appear in these
   textbooks are males, mainly Europeans, who lived in ancient times. The
   representations of female mathematicians are almost nil. We
   conceptualize the representations of mathematicians contained in these
   mathematics textbooks as part of a discourse that creates realities and
   constructs subjectivities, and suggest a theoretical explanation of the
   mechanisms that allow these representations to circulate and to be
   perpetuated.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate how the community-based socioscientific
   issues program (SSI-COMM) affected middle school students' sense of
   place (SOP) and character development as citizens. We designed and
   implemented SSI-COMM on fine dust, abandoned pets, and recycling issues
   that were closely related to the students' local communities. SSI-COMM
   consisted of four phases, and in each phase, students engaged in various
   activities both within and outside of school. A total of 441 seventh
   graders participated in SSI-COMM over 8 weeks. Two questionnaires were
   used to measure the changes in students' SOP and character development
   (CVGCA) through SSI-COMM. Paired t test was used to compare the effects
   of SSI-COMM on SOP and CVGCA. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis
   was conducted to identify and describe the students who showed similar
   patterns based on score changes in SOP and CVGCA and to create student
   profiles to investigate how to appropriately target those students to
   develop their SOP and CVGCA. The results indicated that students' SOP
   and CVGCA scores improved after the students participated in SSI-COMM.
   In detail, a 6-cluster option was determined to provide the best
   representation of the data measured before and after intervention
   (groups A to F). Although there were some differences in the pattern of
   score change among groups, four groups out of six groups (groups A, B,
   C, and D; about 69\%) showed a positive change after implementing
   SSI-COMM. SOP scores were found to be statistically significant in all
   groups except group E, and CVGCA scores were statistically significant
   only in groups A, B, and C.},

Abstract = {An effective way to improve students' mathematical knowledge is to have
   them construct multiple solutions for real-world problems. Prior
   knowledge is a relevant prerequisite for learning outcomes, and the
   experience of competence is a basic need that has to be fulfilled to
   improve achievement. In the current experimental study (N = 307), we
   investigated how the construction of multiple solutions for real-world
   problems by applying multiple (two) mathematical procedures affected
   students' procedural and conceptual knowledge and their experience of
   competence. Path analyses showed that constructing multiple solutions
   for real-world problems increased students' feelings of competence and
   affected their procedural and conceptual knowledge indirectly through
   the experience of competence. Moreover, students' prior knowledge
   affected their knowledge at posttest directly as well as indirectly via
   their experience of competence.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the application of the methodology developed in
   research on learning progressions to a health-related topic. More
   specifically, we present a human nutrition learning progression as a
   hypothesis that now requires empirical validation. The study involved
   three phases. In the first phase, we analysed the existing literature in
   the domain of human nutrition. Based on this analysis, phase 2 then
   involved drawing up a learning progression for this domain and
   identifying the learning targets and progress variables, as well as the
   upper and lower anchors. The analysis led us to identify five progress
   variables, associated with the development of the concepts of food,
   nutrient, energy and diet, as well as with the ability to classify foods
   according to their nutrients. Finally, in phase 3, we identified and
   described the pathways that students may follow in relation to each
   progress variable. Given its focus on a topic closely linked to personal
   health, the learning progression may be useful not only as a component
   of teaching modules that aim to improve scientific literacy but also as
   a platform for future health education campaigns that seek to promote

Abstract = {This multiple case study examines how teachers request students' use of
   their content knowledge and conceptual understandings from out-of-school
   experiences while reasoning about science concepts and the ways in which
   students perceive and respond to these requests. Three middle school
   teachers and a total of 57 middle school students participated in this
   study. The data collection involved classroom observations and multiple
   interviews with each of the teachers individually and with small groups
   of students. The findings indicate that the students appreciate the
   usefulness of making relevant connections between their in-school and
   out-of-school learning, but seldom do so during science lessons. We also
   found that teachers' attempts to facilitate these types of connections
   during classroom discourse events involved the use of analogies,
   examples, or questions. Finally, the findings also indicate that
   students often recognize teachers' requests but seldom relate to these
   requests in the way the teacher intends.},

Abstract = {Inquiry engagement is a newly defined construct that represents the
   participation in carrying out practices of science and engineering to
   achieve learning outcomes and is influenced by learners' personalities
   and teachers' roles. Expectancy value theory posits that attainment
   values are important components of task values that, in turn, directly
   influence students' achievement-related choices and performance. The
   current paper developed and validated the McGill Attainment Value for
   Inquiry Engagement Survey (MAVIES) with undergraduate students in STEM
   disciplines. The MAVIES is a 67-item, learner-focused survey that
   addresses four components that are theoretically important for engaging
   in scientific inquiry: (a) teachers' roles, (b) students' personalities,
   (c) inquiry learning outcomes, and (d) practices of science and
   engineering. Evidence for internal consistency and construct, content,
   and criterion validity was obtained from 85 undergraduates who had
   experience with scientific inquiry in diverse STEM fields. Confirmatory
   factor analyses confirmed factors that were consistent with role theory,
   Big Five personality traits, revised Bloom's learning outcomes, and the
   Next Generation Science Standards. The MAVIES instrument is a reliable
   and valid instrument for measuring undergraduate students' attainment
   values for scientific inquiry engagement in STEM disciplines.},

Abstract = {Prior graphing research has demonstrated that clinical interviews and
   free-response instruments produce very different results than
   multiple-choice instruments, indicating potential validity problems when
   using multiple-choice instruments to assess graphing skills (Berg \&
   Smith in Science Education, 78(6), 527-554, 1994). Extending this
   inquiry, we studied whether empirically derived, participant-generated
   graphs used as choices on the multiple-choice graphing instrument
   produced results that corresponded to participants' responses on
   free-response instruments. The 5 - 8 choices on the multiple-choice
   instrument came from graphs drawn by 770 participants from prior
   research on graphing (Berg, 1989; Berg \& Phillips in Journal of
   Research in Science Teaching, 31(4), 323-344, 1994; Berg \& Smith in
   Science Education, 78(6), 527-554, 1994). Statistical analysis of the
   736 7th - 12th grade participants indicate that the empirically derived
   multiple-choice format still produced significantly more
   ``picture-of-the-event{''} responses than did the free-response format
   for all three graphing questions. For two of the questions, participants
   who drew graphs on the free-response instruments produced significantly
   more correct responses than those who answered multiple-choice items. In
   addition, participants having ``low classroom performance{''} were
   affected more significantly and negatively by the multiple-choice format
   than participants having ``medium{''} or ``high classroom
   performance.{''} In some cases, prior research indicating the prevalence
   of ``picture-of-the-event{''} and graphing treatment effects may be
   spurious results, a product of the multiple-choice item format and not a
   valid measure of graphing abilities. We also examined how including a
   picture of the scenario on the instrument versus only a written
   description affected responses and whether asking participants to add
   marker points to their constructed or chosen graph would overcome the
   short-circuited thinking that multiple-choice items seem to produce.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on an action research-based professional learning
   programme (PLP) in which early career teachers volunteered to identify
   and then research an aspect of their science teaching practice. The PLP
   was facilitated by academics from the School of Education and the
   Barbara Hardy Institute at the University of South Australia. The
   teachers, who worked in low socio-economic areas of Adelaide's northern
   suburbs, participated in the programme in order to enhance their
   pedagogical content knowledge about science. They also shared an
   interest in connecting their students to the natural world through
   citizen science. The PLP utilised collaborative practices and engagement
   within a socio-constructivist pedagogical framework. As a result of
   their participation, the teachers reported increased confidence to plan
   and teach units of work that moved away from textbook-orientated
   approaches to science. Teachers were interviewed at key points during
   the PLP, and transcripts were analysed against Tytler's (Re-imagining
   science education: Engaging students in science for Australia's future.
   Camberwell, Victoria: ACER Press, 2007) proposed curriculum framework
   for science. This case study identified teacher learning, and the
   strengths and limitations of the PLP, thus enabling the facilitators to
   reflect on the programme.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a study which sought to investigate how social and
   political influences affect students' preference for language of
   instruction in mathematics in Ghana, where the language of instruction
   from grade 4 onwards in school is not the students' main language. 4
   focus group interviews were carried out with 16 primary school students,
   randomly selected from 4 primary schools, comprising a mix of average,
   above average and below average achieving schools in the Cape Coast
   metropolis of Ghana. Qualitative analysis of the results brought to
   light evidence of social and political influences on students'

Abstract = {In a large-scale longitudinal study, 11-year-old schoolchildren were
   given a control-of-variables task, and their scores in this were related
   to their progress in learning about science at school over the next 3
   years. The aim of the control-of-variables task was to measure
   children's understanding that in a properly controlled scientific
   comparison one variable is tested at a time, while other variables are
   held constant. There were 2 kinds of question in the task. In one, the
   pupils were asked to judge whether particular comparisons between 2
   situations were valid ones, in which all variables apart from the one
   being tested were held constant. In the other, they were asked to set up
   a valid comparison themselves. The pupils' scores for both kinds of item
   successfully predicted their progress in science at school later on,
   even after controls for the effects of differences in age and IQ. Their
   success in setting up valid comparisons was a better predictor in the
   long term than the choices that they made in judging whether given
   comparisons were valid or not.},

   PROFICIENCY: IN THE CASE OF STUDENTS WITH HEARING IMPAIRMENT},

Abstract = {For over two decades, there has been increasing concern regarding the
   science learning of disadvantaged students such as indigenous or
   disabled students. The academic achievement of students with hearing
   impairment has been seen as relatively low. This low achievement has
   been mainly due to students' poor literal ability and not because of
   their low intellectual ability. Interactive experiences and the repeated
   use of previously learned terms have been suggested as being important
   to improve their literacy. In addition, it is well recognized that for
   all students to experience success in science education, literacy needs
   to be considered as a crucial factor when setting educational goals
   among students with limited language proficiency. This study presents a
   strategy for teaching science to students with limited language
   proficiency based on a teaching strategy which deliberately focuses on
   written expression in the context of hands-on scientific activities. The
   influence of this teaching strategy upon hearing impaired students'
   language proficiency and inquiry skills was also examined. Results
   revealed the students' language proficiency was enhanced in terms of
   fluency of expression, and their inquiry skills were also improved as
   compared to the students in a control group among whom the teaching
   strategy was not used. These results demonstrated that this teaching
   strategy which focuses on students' written expression and inquiry
   skills through scientific activity can improve the literacy of students
   with limited language proficiency as well as increase their learning
   success in science.},

Abstract = {This report provides an overview of neuroscience research that is
   applicable for science educators. It first offers a brief analysis of
   empirical studies in educational neuroscience literature, followed by
   six science concept learning constructs based on the whole brain theory:
   gaining an understanding of brain function; pattern recognition and
   consciousness; mind maps, mnemonics and other learning devices; concrete
   multisensory experience; higher-order creative reasoning via a
   multimedia-infused environment and positive emotion in educational
   settings. It is vital to the future of results-based education that
   discoveries regarding the cognitive learning process are taken into
   consideration when designing instruction. This research offers science
   educators neuroscience-backed information as a foundation to develop
   results-oriented curricula and teaching methods. Future research could
   further extend an empirically driven education system.},

Abstract = {Though many research-based problem types have been shown effective in
   promoting students' conceptual understanding and scientific abilities,
   the extent of their use in actual classrooms remains unclear. We
   interviewed and surveyed 16 physics and engineering faculty members at a
   large US Midwest research university to investigate how university
   instructors value and use different types of problems in teaching their
   introductory courses. Most of these instructors valued traditional
   textbook problems as a useful building block and used them frequently.
   They also valued non-traditional problems but seldom used them in their
   introductory courses. The divergence between value and use in part is
   due to limited resources and experience, time constraints, student
   reactions, and personal preferences. It is, however, also due to the
   fact that the beliefs held by some instructors regarding the nature of
   problem solving deviate from commonly accepted views in educational
   research. Although on average instructors were hesitant to reduce more
   than 20 \% of course content for research-based materials, they showed
   great interest in collaborating with educational researchers at a more
   personal level to increase the use of non-traditional problems in
   teaching. Our study indicates that instructors need not only
   research-based problems suitable for their introductory classes, but
   also assistance in how to effectively implement these problems.},

Abstract = {Many rural indigenous communities rely on science knowledge and
   innovation for survival and economic advancement, which requires
   community members to be motivated for learning science. Children in
   these communities have been viewed by some as unmotivated due to their
   low science achievement as they progress in school, particularly into
   majority secondary schools. Current theories of motivation, such as
   achievement goal theory, take classroom context into account when
   examining individual motivation. However, motivational climate can also
   be considered as tightly woven with the cultural and social practices of
   a community rather than individual perception. In this study,
   researchers spent time in two indigenous villages observing classrooms,
   participating in community events, and talking with community members.
   During those visits, Attayal/Sediq children in Taiwan (n = 18) and Mopan
   Mayan children in Belize (n = 18) participated in three semi-structured
   interviews about their experience learning science in school, home, and
   community. Results indicate that motivation for learning science is
   closely linked with their identity as science learners. Three themes
   emerged to illuminate how social practices may or may not support
   individual identity, and consequently motivation, for learning
   science-student/teacher relationships, support for learning, and
   motivational climate. Differences between children in Taiwan and Belize
   are explored. Implications for motivation theory, educational practice,
   and policy are discussed.},

Abstract = {There is a growing movement toward the introduction of algebra in early
   grades. This is supported by an increasing number of research studies
   that have reported success in getting young students to ``do{''}
   mathematics considered beyond their reach. Yet, the consensus is that
   more research is needed to provide insights into the processes by which
   students make sense of algebraic ideas. In particular, more studies are
   needed on how nonlinear functions can be introduced in early grades.
   This article reports an algebra research strand that introduced seventh
   grade students to quadratic functions using Guess-My-Rule games. The
   article describes several instances of the students engaging
   successfully with ideas and forms of reasoning involving quadratic
   functions. The purpose is to contribute to the debate on the
   introduction of algebra in early grades by providing further evidence of
   young students' ability to engage with algebraic ideas usually
   considered to be beyond their reach.},

Abstract = {In this qualitative case study, the researchers explored 3 8th grade
   teachers' formative assessment practices as it occurred during their
   mathematics instruction at socioeconomic status (SES)-different schools
   in Taiwan. Instructionally embedded formative assessment we refer to as
   discourse-based assessment practice (DAP). In Taiwan, there is a large
   mathematics achievement gap among high SES and low SES and minority
   students in 8th grade. Addressing this issue at the level of classroom
   practice, we attempt to document teachers' DAP using a parsimonious, but
   practical framework for analyzing classroom discourse in 23 lessons. For
   the purpose of this study, 3 lessons for each teacher are represented.
   The extended sequence (Mehan, 1979) was the primary unit of analysis, to
   which we applied our framework for illuminating and differentiating the
   teachers' press for student understanding through questions and
   feedback. The analysis of the teacher's instruction at the high SES
   indicated that it was more formative than the others, pressing for
   mathematical understanding. The 2 teachers at the low SES schools
   pressed for rote understanding, though there were qualitative
   differences between them. The findings raise more questions and
   implications for research and education policy. In Taiwan where there is
   scant research on classroom practices, DAP as an instructional
   improvement may be a starting point for educational improvement for all
   its students.},

Title = {DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTION RESEARCH TO PROMOTE CHEMISTRY TEACHERS'
   PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT-A JOINED THEORETICAL REFLECTION ON TWO CASES

Abstract = {Action research is defined as using research activities to develop
   concrete societal practices. Action research understands the change of
   practice as being already a central aim of the research process itself,
   and it also seeks to contribute to the professional development of all
   participants in the particular field of study. Even though (or maybe
   even because) action research has a long history in the literature,
   there is a wide variety of interpretations of it. These range all the
   way from research supportive, via interactive, to emancipatory
   approaches. There is also a broad range of objectives covering both
   improving professional environments and generating results of general
   interest. This paper explores the spectrum of justifications given for
   action research with a specific focus on science education. Two
   completely different examples of action research selected from Israel
   and Germany help illustrate the diversity of the topic. The Israeli case
   focuses primarily on the professional development of a group of
   teachers; the German example hones in on the development of suitable
   curricula and lesson plans for wide dissemination. Comparison of these
   two projects is embedded in a theoretical framework which categorizes
   the different action research modes and contemplates teachers'
   professional development. The aim of this paper is to reflect upon the
   common potential inherent in differing forms of action research on
   science education, including the aspect of professional development
   among teachers.},

Abstract = {In the present study, which is a part of a research project about
   realistic word problem solving and problem posing in Chinese elementary
   schools, a problem solving and a problem posing test were administered
   to 128 pre-service and in-service elementary school teachers from
   Tianjin City in China, wherein the teachers were asked to solve 3
   contextually challenging division-with-remainder (DWR) word problems and
   pose word problems according to 3 symbolic expressions. Afterwards, they
   were also given 2 questionnaires wherein they had to evaluate 3
   different pupil reactions to, respectively, 1 problem solving item and 1
   problem posing item about DWR. First, our results revealed that teachers
   behaved quite `realistically' not only when solving and posing DWR
   problems themselves but also when evaluating elementary school pupils'
   DWR problem solving and problem posing performance. Second, we found a
   correspondence between teachers' own performance on the tests and their
   evaluations of pupils' reactions. Third, the present study provides some
   further insight into the role of one of the instructional factors that
   is generally considered responsible for the strong and worldwide
   tendency among elementary school children to neglect real-world
   knowledge and realistic considerations in their endeavours to solve and
   pose mathematical word problems, namely the teachers' conceptions and
   beliefs about this topic.},

Abstract = {International assessment data paints a complex picture of the engagement
   and achievement of New Zealand students in science. New Zealand was
   second only to Finland in the top achievers group in PISA 2006, but it
   also has one of the widest spreads in student achievement, particularly
   in relation to Maori and Pasifika students. Thus, the challenges faced
   by New Zealand students, teachers, schools and policy makers resonate
   with those from elsewhere. New Zealand has a strong research and
   development tradition around student ideas in science education, but
   recently, there has been increased recognition at the policy and
   practice level of the importance of both engagement and participation
   linked to student identity. A sociocultural orientation to identity has
   the potential to generate new ways of thinking about and responding to
   the challenge of engaging students in science. This orientation involves
   considering classrooms as sites for students working through the
   development and performance of science-related identities, or not. In
   this paper, three suggestions from long-term research studies are made
   for ways forward in addressing the challenge of increasing student
   engagement and participation through an expansion of the possibilities
   for students to express and develop science-related identities. These
   are reconceptualising assessment, the inclusion of student funds of
   knowledge and strategies for breaching the classroom walls.},

Abstract = {This article describes an effort to explore and enhance argumentation
   skills of Taiwanese grade 6 students through instruction in
   socioscientific issues. An experienced elementary school teacher was
   given 8 months of personalized instruction on argumentation skills and
   socioscientific issues, then subsequently implemented a 17-h classroom
   unit on the establishment of Ma-Guo National Park. His students learned
   to establish claims and warrants, construct counterarguments, offer
   supportive arguments, and provide evidence for each one. Data consisted
   of student responses to questionnaires and individual follow-up
   interviews. A multiple regression analysis revealed that success in
   learning argumentation skills was not substantially related to
   pre-instruction argumentation skills, but significantly related to the
   student ability levels. High-ability students were significantly better
   than low-ability students at generating complete arguments. Most
   students elaborated their arguments, and more high-ability students
   offered rebuttals after instruction. However, even these high achievers
   did not completely understand the meaning of evidence and often misused
   supplementary warrants as evidence.},

Abstract = {The issue of the area of irregular shapes is absent from the modern
   mathematical textbooks in elementary education in Greece. However, there
   exists a collection of books written for educational purposes by famous
   Greek scholars dating from the eighteenth century, which propose certain
   techniques concerning the estimation of the area of such shapes. We
   claim that, when students deal for an adequate period with a succession
   of carefully designed tasks of the same conceptual basis-in our case
   that of the area of irregular shapes-then they ``reinvent{''}
   problem-solving techniques for the estimation of their area, given that
   they have not been taught anything about these shapes. These techniques,
   in some cases, are almost the same as the abovementioned historical
   ones. In other cases, they could be considered to be an adaptation or
   extension of these.},

Abstract = {In this study, we systematically unpack relationships among student
   socioeconomic status (SES), science and mathematics achievement, and
   student interest in science in the context of varying school
   socioeconomic composition. Using the most recent Programme for
   International Student Assessment dataset for Australia, we found that
   increases in school SES are consistently associated with substantial
   increases in science and mathematics performance. This pattern of
   association held for all groups regardless of their individual SES.
   However, our findings also show that students' interest in science was
   not associated with varying school SES, and only marginally and
   inconsistently associated with individual SES. We discuss policy
   implications and strategies for mitigating the influence of school
   socioeconomic composition on science and mathematics performance, and
   for the achievement of more equitable and effective educational outcomes
   generally.},

Abstract = {We examine the relationship between research and teaching practices as
   they are enacted by university professors in a research-intensive
   university. First we propose a theoretical model for the study of this
   relationship based on Chevallard's anthropological theory. This model is
   used to design and analyze an interview study with physical geographers
   and mathematicians at the University of Copenhagen. We found significant
   differences in how the respondents from the two disciplines assessed the
   relationship between research and teaching. Above all, while geography
   research practices are often and smoothly integrated into geography
   teaching even at the undergraduate level, teaching in mathematics may at
   best be `similar' to mathematical research practice, at least at the
   undergraduate level. Finally, we discuss the educational implications of
   these findings.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess the factors that are related to
   preschool children and their mothers on children's' intuitional
   mathematics abilities. Results of the study showed that there were
   significant differences in children's intuitional mathematics abilities
   when children are given the opportunity to think intuitionally and to
   make estimations, and when their mothers believe in the importance of
   providing such opportunities in the home setting. Children who tended to
   think fast and to examine details of objects had significantly higher
   scores. Also, the working mothers aimed to give opportunities to their
   children more often than non-working mothers. The mothers whose children
   received preschool education tended to give more opportunities to their
   children to think intuitionally and to make estimations. When incorrect
   intuitional answers or estimations were made by children, lower-educated
   mothers tended to scold their children much more than higher educated
   mothers. Mothers having at least a university degree explained more
   often to the children why they were in error than did the less-educated
   mothers.},

Title = {A Framework to Design Creativity-Fostering Mathematical Tasks},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 21},
Abstract = {Fostering students' mathematical creativity is important for their
   understanding and success in mathematics courses as well as their
   persistence in STEM, but it necessitates intentional instructional
   actions, such as designing and implementing tasks that have the
   potential to foster creativity. As teaching innovation requires support
   for instructors who implement them, we developed a creativity-fostering
   task design framework that can be used by instructors of undergraduate
   mathematics courses. In this paper, we share this framework and its
   research-based development process. The framework includes
   research-based task features and aligns with the Creativity-in-Progress
   Reflection (CPR) on problem-solving, a formative assessment instrument.
   We share two creativity-fostering task samples for Calculus 1 courses as
   we notice that this course could be enhanced with such tasks. We also
   discuss ways in which Calculus 1 instructors utilized task features and
   framework as they designed their own tasks. We observed that the
   multiple answers and open-ended features of creativity-fostering tasks
   were frequently incorporated in instructors' tasks; meanwhile, the
   framework provided opportunities for instructors to be intentional about
   creating tasks that incorporate mathematical actions such as making
   connections and taking risks.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the current study is to investigate the roles preferred
   by science teachers in the teaching of socioscientific issues (SSIs) in
   relation to the communicative approach and discourse patterns in the
   context of SSI and non-SSI. In this qualitative study, the holistic
   multiple case study design was used. The study group consisted of three
   science teachers and their students. Video recordings of lessons,
   semi-structured interviews, and vignettes about teacher roles on
   socioscientific issues were used as data sources. The communicative
   approach and discourse patterns of the teachers were analysed by
   discourse analysis in the context of the roles they preferred. At the
   beginning of the study, two teachers seemed to prefer the same role,
   whereas one preferred a different role. As a result of the analysis of
   the video recordings of the teachers' classes, it was determined that
   one of the teachers enacted a different role from the one stated as her
   preferred role. The results of this study can provide a basis for
   professional development activities for teachers who are interested in
   improving the use of the dialogic interactive communicative approach and
   the discourse patterns based on this approach in their teaching.},

Title = {Introduction of Integrated STEM Education to Pre-service Teachers
   Through Collaborative Action Research Practices},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 19},
Abstract = {Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is the leading
   education reform worldwide, yet many teachers need more knowledge and
   confidence to teach integrated STEM. This study examines the initiative
   of teaching a STEM-integrated approach through the collaboration of
   mathematics and science university lecturers and preservice teachers in
   a teaching and learning subject-specific course. The study presents the
   preservice teachers' knowledge development about integrating STEM into
   their lesson plans and their views and attitudes toward the STEM
   approach to teaching. Data were collected through presurveys,
   postsurveys, lesson plans, and presentations from 12 groups (N = 51) of
   preservice mathematics and chemistry teachers. Results show that these
   preservice teachers' experiences with STEM learning and teaching
   positively impacted their understanding and importance of STEM and their
   motivation and enthusiasm to design and present STEM lesson plans in
   group settings while integrating mathematics, chemistry, and other
   subjects. However, the findings of this research showed that these
   preservice teachers needed more knowledge regarding the inclusion of
   formative assessment strategies in their lesson plans. Thus, more
   research is required to understand better how to support preservice and
   in-service teachers' formative assessment practices in the context of
   STEM education. In summary, the finding suggests policymakers and
   educational institutions should advocate for additional high-quality
   integrated STEM courses, programs, and research to enhance and
   institutionalize teaching and learning of integrated STEM and, as a
   result, increase the number of individuals working in STEM professions
   while promoting a consistent vision of integrated STEM education across
   the school system.},

Abstract = {Teachers' teaching practices are influenced by various factors,
   including the teacher's personal (e.g. beliefs, efficacy and attitudes)
   and school context (e.g. administrative and collegial support). However,
   the previous model did not consider the interactions between these
   factors simultaneously in effecting the teaching practices. Thus, an
   integrated model is needed to gain a better understanding of teachers'
   teaching practices. This study proposes a structural equation model by
   integrating beliefs (constructivist conception of teaching and learning)
   (CC), self-efficacy in integrated STEM teaching (SE), attitudes towards
   integrated STEM teaching (ATT) and school context (CF) in predicting
   science teachers' integrated STEM teaching practices (TP). The results
   of a cross-sectional survey of 333 science teachers show that desired
   improvements in the CC, SE, ATT and CF may result in corresponding
   changes in the TP. The effects of CC on TP are fully mediated by ATT,
   while SE affects TP both directly and indirectly via ATT. The results of
   the study provide a theoretical base for prospective researchers
   involved in exploring integrated STEM training or other active learning
   practices.},

Abstract = {The ``leaky pipeline{''} with regard to students' engagement in Science,
   Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) has triggered extensive
   research to understand and prevent students dropping out from STEM. To
   boost enrolment and interest in STEM fields, integrated STEM (iSTEM)
   education could be harnessed by providing students with relevant
   challenges. This study investigated (1) the evolution of affective
   outcomes regarding science and mathematics over time in traditional
   education, (2) the impact of an iSTEM curriculum on affective outcomes
   with regard to science and mathematics, and (3) the differential
   effectiveness of the iSTEM curriculum regarding student characteristics.
   Therefore, an iSTEM intervention was developed and evaluated over the
   course of 2 years. In total, 859 grade 9 students, distributed across 39
   different Belgian schools, participated in the longitudinal study. The
   results of multilevel analyses show that students' attitudes,
   motivation, and self-efficacy with regard to science and mathematics
   tend to become less positive over time in traditional education. On the
   other hand, iSTEM education had positive effects on attitudes towards
   science and mathematics. However, negative results were observed with
   regard to motivation and self-efficacy outcomes. In addition,
   intervention effects differed for boys and girls and for students at
   different socioeconomic status levels. Our results indicate that iSTEM
   has the potential to improve students' attitudes towards STEM, but that
   we should be careful with regard to the implementation of this approach
   in terms of student motivation and self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {The study aims to analyze student responses to chemistry constructed
   response items to obtain detailed information on science NAEA (National
   Assessment of Educational Achievement) in South Korea and to draw
   suggestions for enhancing curriculum, teaching, and learning. For this
   purpose, we analyzed 7444 answers that could be generalized as 1.29\% of
   the 9th grade students by the two-stage stratified cluster sampling
   method. The types of answers to constructed item were classified, and
   the response rate distribution curve according to the achievement score
   for each achievement level was drawn and analyzed. In this way,
   analyzing the descriptive answers is an advantage of the constructed
   response items; that is, students' responses vary widely, and they can
   systematically analyze the various types of misconceptions they have. As
   a result, students at the basic level tended to have misconceptions
   about the quantity of thermal energy, whereas students above proficient
   level had misconceptions about thermal equilibrium. Therefore, both the
   understanding and misconceptions of students differed according to
   achievement levels, so customized teaching and learning based on
   achievement levels should be developed. And the implications for
   curricula and improvement of teachers' expertise in assessment of
   constructed items are suggested.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of the Interactive
   Learning Materials Triangle (iLMT) on the learning and knowledge
   retention of 12-year-old students. The iLMT is a digital version of the
   standard school learning materials in Serbia, and is characterized by a
   high degree of interactivity and immediate feedback during the learning
   process. We conducted an experiment to explore whether iLMT influences
   student success in solving mathematical tasks that require different
   types of mathematical reasoning. Based on previous extensive research by
   Lithner, 4 types of tasks are discussed: high relatedness answer, high
   relatedness algorithm, local low relatedness, and global low
   relatedness. The study involved 633 students and 13 teachers of
   mathematics, equally distributed in control and test groups. The main
   findings indicate that student success on a knowledge test for high
   relatedness answer and local low relatedness tasks for the test group
   was significantly higher than for the control group. On the knowledge
   retention test, students in the test group outperformed students in the
   control group at high relatedness algorithm and local low relatedness
   tasks. Our results also suggest that, even when learning materials are
   carefully digitalized with the use of available technological
   advantages, student success in global low relatedness tasks may still be
   lacking.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this mixed methods research was to investigate the
   development of 55 preservice elementary teachers' science teaching
   self-efficacy beliefs through analysis of their reflective practices in
   a science method course. This year-long study was conducted at two
   public universities located in the USA and Canada. Within the
   theoretical frameworks of science teaching self-efficacy and reflective
   practice, we examined how and in what ways preservice teachers'
   reflections on their past science experiences and current science
   teaching practices contributed to their self-efficacy beliefs. Data were
   collected from pre- and post-course administrations of the Science
   Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument-B (STEBI-B), written science
   autobiographies, written reflection papers, classroom observations, and
   artifacts. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
   test the significance of the differences between the pre- and
   post-course survey scores. The results indicated statistically
   significant gains in participants' science teaching self-efficacy
   beliefs. The qualitative analysis revealed that preservice teachers'
   initial self-efficacy beliefs evolved through years of formal and
   informal interactions with science. New levels of self-efficacy were
   reached, as evident from participants' self-reflection on their field
   teaching. The findings indicate the importance of field experiences and
   reflective practices for preservice elementary teachers' preparation and
   science teaching self-efficacy. The study offers implications for
   preservice teacher education programs, science teacher education, and
   research.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the current study was to explore and further elucidate
   secondary teachers' knowledge of students' conceptions (KOSC) on the
   topic of evolution by natural selection. Prior research has documented
   students' natural selection conceptions, but allowing the opportunity
   for teachers to describe their own students' conceptions can permit more
   novel dimensions of student conceptions to emerge, especially since
   teachers possess a specialized knowledge of their students. Using
   teacher interviews, student artifacts, and video-recorded classroom
   observations as data sources, the study employed a grounded theory
   approach to document the KOSC for natural selection from four biology
   teachers in a high-needs public high school in the southwestern United
   States. Results indicated the teachers identified student conceptions
   consistent with prior research, but also identified novel dimensions of
   KOSC including how students use their everyday experiences to think
   about natural selection. The teachers' KOSC was then confirmed through
   classroom observations and student artifacts. The study's findings
   provide an elaborated framing with which to better understand and
   leverage student conceptions-which are fundamental in reform-oriented
   instructional approaches.},

Abstract = {Numeric relational reasoning is a foundational mathematical idea for
   young children and is predictive of future success in mathematics.
   However, no readily available assessments exist that fully assess
   relational reasoning in young children. RTI International developed a
   Relational Reasoning subtask for potential inclusion on the Early Grade
   Mathematics Assessment (EGMA). Numeric relational reasoning items were
   developed to focus on equivalence, decomposition, and multiplicative
   thinking, and both symbolic and visual item formats were utilized. The
   items developed for the EGMA Relational Reasoning subtask were pilot
   tested with 1486 students in Grades 2-3. This paper details the
   characteristics of the Relational Reasoning items developed and validity
   evidence that was collected to support an assumption about technical
   adequacy and reliability on an interpretation-use argument.},

Abstract = {This study explores the relationship between students' perceptions and
   teachers' discourse practices in mathematics classrooms. It reframes the
   sequence of Initiate-Response-Follow-up (IRF) with a renewed discourse
   structure that focuses on teachers' follow-up actions including
   listening, thoughtful questioning, and effective talk moves.
   Specifically, the study analyzes how these follow-up actions were
   related to positive student perceptions about their teachers' discourse
   practices around sustaining productive discussions in mathematics
   classrooms. Participants were secondary mathematics teachers (n = 57)
   and their students (n = 875) in U.S. schools. The study first considered
   the students' perceptions of their teachers' discourse practices,
   identifying which teachers were perceived by students to implement
   mathematics discussions. Next, the study identified and examined
   patterns of teacher practices in discussions-the teachers' talk moves,
   duration, and frequency in asking follow-up questions. Findings indicate
   that the teachers identified by students as promoting mathematics
   discussion tended to ask follow-up questions that increased and
   sustained students' participation in mathematics discussions. What this
   finding implies is that in asking follow-up questions, the teacher
   listened and responded to students' ideas, and students felt heard. The
   study asserts that there is much potential for enhancing mathematics
   instruction by learning more about how teachers listen to and build on
   students' responses.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to analyze the development of middle school
   science teachers' understanding of engineering design process. The study
   conceptualized engineering design process that serves as an important
   context for integrating engineering into K-12 science instruction and
   described patterns teachers might use to move towards a more
   sophisticated understanding. Qualitative case study method was employed
   to systematically investigate differences in science teachers'
   understanding of engineering design process. The procedures of the study
   included development of an initial version of an engineering design
   process progression, delivery of a teacher professional development
   program, and development of the final version of the progression
   following revisions. The teacher professional development program was
   implemented with 30 middle school science teachers and was used to
   collect data for refinement of the initial version of the progression.
   Data sources included informative literature, teacher logs, and clinical
   interviews. Results indicated that a higher level of understanding
   pointed to a recognition of the contribution of engineering design to
   the society and the iterative nature of engineering design process. This
   level of understanding was also shown to contain possible confusions of
   the design steps; redesign and communication. Implications of the study
   contribute to future research and thinking about middle school science
   teachers' understanding of the engineering design process from novice to
   sophisticated level.},

Abstract = {Students' personal interest is hypothesized to be an important resource
   for learning, but only a few empirical studies have investigated the
   effect of interest on academic achievement and motivational outcomes of
   university studies. This lack of empirical studies is remarkable,
   because inadequate individual prerequisites are considered one reason
   for study drop-out. High drop-out rates in mathematics studies highlight
   students' difficulties at the transition from school to university
   mathematics. The main aim of this contribution is to analyze the impact
   of cognitive learning prerequisites and mathematics interest on the
   outcomes in the first semester of a university mathematics program. In
   line with person-object theories of interest, we differentiate interest
   facets that reflect the changing nature of mathematics at the
   transition. We report results of a prediction study with 202 students
   enrolled in a university mathematics program. Correlation analyses show
   weak relations between interest and cognitive prerequisites. Regression
   analyses indicate that interest in proof and formal representations is a
   strong predictor for study satisfaction and motivation, whereas only
   cognitive prerequisites show an impact on achievement. Our results
   indicate how and to what extent the specified instruments measuring
   individual interests may inform study guidance before and student
   support during the first semester of a university mathematics program.},

Abstract = {Science texts often use visual representations (e.g. diagrams, graphs,
   photographs) to help readers learn science knowledge. Reading an
   illustrated text for learning is one type of multimedia learning.
   Empirical research has increasingly confirmed the signaling principle's
   effectiveness in multimedia learning. Highlighting correspondences
   between text and pictures benefits learning outcomes. However, the
   signaling effect's cognitive processes and its generalizability to young
   readers are unknown. This study clarified these aspects using
   eye-tracking technology and reading tests. Eighty-nine sixth-grade
   students read an illustrated science text in one of three conditions:
   reading material with signals, without signals (identical labels of
   Diagram 1 and Diagram 2 in text and illustration), and with signals
   combined with reading instructions. Findings revealed that the signaling
   principle alone cannot be generalized to young readers. Specifically,
   Diagram 1 and Diagram 2 in parentheses mixed with science text content
   had limited signaling effect for students and reading instructions are
   necessary. Eye movements reflected cognitive processes of science
   reading; students who received reading instructions employed greater
   cognitive effort and time in reading illustrations and tried to
   integrate textual and pictorial information using signals.},

Abstract = {This study investigated Chinese primary school mathematics teachers'
   views on assessment in an effort to determine their assessment profiles.
   A large-scale questionnaire survey with 1101 teachers from 12 Chinese
   provinces and regions was carried out. The teachers reported to use
   assessment on a daily or weekly basis for different purposes. They
   recognized the importance of assessing different types of skills and
   knowledge and considered assessment useful for improving teaching and
   learning. To determine teachers' assessment profiles, we used several
   latent variable modeling techniques. With exploratory factor analyses,
   we identified eight factors in the teachers' responses: general
   instructional decision-making assessment purposes {[}1], specific
   instructional decision-making assessment purposes {[}2], assessment
   methods {[}3], diversity of assessment problem format {[}4], importance
   of assessing skills and knowledge {[}5], importance of assessing
   extra-curricular skills {[}6], Perceived usefulness {[}7], and
   acceptance of assessment {[}8]. When these factors were used to
   interpret the results of a latent class analysis, three distinct
   assessment profiles could be distinguished. One fifth of the teachers
   were in the Enthusiastic assessors profile. These teachers not only
   reported to use assessment frequently {[}3, 4] and purposefully {[}1,
   2], but also highly endorsed its importance {[}5, 6] and usefulness
   {[}7, 8]. Around half of the teachers were in the Mainstream assessors
   profile; these teachers scored close to the mean on all factors. The
   remaining teachers held the relatively negative views on assessment and
   were therefore in the Unenthusiastic assessors profile. This profile
   characterization sheds light on Chinese primary school mathematics
   teachers' assessment culture.},

Abstract = {Preservice teachers in six sections (n = 87) of a sequenced,
   methodological and process-integrated elementary mathematics/science
   methods course were able to reconcile an issue centered on a similar
   area of epistemology. Preservice teachers participated in a science
   inquiry lesson on biological classification and a mathematics
   problem-solving lesson on polyhedra. Preservice teachers were asked why
   it was possible to derive a mathematical formula for polyhedra and not
   organisms and what this implies about the similarities and differences
   between the epistemologies of mathematics and science. An area of
   epistemology known as simplicity was triangulated as ``simple versus
   complex{''} emerged from the constant comparative method (28 \%) and
   ``justification and simplicity{''} (96 \%) was coded with a content
   analysis. Implications include how methods course instructors can create
   other appropriate activities which incorporate and reconcile other areas
   of epistemology.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
   cooperative learning based on conceptual change approach instruction on
   ninth-grade students' understanding in chemical bonding concepts
   compared to traditional instruction. Seventy-two ninth-grade students
   from two intact chemistry classes taught by the same teacher in a public
   high school participated in the study. The classes were randomly
   assigned as the experimental and control group. The control group (N =
   35) was taught by traditional instruction while the experimental group
   (N = 37) was taught cooperative learning based on conceptual change
   approach instruction. Chemical Bonding Concept Test (CBCT) was used as
   pre- and post-test to define students' understanding of chemical bonding
   concepts. After treatment, students' interviews were conducted to
   observe more information about their responses. Moreover, students from
   experimental groups were interviewed to obtain information about
   students' perceptions on cooperative work experiences. The results from
   ANCOVA showed that cooperative learning based on conceptual change
   approach instruction led to better acquisition of scientific conceptions
   related to chemical bonding concepts than traditional instruction.
   Interview results demonstrated that the students in the experimental
   group had better understanding and fewer misconceptions in chemical
   bonding concepts than those in the control group. Moreover, interviews
   about treatment indicated that this treatment helped students' learning
   and increased their learning motivation and their social skills.},

Title = {Third-Graders' Conceptions About the Origin of Species Before and After
   Instruction: an Exploratory Study},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This study examines how third-graders' conceptions about the origin of
   species are affected by formal instruction and whether children can
   learn not only about evolution but also about natural selection. We
   interviewed the same group of third-grade children (8-9 years old)
   twice, before and after following a curriculum about these topics.
   Creationist answers were very rare at both pre- and post-tests. The
   number of evolutionist answers increased significantly after
   instruction. However, children learned about evolution in a piecemeal
   way; they gave evolutionist answers for only some of the animals they
   were asked about and made several errors when putting classes of
   vertebrates on a time line. In addition, only a minority of children
   learned something about evolutionary mechanisms. They said that new-born
   animals can be different from the parents because of mutations but did
   not mention differential survival. These results challenge the views,
   according to which, cognitive biases (i.e. essentialism, teleological
   and intentional thinking) make children unreceptive to evolution.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at identifying the levels of scientific reasoning of
   upper primary stage (grades 4-7) science teachers based on their use of
   a problem-solving strategy. The study sample (N = 138; 32 \% male and 68
   \% female) was randomly selected using stratified sampling from an
   original population of 437 upper primary school teachers. The scientific
   reasoning test was based on a problem-solving strategy and consisted of
   five parts (32 items) covering basic problem-solving skills. Descriptive
   and inferential statistics were used to interpret the data. Results
   indicated that the level of scientific reasoning of these science
   teachers was high with significant gender differences (p aecurrency
   signaEuroe0.05) on levels of scientific reasoning that favored the
   female teachers. The results also showed no significant differences (p >
   0.05) in scientific thinking among teachers with different experiences,
   qualifications, and specializations. These results support holding
   professional development courses for teachers to develop their
   scientific reasoning and thinking skills.},

Abstract = {This study examines gender differences of teachers on their mathematical
   knowledge for teaching in the context of single-sex classrooms in Saudi
   Arabia. A translated version of the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching
   (MKT) instrument (Learning Mathematics for Teaching {[}LMT], 2008) in
   Number and Operation Content Knowledge (CK) and Knowledge of Content and
   Student (KCS) scales were administered to 197 teachers (146 male and 51
   female). Two-sample t test and multiple regression were conducted to
   compare the two groups and test the effect of teacher background
   variables. Female teachers significantly scored better than their male
   counterpart. Gender, years of teaching experience, and specialization
   significantly predicted teachers' content knowledge, F(3, 187) 13,180,
   explaining 41,8 A) of the variance. Only gender and specialization
   significantly predicted teachers' knowledge of content and student, F(2,
   191) = 6.335, explaining 24.9 \% of the variance. Further comparing
   items in the MKT instrument where female teachers outperformed male
   teachers confirmed that female teachers were better in attending to the
   content knowledge in the context of student's learning.},

Abstract = {The psychometric properties of a 10-item math motivation scale were
   empirically validated with an independent sample consisting of 182
   elementary-school students. Analysis of the model dimensionality
   supported a one-factor structure fit. Item parameter estimates from a
   Classical Test Theory framework revealed that most items were highly
   discriminating, and the survey is informative for students of low to
   average math motivation. Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses
   found two items exhibiting gender bias. Overall, the instrument was a
   psychometrically valid instrument for measuring math motivation at the
   elementary level.},

Abstract = {The present study explores reasoning and argumentation in Greek
   mathematics and physics texts in specific topics related to the notion
   of periodicity. In our study, argumentation is taken as the sequence of
   the modes of reasoning (MsoR) that an author develops in a text when
   organizing and presenting new knowledge. Inductive content analysis was
   applied on 71 thematic units taken from 4 mathematics and 4 physics
   textbooks, and a coding system of categories and subcategories of MsoR
   was produced. Our analysis discerned 4 main categories of MsoR:
   empirical, logical-empirical, nomological, and mathematical; we argue
   that each mode of reasoning (MoR) plays a different role in
   conceptualizing aspects of periodicity. Analysis of the sequence of MsoR
   in two thematic units raised pragmatic considerations on the text
   understanding in relation to the scientific argumentation discourse and
   highlights ontological differences in the two subjects when ascending
   from observations to generalizations. Educational implications of the
   findings are discussed.},

Title = {Effects of Mathematics Content Knowledge on Pre-school Teachers'
   Performance: a Video-Based Assessment of Perception and Planning

Abstract = {This study addresses the relation of pre-school teachers' mathematics
   content knowledge and their performance-how they perceive mathematical
   learning situations and whether they are able to plan adequate actions
   that foster children's learning-in the informal settings of pre-schools.
   It thus addresses a serious gap in teacher research that has so far
   mostly been focussed on the formal settings of primary and secondary
   schools. The paper presents the instruments used to assess the knowledge
   (a paper-pencil test) and the performance (a video-based assessment), as
   well as the results of a study involving 354 prospective pre-school
   teachers. The results indicate that mathematical content knowledge is a
   significant predictor of the pre-school teachers' ability to perceive
   learning situations and to plan educational actions to foster learning.
   Such evidence not only supports the validity of the knowledge test, but
   it is also relevant for policy makers because it leads to conclusions
   about the important opportunities to learn that need to be provided
   during pre-school teacher training.},

Abstract = {Research on the evaluation of the professional knowledge of mathematics
   teachers (comprising for example mathematical content knowledge,
   mathematics pedagogical content knowledge and general pedagogical
   knowledge) has become prominent in the last decade; however, the
   development of video-based assessment approaches is a more recent topic.
   This paper follows the call for more situated and performance-related
   ways to assess teacher competence. We discuss the theoretical and
   methodological challenges connected to the development of such
   instruments and exemplify these by an instrument developed within the
   follow-up study of the international ``Teacher Education and Development
   Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M){''}, called TEDS-FU. Drawing on the
   novice-expert framework from cognitive psychology allows analysing the
   structure and development of mathematics teachers' professional
   competence. More recent concepts on teacher noticing of classroom
   situations and students' activities are incorporated into this
   video-based evaluation instrument, which is described in detail in this
   paper, by assessing perceptual, interpretative and decision-making
   skills. Reliability and validity concerns remain an issue of such
   assessments for which solutions are proposed. Overall, the paper shows
   that a more comprehensive evaluation of teachers' competence comprising
   cognitive-affective and situated facets is possible and has been
   achieved.},

Abstract = {Algebra is the fundamental language of mathematics, and a profound
   understanding of school algebra is an important prerequisite for further
   studies in mathematical sciences. The aim of this study is to
   characterize the algebraic competence of the Norwegian upper secondary
   school students participating in Trends in International Mathematics and
   Science Study (TIMSS) Advanced. Based on theoretical conceptualizations
   of school algebra (Kieran, 2004) and of mathematical competence (Niss \&
   Hojgaard, 2011), a set of item descriptors have here been developed.
   Each of the algebra items in the TIMSS Advanced mathematics test have
   then been evaluated with respect to these descriptors, and correlations
   between student performance and item descriptors have been calculated.
   The results show that Norwegian upper secondary school students tend to
   perform weakly on items that place high demands on symbol manipulation.
   Furthermore, these students' strength is in tasks that are placed in an
   extra-mathematical (applied) context, that require text comprehension,
   where students are expected to generate the mathematical expressions
   needed to find a solution, but that place low demands on student ability
   to manipulate symbolic expressions. Hence, the results of this study
   suggests that if Norwegian upper secondary school students' mastery of
   algebra is to be promoted, it seems reasonable to devote more teaching
   resources to the transformational aspects of algebraic activity, i.e. to
   developing their ability to efficiently manipulate symbolic expressions.},

Abstract = {Three teaching methods were compared in this study, namely a Cognitive
   Conflict Management Module (CCM) that is infused into Cognitive
   Acceleration through Science Education (CASE), (Module A) CASE without
   CCM (Module B) and a conventional teaching method. This study employed a
   pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design using non-equivalent
   control groups. The design involved 130 participants from Form 2 (Grade
   7) in a Malaysian secondary school. The cognitive level of all
   participants was classified as non-formal operational on the pre-test
   and were allocated to one of the four intact groups: experimental group
   1, EP1 experienced Module A, experimental group, and EP2 experienced
   Module B, while the others were divided between two control groups. The
   impact of the three teaching methods on the level of cognitive
   development and science achievement were observed after a 20-week
   intervention. Data were analysed using multivariate analysis of
   variance/multivariate analysis of covariance, analysis of covariance and
   a paired-samples t test. It is hoped that this study can contribute to
   knowledge in the field of cognitive intervention and cognitive conflict
   strategy. The findings show that a high dose of cognitive intervention
   in CASE activities within a short period has an effect on the levels of
   students' cognitive development, standard science achievement and
   constructive cognitive conflict.},

Abstract = {Constructing explanations and participating in argumentative discourse
   are seen as essential practices of scientific inquiry. The objective of
   this study was to explore the elements and origins of pre-service
   secondary science teachers' alternative conceptions of tidal phenomena
   based on the elements used in Toulmin's Argument Model through
   qualitative research. The data were collected from three pre-service
   secondary school teachers (D.-K. University, Teachers' Colleges, junior
   and senior) in the Republic of Korea using a variety of qualitative
   research methods. We present three pre-service teachers as examples of
   20 pre-service teachers for determining each pre-service teacher whether
   the pattern of his/her responses to all of the questions investigating a
   given concept can be explained by the consistent use of components of
   argument. The results of this study showed ``the model with the Earth's
   center at rest{''} backing their warrants as an element of Toulmin's
   Argument Model. As a result, science educators must explicitly address
   these presuppositions or implicit beliefs and must help the students
   form links between their everyday experiences and scientific knowledge.
   Therefore, educators must be aware of the influence of students'
   presuppositions and must use acceptable scientific concepts (the center
   of mass of the Earth-Moon system) based on argumentation to guide their
   construction of scientific concepts.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore the mathematical problem posing
   performance of students in free structured situations. Two classes of
   fifth grade students (N = 30) were randomly assigned to experimental and
   control groups. The categories of the problems posed in free structured
   situations by the 2 groups of students were studied through inductive
   and deductive content analysis and coded in categories before and after
   a 5-week treatment. The treatment for the experimental group was the
   Interlocked Problem Posing Instruction in which student cognitive
   engagement was emphasized, and for the control group, it was Traditional
   Problem Posing Instruction. The results revealed that the experimental
   group students posed more solvable, reasonable and start-unknown
   problems than the control group students after the treatment.},

Abstract = {The problem of culturally decontextualised mathematics education faced
   by Nepali students, teachers and teacher educators has often been
   oriented by the view of the nature of mathematics as a body of pure
   knowledge, which gives rise to an exclusive emphasis on an ideology of
   singularity, epistemology of objectivism, language of universality and
   logic of certainty whilst developing curriculum, conceiving pedagogies
   and implementing assessment strategies in school mathematics education
   and mathematics teacher education programmes. With epistemic referents
   of dialectical logics and performative imagination, an alternative view
   of the nature of mathematics as an impure knowledge is discussed with
   its possible disempowering features, such as essentialism, hegemony and
   dualisms. Finally, an inclusive view of the nature of mathematics as
   im/pure knowledge system is articulated with the help of various forms
   of dialectics.},

Abstract = {This study explores the perceptions of culturally relevant science
   teaching of 35 teachers of American Indian students. These teachers
   participated in professional development designed to help them better
   understand climate change science content and teaching climate change
   using both Western science and traditional and cultural knowledge.
   Teacher perceptions of practices using culturally relevant instruction
   were evaluated. The data were analyzed both quantitatively and
   qualitatively. The results from the survey analysis show that the
   teachers' existing practices of culturally relevant science teaching
   were limited in choosing topics relevant to American Indian culture. We
   found three common themes from the teachers' perceptions of culturally
   relevant science teaching, meaning of culturally relevant science
   teaching, teaching strategies, and purpose of culturally relevant
   science teaching from the qualitative data. We also found that teachers
   with higher survey scores perceive culturally relevant science teaching
   differently than teachers with lower survey scores, specifically for the
   purposes and teaching strategies of culturally relevant science
   teaching. The results show that teachers with higher survey scores
   tended to perceive culturally relevant science teaching as a two-way
   learning process between teachers and students where the teachers can
   learn traditional science knowledge from the students. They also tend to
   perceive using concrete traditional science examples as effective
   teaching strategy for culturally relevant science teaching and building
   strong relationships with American Indian students as the most important
   purpose of culturally relevant science teaching. We also discuss common
   challenges faced by science teachers when trying to implement culturally
   relevant science teaching with American Indian students.},

Abstract = {This content analysis of articles in the Social Science Citation Index
   journals from 1995 to 2009 was conducted to provide science educators
   with empirical evidence regarding the effects of scaffolding on science
   learning. It clarifies the definition, design, and implementation of
   scaffolding in science classrooms and research studies. The results show
   important cross-study evidence that most researchers have adopted a
   qualitative approach (67.44\%), focused on learning context (72.09\%),
   and used high school students as participants (53.49\%). In designing
   scaffoldings, researchers have shown a preference for long-term explicit
   scaffolding using multiple representations to promote procedural and
   strategic skills and alternative assessments of learner performance.
   Nevertheless, scaffolding issues related to teacher education are
   unexpectedly few (11.63\%) in empirical research. The results also
   indicate that there are too few studies to guide researchers in
   considering fading scaffolds for active learning (9.30\%). Future
   directions and suggestions toward conducting research regarding
   scaffolding are provided.},

Abstract = {Professional development (PD) of teachers comprises a major challenge in
   many countries. The empirical relations between teaching-learning
   processes and student achievements occupy educators who construct
   teachers' in-service training programs. Student achievements serve as a
   measure for testing improvements in learning. Many investigators view
   teachers' content-didactic knowledge as influencing the quality of
   teaching and student achievements. Large-scale assessments (national and
   international evaluation frameworks) in the Israeli educational system
   offer teachers opportunities for improving their teaching-learning
   processes and student achievements. We developed a program for the PD of
   science teachers based on the curriculum and large-scale assessments.
   The model is long term and integrates theoretical and practical
   knowledge. The activities should be effective and cooperative and should
   use diverse teaching methods and integrate advanced technologies. This
   article presents considerations for the construction of the program, its
   goals, its performance, teachers' reports on the components, and the
   contribution of the program's components to their PD.},

Abstract = {The written representation in Chinese can be considered as a pictorial
   or a symbolic representation which is very different from English where
   the pronunciation is related to how the word is spelt. Students face
   challenges of a very different nature when science is learnt in Chinese
   compared with English. In Hong Kong, students are making translations
   between the language they use in their daily lives, the science concepts
   and the scientific terms. The research team designed an interview
   protocol for primary school pupils in order to identify the pupils'
   alternative concepts of science and if these alternative concepts are
   related to the structure of the Chinese language. The findings suggest
   that there are alternative conceptions related to (a) the form of the
   Chinese character-for example, the Chinese character for crocodile
   includes a radical meaning fish, and so pupils may take it that a
   crocodile is a fish; (b) the meaning of the Chinese character-for
   example, an electronic buzzer is a device used to attract bees as in
   Chinese, the character contains the word meaning ``bees producing
   sound{''}. The findings provide important data for future endeavours
   aiming to compare the learning of science using different languages and
   on ways in which primary teachers may better facilitate their pupils in
   learning science.},

Abstract = {The central focus of this study was the development, use and evaluation
   of CD-ROM picture books in elementary school science teaching. Three
   CD-ROM picture books based on the Campus Insects unit from the new
   elementary school science curriculum in Taiwan were developed. A
   quasi-experimental method was used to compare the use of the CD-ROMs and
   traditional teaching approaches on student performance. The Reading
   Comprehension Tests of Insect Curriculum scores of the treatment-group
   students were significantly better than those of the comparison group
   with a 1.12 effect size. Students taught through normal means acquired
   few descriptive concepts of insects and could not use scientific terms
   to present ideas. However, students taught with CD-ROM picture books
   acquired middle-level or high-level descriptive concepts and used
   scientific terms to present ideas. CD-ROM picture books designed in this
   pattern can attract students' interest in their classes; therefore, we
   suggest primary school teachers use these books in their science
   teaching.},

Abstract = {Thinking Journey is introduced as a mode of science instruction based on
   a specially designed discussion between students and teachers in the
   context of an imaginary journey. The paper elaborates the rationale of
   this mode and its specific features: enculturation into science,
   analytical observation, multiple perspectives of the subject and
   environment, hypothetical thinking, and active interaction between the
   teacher and students. The role of the teacher is argued to be mediation
   of knowledge. The method was applied for teaching the concept of
   gravitation and its relationship with up-down direction. Positive
   results of the application suggest that the TJ mode of teaching is
   effective in teaching various student populations.},

Title = {Teaching Approaches for STEM Integration in Pre- and Primary School: a
   Systematic Qualitative Literature Review},

Abstract = {In the last 5 years, there have been several literature reviews or
   meta-analyses investigating various aspects of STEM education; however,
   they have investigated a specific aspect of STEM, e.g. robotics, or
   digital games, or Early childhood, or Teacher perspectives. In addition,
   a broad-reaching review on STEM integration has not been conducted in
   the past 10 years. This article reports findings from a Systematic
   Qualitative Literature Review concerning STEM education for children
   aged 4-12 in formal education contexts. To provide context, the article
   initially presents descriptive findings (date and country of research,
   age of participants, research setting, and research methodologies used)
   in the 60 research articles that are included for analysis. The article
   then answers three research questions regarding the: (1) level of
   integration evident in the studies; (2) role of engineering in any such
   integration; and (3) teaching approaches used in the studies. Findings
   from this research suggest that there is still much work to be done to
   move from scenarios where STEM integration is claimed but is not evident
   in practice. To do so we encourage educators and researchers to (a)
   focus on authentic interdisciplinary approaches rather than the siloed
   approaches evident in the existing research; and (b) use a teaching
   approach such as problem-based or project-based learning that provide
   opportunities for authentic integration.},

Abstract = {The present study analyzed the structural and the content complexity of
   76 preservice science teachers' socioscientific argumentation in the
   context of a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. Data were analyzed within
   the methodological frame of qualitative content analysis. Concerning the
   structural complexity, the participants' socioscientific argumentation
   reached a relatively high level (i.e., justifications with elaborated
   grounds). Concerning the complexity of content, the sample referred to
   science-, ethics-, society-, and politics-related arguments (i.e.,
   almost the full range of content areas); however, on an individual
   level, participants referred to merely an average of two content areas.
   Regarding the relationship between structural and content complexity, a
   significant positive correlation was found. In sum, the results of this
   study suggest that preservice science teachers' socioscientific
   argumentation is on a promisingly high level in terms of structural and
   on a medium level regarding content complexity. The findings are
   discussed and implications for science teacher education and assessment
   in science education are proposed.},

Abstract = {The initial and continuing training of mathematics teachers continues to
   be one of the most pressing challenges facing the research community in
   mathematics education. In this regard, various research agendas have
   been proposed and developed. Among these, two stand out: the
   characterization and development of (1) didactic and mathematical
   knowledge that allows the teacher to favor the management of his
   classes, and (2) skills necessary for professional practice. Although
   various models have been proposed to attend to each of these agendas
   separately, there are no models that allow an explicit integration
   between the notions of knowledge and teacher competence. On the other
   hand, various studies show the need to have theoretical-methodological
   tools that operationalize the categories of knowledge and skills
   proposed by scientific literature. In this article, the
   didactic-mathematical knowledge (DMK) model is presented as a
   theoretical-methodological alternative that allows for both the analysis
   and the development of essential knowledge and skills for the teacher's
   professional practice. In addition, it delves into a proposal of
   categories and subcategories of professional competencies necessary for
   teaching.},

Abstract = {An international need exists for effective programmes that will enhance
   learners' interest in studies and careers related to science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics, i.e. STEM. When considering the
   impact of STEM programmes, it is important to identify what can enable
   or constrain effective programme implementation. As such, enablers can
   be systematically supported and constraints tackled to maximise a
   programme's impact. This study considers a nationwide STEM programme in
   Finland that involved 450 teachers and their learning communities. The
   study followed an interpretative paradigm, collecting data through
   semi-structured interviews and analysed with data-driven thematic
   analysis. The study participants were 14 external change agents
   operating between participating learning communities and the national
   programme administration and, thus, had a valuable overview on how the
   programme evolved. The most important enablers of effective programme
   implementation were versatile support, programme flexibility and
   long-term vision. Two major constraints were limited resources and
   collaboration challenges. Considering the findings of this study can
   help design effective STEM programmes by providing various support
   mechanisms for educators, particularly scaffolding; peer and school
   administrator support; flexibility to enable embedding activities and
   adapting programme objectives to participants' everyday work; long-term
   vision to support both lifelong learning and a continuum between
   different STEM programmes; sufficient time and economic resources to
   achieve a long-term impact; and collaboration and networking
   opportunities at the local, regional, national and international levels.},

Abstract = {Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment (CDA) is an alternative assessment which
   can give a clear picture of pupils' learning process and cognitive
   structures to education stakeholders so that appropriate instructional
   strategies can be designed to tailored pupils' needs. Coincide with this
   function, the Ordered Multiple-Choice (OMC) items were incorporated into
   the CDA developed in this study. This paper describes the process of
   developing and validating a Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment with OMC
   items for assessing pupils' attribute mastery on `Addition of Time' and
   reports the psychometric properties of the items, the model-data fit,
   the attribute reliability and the overall reliability of the assessment.
   The sample of the study consisted of 30 Year Four National School (SK)
   pupils, 48 Year Four National-Type Chinese School (SJKC) pupils and 12
   Year Four National-Type Tamil School (SJKT) pupils in Penang state,
   Malaysia. The data was analysed using two measurement models, namely
   Classical Test Theory and Attribute Hierarchy Method (AHM). The findings
   of the study indicated that the instrument developed consisted of
   good-quality OMC items with appropriate difficulty and high
   discrimination power. With the satisfactory model-data fit in AHM, the
   inference made about pupils' attributes mastery based on their
   performance in CDA with OMC items was valid. The CDA with OMC items
   developed in this study was found to be reliable at both attribute level
   and assessment level. Perhaps, this instrument could be used in the
   mathematics classrooms for supporting teachers in diagnosing pupils'
   cognitive strengths and weaknesses for `Addition of Time'.},

Abstract = {Although mentoring has been considered to be important for beginning
   teachers to situate themselves within the school community, only a few
   studies on the opportunities of mentoring and possible difficulties from
   the perceptions of the mentee have been carried out, especially in East
   Asia. In this paper, a study based on a multiple case approach that
   investigated how three early career mathematics teachers from Shanghai
   were mentored is presented. Qualitative text analysis is used to analyse
   interviews with the beginning teachers during their initial two years of
   teaching. Four types of one-to-one mentoring could be identified:
   unnecessary, demonstrative, supportive and collaborative, taking into
   consideration both the mentor's and the mentee's activities during the
   mentoring process as well as the mentee's perception of the
   supportiveness of the mentoring activities. Different opportunities and
   difficulties in the various types of mentoring could be identified,
   offering insight for a possible advancement of research regarding this
   important phase of teachers' professional development.},

Title = {Expressing the Voice of the Textbook-Insights Gained from Tagging

Abstract = {With the growing availability of technology, teachers are becoming
   significant co-designers of the curriculum-resequencing, editing or
   supplementing a primary textbook with publicly available digital
   learning objects. This places a grave responsibility on teachers, who
   must have a clear view of the rationale and didactic intentions of the
   textbook in order to ``re-source{''} it while maintaining its coherence.
   Yet, teachers are seldom provided with means to understand textbooks'
   structure and underlying design principles, particularly at the grain
   size of individual learning objects. We are developing tools to express
   the ``voice{''} of a textbook-one tool for assigning specific metadata
   to learning objects (i.e. ``tagging{''}, sometimes referred to as
   ``coding{''}) and another for analysing the coherence of the textbook
   based on the tagged metadata. In the current study, the 3 pre-calculus
   chapters of a high school textbook were tagged. Based on the tagged
   metadata, we used the second tool to reveal the relative prominence of
   different ``types{''} of tasks, analysed by the categories of metadata.
   We focused on commonalities across taggers to explore the nature of the
   textbook. Triangulating our findings in an interview with the textbook
   author, we show that some patterns in the metadata reflect explicit
   design principles, such as avoiding symbolic representations in tasks
   that open a topic, while others reflect tacit principles-making sense to
   the author though not explicitly intended-such as eliciting
   non-technological student justifications in the topic of derivative. We
   conclude that this methodology offers novel opportunities for the study
   of textbook design.},

Abstract = {To shed light on the value of the area model as a tool to elicit
   pre-service teachers' (PSTs') understanding of fractions and area, we
   explored their understanding of the fractional knowledge and geometric
   measurement knowledge incorporated in the area model by providing PSTs
   area models in anatypicalway. We administered a written questionnaire to
   82 PSTs at a large Midwestern university in the USA. We used an
   inductive content analysis approach, including both qualitative and
   quantitative analyses, to analyze the data. Almost half of the PSTs
   provided incorrect answers and faulty reasoning. We identified two main
   strategies for correct reasoning and five sources of the misconceptions
   embedded in the PSTs' incorrect reasoning. Finally, we drew implications
   from our analysis for designing mathematics methods courses that support
   effective use of area models.},

Title = {Posing New Researchable Questions as a Dynamic Process in Educational

Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that posing new researchable questions in
   educational research is a dynamic process that reflects the field's
   growing understanding of the web of potentially influential factors
   surrounding the examination of a particular phenomenon of interest. We
   illustrate this thesis by drawing on a strand of mathematics education
   research related to students' justification schemes that has evolved
   rapidly during the past few decades. Also, we reflect on the possible
   boundaries of the domain of application of the thesis, and we
   hypothesize that it would apply equally to other strands of educational
   research. To support this hypothesis, we briefly consider how the thesis
   would be applicable in two additional research strands. We conclude by
   elaborating on three important implications of the thesis: (1) as new
   potentially influential factors about the phenomenon of interest are
   identified, findings from past research that had not accounted for those
   factors might prove to be insufficient or be put into question; (2)
   there are increased methodological challenges for researchers as they
   seek to design new studies that pay due regard to research advances
   about all relevant and potentially influential factors surrounding the
   phenomenon of interest; and (3) as a wider range of potentially
   influential factors get discovered and considered about a particular
   phenomenon, research knowledge becomes not only more refined, and
   presumably more accurate, but possibly more fragmented too.},

Abstract = {In linear programming, many students find it difficult to translate a
   verbal description of a problem into a valid mathematical model. To
   better understand this, we examine the existing characteristics of
   college engineering students' errors across linear programming (LP)
   problems. We examined textbooks to identify the types of problems
   typically found in introductory linear programming courses. We then
   developed a comprehensive set of tasks and analyzed students' work to
   create a taxonomy of the errors and issues that students exhibited. From
   our findings, we define four categories of identified error types: (1)
   decision variable errors, (2) variable relationship errors, (3) notation
   errors, and (4) form errors. This study contributes to the research by
   investigating students' work in an area of undergraduate mathematics
   that has not been heavily explored before. Findings suggest specific
   areas of focus for future work in helping students develop their
   understanding of linear programming models and mathematical modeling in
   word problems in general.},

Abstract = {Literacy instruction in science and math in elementary education lays a
   critical foundation for later content literacy development and the
   learning of content subjects in middle and high school. However, limited
   research has investigated the theoretical basis of instructional
   practices for science and math literacy instruction at the elementary
   level. Extending Wright et al., (2016), the present systematic review
   aims to critically examine the connection between theory and practice
   for K-5 science and math literacy instruction. Instructional practices
   recommended in the Reading Teacher, a flagship practitioner-oriented
   journal published by the leading literacy education association,
   International Literacy Association, were analyzed to identify the
   underlying theories. Our findings revealed that most of the science and
   math literacy practices recommended to elementary reading teachers are
   well aligned with social theories, which dominate the field of literacy
   education and conceptualize literacy as a social practice. Following
   social theories of literacy development, students are encouraged to make
   connections between the text and their personal interest and life
   experiences. The current study also revealed gaps between theory and
   practice in elementary science and math literacy instruction, where key
   theories were not or underrepresented in practices. Further
   strengthening the connection between theory and practice requires a
   joint effort between researchers and practitioners.},

Abstract = {Technological literacy (TL) as the goal of technology education guides
   the construction of the technology education curriculum in China.
   Previous studies investigating technological literacy were limited to
   K-12 students and had some ambiguities in the definition of technology,
   theoretical framework, and assessed criterion, and a measurement
   instrument for use among the Chinese public is lacking. To address this
   need, the Technological Literacy Scale for the Chinese Public (TLSCP)
   was developed in this study. Based on DeVore's infrastructure of
   technology and seven taxonomies of technologies proposed by the
   International Technology Education Association, the complexity,
   contents, and components of technology in the TLSCP were ensured.
   Combined with previous dimensions proposed by the National Academy of
   Engineering and the National Research Council and the goal of
   classification in the Chinese High School General Technological
   Curriculum Standards, a new classification of technological literacy
   incorporating technological attitude (TA), technological knowledge (TK),
   and technological capacity (TC) was developed. Through a 4-point
   Likert-type scale, Bloom's Taxonomy of Cognitive Objectives, and
   Quellmalz Taxonomy, the content of the items in the TLSCP can be
   evaluated objectively. Data obtained from 1117 people in 31 provinces
   and municipalities were included in a pilot test investigating the
   reliability, validity, difficulty and discrimination ability of the
   TLSCP. The three dimensions of the TLSCP were reliable {[}TA (alpha =
   0.889), TK (alpha = 0.693), and TC (alpha = 0.726)], the content
   validity was verified by seven experts in the fields of technology
   education, machinery and materials, and psychological assessment, and
   the construct validity (lambda > 0.5) was good. Moreover, the difficulty
   of the items (p between 0.35 and 0.67) was appropriate, and item
   discrimination (r(pb) between 0.30 and 0.67) was acceptable. The TLSCP
   was useful for addressing the deficiencies in TL measurement instruments
   in China and improving the theoretical basis of international TL
   evaluations. It may be a good template for others who want to develop
   such an instrument in a different culture.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to contribute to the discussion of
   mathematics teacher knowledge, and the question of what makes it
   specialized. In the first part of the article, central orientations in
   conceptualizing mathematics teacher knowledge are identified and the
   more serious limitations of the grounds on which they stand are
   explicated. In the second part of the article, alternative views are
   offered to each of these orientations that direct attention to
   underexplored issues about what makes mathematics teacher knowledge
   specialized. Collectively, these alternative views suggest that
   specialization in mathematics teacher knowledge cannot be
   comprehensively accounted for by what' teachers know, but rather by how'
   teachers' knowing comes into being. We conclude that it is not a kind of
   knowledge but a style of knowing that signifies specialization in
   mathematics teacher knowledge.},

Abstract = {This study shows how, in the initial training of mathematics teachers,
   it is possible to promote processes of abstraction and mathematisation
   through modelling a real situation with the support of auxiliary
   material to mediate understanding. By adapting elements of the
   theoretical and methodological framework called Abstraction in Context
   (AiC), participants' discussions while building a mathematical modelin a
   nested epistemic actionsare analysed. Two specific points are discussed
   in this paper. The first aims to identify how different types of
   knowledge emerge when an individual is faced with a modelling task. The
   second is regarding the use of auxiliary material as a means of
   metaphorising a situation. It was evidenced how the material favours the
   construction of a mathematical model through the simplification and
   idealisation that it brings. The meaning constructed for the model is
   supported in recognising a decreasing behaviour as a part of a whole.},

Abstract = {Through the lenses of statistical investigations and cognitive demands,
   we examined bivariate data tasks offered in US high school mathematics
   textbook seriesa popular representative of three curriculum types:
   traditional, integrated, and hybrid. We developed a framework grounded
   in literature of association topics for the inclusion and exclusion of
   tasks. Using the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction of Statistics
   Education (GAISE) framework, textbook tasks were coded for four
   investigation components (formulate questions, collect data, analyze
   data, and interpret results) and levels of statistical sophistication,
   as well as levels of cognitive demand as suggested by the Mathematical
   Complexity framework. Across the three series 582 statistical
   association tasks, all components of statistical investigation were
   evident with different levels of treatment: (a) all questions for
   statistical investigations were provided by textbook authors; (b) tasks
   rarely afforded student opportunities to collect data; and (c) nearly
   all of the tasks required students to analyze data and most required
   them to interpret results. Tasks in the integrated series were more
   numerous (n=246) and required higher levels of mathematical complexity
   and statistical sophistication than tasks in the traditional and hybrid
   series. The vast majority of tasks were coded at the GAISE Level B for
   analyze data and interpret results and moderate level for mathematical
   complexity. Further analyses show the concordance between the
   developmental levels for statistical sophistication and mathematical
   complexity. Suggestions for curriculum development, content analysis,
   and future research are provided.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how students' reasoning contributes to their
   utilization of computer-generated feedback. Sixteen 16-year-old students
   solved a linear function task designed to present a challenge to them
   using dynamic software, GeoGebra, for assistance. The data were analysed
   with respect both to character of reasoning and to the use of feedback
   generated through activities in GeoGebra. The results showed that
   students who successfully solved the task were engaged in creative
   reasoning and used feedback extensively.},

Title = {Will Teachers Create Opportunities for Discussion when Teaching Proof in
   a Geometry Classroom?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {This study presents an analysis of whether geometry teachers create
   opportunities for student discussion when engaging students in proving
   as revealed through the use of a multimedia survey instrument. We
   presented 42 secondary mathematics teachers with 8 multimedia narratives
   set in the situation of doing proofs in high school geometry and asked
   them to choose what they would do next, presenting options that included
   a normative instructional action which closed off discussion and less
   typical actions that encouraged student discussion. Our analysis
   provides insight into the professional obligations that teachers use to
   justify their departure from the norm in order to encourage student talk
   as well as the background variables that are associated with such
   decisions. We found that while secondary mathematics teachers frequently
   chose to promote discussion in their classrooms, the rationale that they
   chose for this decision and the reasons they might choose not to
   immediately encourage discussion differed according to the amount of
   experience they had teaching geometry. We use these differences to
   illustrate how the professional obligations can be used to better
   understand how teacher decisions are rationalized at the level of the
   instructional situation.},

Abstract = {The expert blind spot (EBS) hypothesis implies that even some experts
   with a high content knowledge might have problems in science
   communication because they are using the structure of the content rather
   than their addressee's prerequisites as an orientation. But is that also
   true for students? Explaining science to peers is a crucial part of
   cooperative learning methods such as the ``jigsaw method{''}. Our study
   examined the relationship between science communication competence (SCC)
   and content knowledge (CK) of 10th-grade students (N = 213). Using
   latent class analysis, we identified two types of students with a
   different relationship between CK and SCC. Using path analysis, we found
   that the first type of 109 students primarily used their science CK as
   the ``resource{''} for addressee-oriented science communication and both
   their SCC and their CK were correlated with each other. For the second
   type of 104 students (who used other resources), their CK even had a
   small negative effect on their SCC. Using t tests, we found that those
   students primarily using their CK as the resource for communication
   performed significantly worse in the communication test than did those
   students who used other resources. Using the EBS hypothesis, we suggest
   that students' CK might have ambiguous effects in communication if the
   content structure-rather than their addressee's prior knowledge-is used
   as the primary orientation for communication. We suggest that an
   effective use of cooperative learning techniques in classroom requires a
   special prior training for their science communication skills.},

Abstract = {This article reports on two professional development programs for
   mathematics teachers and their effects on student achievement. The
   projects' design and their implementation within a larger municipality
   in Sweden, working together with over 90 teachers and 5000 students in
   elementary school, are described by using a set of core critical
   features of teacher professional development as identified in the
   research literature. Data on student achievement were collected at the
   beginning of the projects as well as one year after their
   implementation. The results demonstrate a significant interaction effect
   between year and intervention for grades 2, 8, and 9. Upon a closer
   examination of the descriptive statistics, the first project points at
   slight improvements for students in grade 2, while the results for
   grades 8 and 9 indicate a declining trend. The results for the second
   project are markedly different and indicate an improvement for student
   achievement in grades 8 and 9, while the results for grade 2 suggest a
   deterioration. Considering that both projects are conducted within the
   same context and are very similar when it comes to several of the
   critical features of professional development as identified in the
   research literature, these variances in results are noteworthy.
   Therefore, building on a closer examination of the projects' critical
   features, the Swedish educational context, and results from teacher
   evaluations, the article ends with a discussion of possible explanations
   for the variations found between, as well as within, the two projects'
   differing impact on student achievement.},

Abstract = {The concepts and instruments required for the teaching and learning of
   geometric optics are introduced in the didactic process without a proper
   didactic transposition. This claim is secured by the ample evidence of
   both wide-and deep-rooted alternative concepts on the topic. Didactic
   transposition is a theory that comes from a reflection on the teaching
   and learning process in mathematics but has been used in other
   disciplinary fields. It will be used in this work in order to clear up
   the main obstacles in the teaching-learning process of geometric optics.
   We proceed to argue that since Newton's approach to optics, in his Book
   I of Opticks, is independent of the corpuscular or undulatory nature of
   light, it is the most suitable for a constructivist learning
   environment. However, Newton's theory must be subject to a proper
   didactic transposition to help overcome the referred alternative
   concepts. Then is described our didactic transposition in order to
   create knowledge to be taught using a dialogical process between
   students' previous knowledge, history of optics and the desired outcomes
   on geometrical optics in an elementary pre-service teacher training
   course. Finally, we use the scheme-facet structure of knowledge both to
   analyse and discuss our results as well as to illuminate shortcomings
   that must be addressed in our next stage of the inquiry.},

Abstract = {Scientific literacy (SL) and critical thinking (CT) are key components
   of science education aiming to prepare students to think and to function
   as responsible citizens in a world increasingly affected by science and
   technology (S\&T). Therefore, students should be given opportunities in
   their science classes to be engaged in learning experiences that promote
   SL and CT, which may trigger the need to build and develop knowledge,
   attitudes/values, thinking abilities, and standards/criteria in an
   integrated way, resulting in their ability to know how to take
   responsible action in contexts and situations of personal and social
   relevance. This paper reports on a study to design, implement, and
   assess science learning experiences focused on CT toward SL goal.
   Results support the conclusion that the learning experiences developed
   and implemented in a grade 6 science classroom had a significant
   influence on the students' CT and SL. Within this elementary school
   context, the theoretical framework used appears to be a relevant and
   practical aid for developing learning experiences that promote CT/SL and
   in supporting teaching practices that are more in line with the goals of
   critical scientific literacy.},

Abstract = {It remains difficult to foster problem-solving and
   mathematical-reasoning capabilities in classrooms where students and
   teachers are accustomed to the more traditional forms of education.
   Several studies suggest that this difficulty might be related to the
   kind of knowledge students acquire in such environments, which could be
   fragmented and superficial. In our research, we developed specific tasks
   that might improve student's learning and consequently the kind of
   knowledge when used in small group work. The learning process we aimed
   at in this setting is directed at strengthening, grounding and
   integrating students' fragmented and pseudo-mathematical knowledge. We
   called the lessons in this approach-shift-problem lessons-and we
   investigated the effect of learning arrangements that replace some of
   the regular lessons with shift-problem lessons. We conducted two
   quasi-experimental studies: one in geometric proof and another in
   integral calculus with 16/17-year-old students in pre-university
   education. Each study involved three experimental classrooms and three
   comparable classrooms. The results indicate that the learning
   arrangement seems to have a positive influence on the students'
   performance as the experimental group outperformed the control group in
   particular tasks. We also found that, with regard to small group work in
   the shift-problem lessons, the groups of students' success in solving
   the tasks throughout the course followed different patterns in the
   integral calculus and geometric-proof courses. These results and the
   implications of the study for mathematics educators and researchers are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the kinds of reasoning that
   African American young men learn and develop when playing Spades, a
   common cultural practice in African American communities. The
   qualitative study found that the Spades players routinely consider
   multiple variables and their mathematical relationships when making
   decisions. The variables considered by the players when bidding include
   card strength, the number of cards held in any particular suit, player
   bidding tendencies, player levels of expertise, the current score of the
   game, and the level of confidence in one's partner. The paper claims
   that the forms of reasoning explored in this study connect well to those
   of scientists who engage in modeling: a central practice in science. A
   major implication is that model-based instruction in science classrooms
   is akin to cultural modeling (Lee in American Educational Research
   Journal, 38(1), 97-141, 2001), as the pedagogy leverages the assets and
   resources of African American young men learned through cultural
   practice. Such pedagogies could therefore have a positive effect upon
   engagement and achievement of African American young men in science.},

Abstract = {Several researches in physics education have demonstrated the
   problematic status of teaching the subject of gravitation and weight and
   students' knowledge of these concepts. This paper presents findings of a
   study of students' knowledge following instruction within a changed
   conceptual framework of the weight concept in several 9th grade classes
   (N = 141). The experimental instruction addressed a representative set
   of physical situations designed to facilitate students' construction of
   adequate knowledge regarding weight and gravitational force. We checked
   the ability of middle school students to distinguish between these two
   concepts and the effectiveness of the operational definition of weight
   in helping students to account for novel physical situations. A written
   open-format qualitative questionnaire was used in the assessment that
   analyzed the data by means of quantitative (statistical) and qualitative
   (scheme-facets) tools. The same questionnaire was applied to 91 high
   school students exposed to the advanced placement level of teaching of
   the subject of gravitation and weight in Israeli schools. The results
   indicated an advantage of the experimental teaching with regard to
   students' pertinent conceptual knowledge.},

Abstract = {In the subject matter of functional relationships, a student's ability
   to translate from one form of representation to another is seen as a
   central competence. In the course of the HEUREKO project (heuristic work
   with representations of functional relationships and the diagnosis of
   mathematical competencies of students), a theoretical competence
   structure model comprising five competence dimensions was developed.
   These are based on four types of representation (graph, numerical table,
   algebraic equation and situational description) and correspond to the
   skill to translate from one type of representation to another. The
   following study was aimed to examine the facets of the model. The
   5-dimensional model was empirically tested with a sample of N = 645
   students of grades 9 and 10. This was accomplished by comparing
   competing item response models with regard to model fit using
   information criteria measures. In comparison with other possible model
   structures, our postulated 5-dimensional model showed the best model
   fit, suggesting that all translations are relevant for competence
   assessment and development. Furthermore, in order to allow for the
   identification of structural components of cognitive actions, the
   employed tasks used in the empirical testing were divided into
   categories with regard to the different demands of cognitive action. Our
   results suggest that cognitive actions may have a specific dimensional
   structure. These findings can contribute to a better diagnostic approach
   concerning specific strengths and weaknesses and can therefore foster
   students' competencies.},

Abstract = {Most studies of students' understanding of decimals have been conducted
   within Western cultural settings. The broad aim of the present research
   was to gain insight into Chinese Hong Kong grade 6 students' general
   performance on a variety of decimals tasks. More specifically, the study
   aimed to explore students' mathematical reasoning for their use of
   `rules' and algorithms and to determine whether connections exist
   between students' conceptual and procedural knowledge when completing
   decimals tasks. Results indicated that conceptual understanding for
   rules and procedures were built into the students' knowledge system for
   most of the items concerned with place value in decimals-ordering
   decimals, translating fractions into decimals, the representation of
   place value in decimals, the concept of place value in decimals on
   number line and the concept of continuous quantity in decimals. However,
   the students were not able to provide such clear explanations for the
   use of algorithms for the multiplication and division items. The
   findings are discussed in the light of Chinese perspectives on
   procedural and conceptual understanding.},

Abstract = {Equation rearrangement is an important skill required for problem
   solving in mathematics and science. Eye movements of 40 university
   students were recorded while they were rearranging simple algebraic
   equations. The participants also reported on their strategies during
   equation solving in a separate questionnaire. The analysis of the
   behavioral and eye tracking data, namely the accuracy, reaction times,
   and the number of fixations, revealed that the participants improved
   their performance during the time course of the measurement. The type of
   equation also had a significant effect on the score. The results
   indicated that the number of fixations represents a reliable and
   sensitive measure that can give valuable insights into participants'
   flow of attention during equation solving. A correlation between the
   number of fixations and participants' efficiency in equation solving was
   found, suggesting that the more efficient participants developed
   adequate strategies, i.e. ``knew where to look.{''} The comparison of
   eye movement data and questionnaire reports was used for assessing the
   validity of participants' metacognitive insights. The measures derived
   from eye movement data were found to be more objective and reliable than
   the participants' reports. These results indicate that the measurement
   of eye movements provides insights into otherwise unavailable cognitive
   processes and may be used for exploring problem difficulty, student
   expertise, and metacognitive processes.},

Abstract = {For nearly 50 years, leaders in American industry, military, education,
   and politics have focused considerable attention on STEM (science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics) education. Given the increased
   societal demand for STEM careers, the relationships among classroom
   climate, self-efficacy, and achievement in undergraduate mathematics
   needed to be examined. A purposeful sample of college algebra
   instructors (n = 15), employed at public 4-year universities in various
   states (n = 10) across the nation, was administered the Principles of
   Adult Learning Scale at the beginning of the semester to assess
   classroom climate. At the end of the course semester, their college
   algebra students (n = 326) were administered the Mathematics
   Self-Efficacy Scale-Revised and final college algebra examinations. The
   results of the multi-level analysis indicated: (a) students having
   higher mathematics self-efficacy also had higher mathematics
   achievement, (b) teacher-centered classroom climates had greater
   mathematics self-efficacy levels, (c) classroom climate was not a
   significant predictor of mathematics achievement, (c) classroom climate
   did not moderate the relationship between mathematics self-efficacy and
   achievement, and (d) although boys reported higher mathematics
   self-efficacy than girls, gender differences were not found to exist in
   regard to mathematics achievement.},

Abstract = {Much has been said and written about indigenous knowledge systems (IKS)
   or, as it is also termed, traditional ecological knowledge. My paper
   does not intend to discuss how it should be termed, although this is
   also an important issue as the way we name it frames the possibilities
   we open for this kind of knowledge. The paper rather looks historically
   at indigenous knowledge inclusion in school curricula, taking as an
   example the practice in Mozambique. So far, many strategies in so-called
   culturally inclusive science curricula tend to take students along the
   pathway of cultural assimilation by integrating IKS into World Modern
   Science topics. IKS is therefore taken as an instrument for serving the
   goals of World Modern Science. I argue that we need to find legitimated
   theories to integrate IKS in order to counteract the practice of
   teaching IKS in science classrooms detached from its own sociocultural
   context.},

Abstract = {Teachers' curricular role identities are those dimensions of their
   professional identities concerned with the use of curriculum materials.
   In a previous study, we developed and tested a survey instrument
   designed to measure preservice elementary teachers' development of
   curricular role identity for science teaching through their use of
   science curriculum materials. In this follow-up study, a revised version
   of the survey was administered to a second group of preservice
   elementary teachers in the same science methods course, and data were
   analyzed within and across years. Results from this study suggest that
   preservice teachers articulated important similarities and differences
   between the curricular role identities for science teaching they
   attributed to themselves and to more experienced elementary teachers.
   Over time, they were often able to begin to appropriate the curricular
   role identities for science teaching that they attributed to more
   experienced elementary teachers. However, findings from the second
   survey administration also suggest that preservice teachers' curricular
   role identities for science teaching are more stable when characterized
   by their actual curriculum design practices than when characterized by
   comparative, probabilistic means. These findings have important
   implications for science teacher education and curriculum development,
   as well as the operationalization of curricular role identity in
   education research.},

Abstract = {Tools are needed to track the elements of students' successful
   engagement in inquiry. The McGill Strategic Demands of Inquiry
   Questionnaire (MSDIQ) is a 79-item, criterion-referenced,
   learner-focused questionnaire anchored in Schon's model and related
   models of self-regulated learning. The MSDIQ addresses three phases of
   inquiry engagement-planning, enactment, reflection-perceived as
   important by teachers, parents, and students before or after inquiry
   participation. Internal consistency and validity evidence was obtained
   from 205 university students with different inquiry backgrounds: teacher
   education years 1 and 4, continuing teacher education, and honors
   psychology. Separate confirmatory factor analyses of planning,
   enactment, and reflection generated 14 intercorrelated factors congruent
   with definitions of inquiry instruction and supported the hypothesized
   structure underlying the MSDIQ as a reliable and valid instrument for
   measuring inquiry engagement and valuing its building blocks.},

Abstract = {Students' concerns about mathematics can significantly affect their
   ability to learn the subject. In particular, their anxieties and
   attitudes can greatly affect how they perceive their own mathematical
   competence, and in return, this may make them reluctant to pursue
   mathematical studies. Many researchers believe in the role of active
   learning environments in reshaping students' perception of and emotions
   about mathematics. This paper reports the results of an investigation on
   the effect of one such environment. As a result of being exposed to an
   active learning environment, a group of 21 cohort students showed
   opinion changes from a pre- to post-survey statements significantly on
   emotion and noticeably on confidence and perception statements. There
   was, however, no statistically significant change observed on the
   opinions of a group of 41 traditional students.},

Abstract = {As people attempt to make sense of the world, they develop personal
   knowledge structures. These structures often contain
   misconceptions-inaccurate or incomplete information-that are highly
   resistant to change because existing knowledge networks must be
   restructured to accommodate counterintuitive information in a process
   known as conceptual change. Since textbooks are the dominant resource
   for science instruction in most classrooms, text-based methods of
   facilitating conceptual change need to be examined. Since the mid-1980
   s, researchers have investigated the conceptual change potential of
   refutation text, a text structure that includes elements of
   argumentation and that has been described as one of the most effective
   text-based means for modifying readers' misconceptions. In this paper,
   twenty years of refutation text research in science and reading
   education is reviewed and then a secondary analysis of those results is
   conducted to explore developmental aspects of the efficacy of refutation
   text. Although a developmental relationship was not revealed, two
   decades of research indicate that reading refutation text rather than
   traditional expository text is more likely to result in conceptual
   change.},

Abstract = {Ancient Chinese mathematics has been the focus of many research studies
   and scholarly works from a historical perspective. However, no move has
   been made to investigate its role in the teaching and learning of
   mathematics. This pilot study examined the effects of an Ancient Chinese
   Mathematics Enrichment Programme (ACMEP) on the academic achievement of
   second year students from a secondary school in Singapore-a strand of a
   principal study which had the intent of investigating possible roles of
   ancient Chinese mathematics in the Singapore secondary school
   mathematics curriculum. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the
   difference in mean scores on a variety of formal assessments in
   mathematics between students who participated in the ACMEP and those who
   did not. In addition, scores on formal assessments of other relevant
   subjects were analyzed to further investigate ACMEP's scope of
   influence.},

Abstract = {This study provides analyses of the conversations when university
   students work in small groups solving context-rich physics problems. We
   constructed context-rich, open-ended physics problems related to
   everyday life situations that lack some information required to solve
   and complete the tasks. The students' ownership of learning, their
   actions of choice and control, was analyzed in two dimensions: group and
   individual. Conversation analyses and flowcharts of the conversation
   were constructed from the complete transcripts of three groups. The
   theoretical framework for student ownership of learning demonstrated
   that it was possible to show that even if students have group ownership
   of the task, the individual student ownership of learning is not
   self-evident. The study also demonstrates the methodological power and
   value of the flowchart to identify conversation patterns in the groups
   that were effective in the search for exploratory talks and individual
   questions. We discuss implications for teacher development to enhance
   group work.},

Title = {Scientist-School STEM Partnerships Through Outreach in the USA: A
   Systematic Review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 3},
Abstract = {This systematic review investigated the literature between 1990-2021 to
   identify trends regarding science, technology, engineering, and math
   (STEM) scientists conducting K-12 outreach. The review identified 50
   publications that reflected the scholarship on scientist-led K-12
   outreach. This includes literature on the effective strategies regarding
   scientists' outreach efforts and how scientist-teacher partnerships
   could be improved for more meaningful and impactful K-12 outreach. In
   addition to best practice recommendations, this review revealed patterns
   in outreach participants and barriers to effective scientist-teacher
   partnerships. The results of this study suggest that there is a need for
   more rigorous and published scholarship on scientist-led K-12 outreach
   so that scientists and K-12 stakeholders can better understand the best
   practices and barriers related to outreach. Additionally, the review
   calls for better integration of the perspectives of educators into

Abstract = {Internationally, there are concerns that more needs to be done to
   address the inequalities in participation in science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects at the degree level. In
   response, research focused on better understanding what influences young
   people's STEM participation has focused on a range of factors. This
   paper contributes to the existing research with an analysis of how
   ``science capital{''} and ``STEM identity{''} relate to STEM
   participation. We draw on data from 3310 young people aged 21-22 who had
   undertaken an undergraduate degree, 523 of whom studied a STEM subject.
   We found that science capital and STEM identity were statistically
   significantly related to studying a STEM degree (with science capital
   being weakly and STEM identity strongly associated with STEM study at
   university). Adopting a Bourdieusian lens, we discuss what our findings
   mean for higher education and what more could be done to support
   students, especially those who are currently under-represented in STEM,
   such as through better recognising and developing their science capital
   and supporting their sense of belonging in STEM.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore how a research-informed product, a
   hypothetical learning trajectory (HLT), was implemented by a group of
   Shanghai teachers in mathematics classrooms and promoted by a researcher
   through a Chinese lesson study. The instruction informed by the HLT
   served as a boundary object to promote conversations between the
   researcher and the teachers. The researcher played an indispensable role
   as a broker to facilitate the transformation of the boundary object. A
   fine-grained analysis of the data set showed that the team of teachers
   and the researcher formed a boundary encounter between teaching and
   research communities in which the participants negotiated and agreed on
   HLT-informed instruction. The study identified four turning points that
   are crucial for transforming HLT-informed instruction from an abstract
   object to a concrete form. Based on the turning points, we revealed the
   role played by the researcher as a broker in this lesson study. Finally,
   the challenges of bringing HLT into the classroom are discussed.},

Abstract = {Teacher scaffolding is crucial to promote students' cooperative learning
   processes, but little is known about the cognitive attention underlying
   teachers' scaffolding behavior. This study aims to investigate the
   scaffolding behavior teachers exhibit while intervening in students'
   cooperative learning and to explore the relation between teachers'
   scaffolding behavior and visual perception when applying supportive
   strategies. Four secondary teachers in China were studied during
   mathematics lessons using eye-tracking glasses complemented by an
   additional classroom camera with interviews. The results show that the
   teachers applied scaffolding strategies very often, followed by the
   usage of diagnostic strategies. Furthermore, they were more concerned
   about the cognitive aspects of students' learning processes than the
   social aspects. The applied strategies were significantly related to
   fixation patterns during scaffolding. Detailed analysis suggests that
   (1) the teachers diagnosed students' understanding mainly by observing
   the material with an attention or scan pattern; (2) during scaffolding
   processes, when applying a cognitive performance strategy, teachers paid
   attention to both the students and their material; (3) while regulating
   cognitive processes, most teachers scanned students' material quickly;
   and (4) teachers generally focused more on materials to provide
   interaction-related help than on students' facial expressions.
   Additionally, the study points out that teachers' perception skills and
   behaviors during class activities may be influenced by the task being
   performed, teachers' teaching experience, and their beliefs.},

Abstract = {Implemented was a 45-minute per day Primary Science IDEAS intervention
   in grades 1-2 integrating reading and writing within science instruction
   in a multi-year study conducted in 8 experimental and 9 control schools.
   Results found a significant direct achievement effect in grades 1-2 on
   both the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) Science and Reading. In
   addition, the direct effect of the intervention in grades 1-2 also
   resulted in significant achievement transfer from grades 1-2 to grade 3
   on both the ITBS Science and Reading. Discussed are policy implications
   of the findings for increasing instructional time allocated to science
   in grades 1-2 and expanding the focus of grade 1-2 student achievement
   assessment to include content-area learning.},

Title = {Beyond Keywords: Applying Systemic Functional Linguistics to Unpack the

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Number = {SUPPL 1, 1, SI},

Abstract = {The learning of mathematics poses specific linguistic challenges.
   Amongst them, teachers and students need to be able to unpack the
   language used in mathematics word problems to understand its context,
   discern the relationships between the known and unknown information, and
   identify relevant solution strategies. Prior research has described some
   of the linguistic complexities within the math discipline. However,
   research has not yet examined the linguistic patterns of additive
   problem types in particular, nor explored how linguistic analysis might
   be applied to support prospective elementary teachers in making sense of
   these problems. Using a corpus of 400 word problems, the authors
   conducted an ideation analysis, drawing from Systemic Functional
   Linguistics theory. The findings resulted in a distillation of language
   features key to conveying the mathematical meanings in the three types
   of additive problems (i.e., change, part-part-whole, and additive
   comparison). Prospective elementary teachers were introduced to
   linguistic functional metalanguage as a tool for analyzing the key
   language features in additive word problems. Analysis of their work
   demonstrated their ability to employ the functional metalanguage to
   identify challenges and describe specific linguistic characteristics
   associated with each type of additive problem.},

Title = {High School Students' Use of Diagrams in Geometry Proofs},

Abstract = {In high school geometry, proving theorems and applying them to geometry
   problems is an expectation for students. An essential part of most
   geometry proofs is the diagram because it not only helps encapsulate the
   claim being proved but can also be a tool in reasoning or communicating
   an argument. This interview-based study investigated how high school
   students interpret and use diagrams during the process of proving
   geometric claims. Particular attention is given to the semiotic
   resources such as symbols, visuals, and gestures that students employ in
   relation to the diagrams. Study participants were nine students from
   grades 10 to 12 and data was collected through one-on-one task-based
   clinical interviews with tasks that varied with regard to diagrammatic
   features. The findings suggest that, in general, some visual resources
   such as drawing a new figure occurred regularly in particular tasks such
   as tasks that did not adhere to the typical diagrammatic register or
   that had unknown truth values. Gesturing with justifications were the
   most frequently used proving actions in all tasks. Moreover, in all
   valid proof arguments produced by students, they engaged in all three
   semiotic resources (symbols, visuals, and gestures).},

Abstract = {This study, in which the explanatory mixed design was used, has two
   aims. The first aim is the development of a scale to determine teachers'
   beliefs about the integration of mathematics and children's literature.
   The second one is to examine the beliefs of teachers on children's
   literature and mathematics teaching, with the data collected through the
   scale. The items of the scale developed within the scope of the study
   were created based on the literature and the opinions of 56 teachers who
   were aware of this topic (phase 1). The draft scale was applied to 392
   teachers. After the validity and reliability studies, the scale was
   finalized. Accordingly, the scale has four dimensions and 33 items:
   positive pedagogical effects of the integration, the role of resources
   influencing the integration process, teacher competencies that make the
   integration process difficult and social norms, and teacher competencies
   that facilitate the integration process (phase 2). The data were
   collected from 772 pre-school, primary, and middle school teachers
   (phase 3) to reveal teachers' beliefs about the mathematics and
   children's literature integration through the final form of the scale.
   The results indicate that pre-school teachers have much higher scores in
   contrast to the primary and middle school teachers except for the
   dimension of the role of resources influencing the integration process,
   and novice teachers have more positive beliefs about the positive
   pedagogical effects of integration and their competencies in this
   regard. Also, the beliefs about the integration process significantly
   vary based on the awareness levels about integration.},

Abstract = {Science fiction (SF) combines realistic and imaginary elements of
   science and technology and develops students' imagination, creativity,
   and interest in science. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine
   SF stories written by pre-service science teachers (PSTs) in terms of
   various textual and science variables. The case study of SF story
   writing aimed to develop a theoretical framework to analyze how
   narrative elements, plot structure, agency, the nature of science
   content, characteristics of the SF genre, and ethics in scientific
   research are included in the stories of a group of Turkish PSTs. The
   participants of the study were 58 pre-service teachers enrolled in the
   science education department at a public university in Turkey. Working
   in groups, they wrote 13 different SF stories. The stories were analyzed
   with a rubric including two parts: narrative and other story elements
   and the characteristics of the SF genre. The results showed that the
   stories included fictional and realistic features of science and
   technology, scientific concepts, and details about scientific realities.
   The stories addressed the social and cultural embeddedness of scientific
   knowledge and details about the scientific method. However, the
   originality is limited in many stories as they had traces from popular
   movies, books, and TV series. The stories did consider a range of

Abstract = {Research focusing on the integration of computational thinking (CT) into
   science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education
   started to emerge. We conducted a semi-systematic literature review on
   55 empirical studies on this topic. Our findings include: (a) the
   majority of the studies adopted domain-general definitions of CT and a
   few proposed domain-specific CT definitions in STEM education; (b) the
   most popular instructional model was problem-based instruction, and the
   most popular topic contexts included game design, robotics, and
   computational modelling; (c) while the assessments of student learning
   in integrated CT and STEM education targeted different objectives with
   different formats, about a third of them assessed integrated CT and
   STEM; (d) about a quarter of the studies reported differential learning
   processes and outcomes between groups, but very few of them investigated
   how pedagogical design could improve equity. Based on the findings,
   suggestions for future research and practice in this field are discussed
   in terms of operationalizing and assessing CT in STEM contexts,
   instructional strategies for integrating CT in STEM, and research for
   broadening participation in integrated CT and STEM education.},

Abstract = {Research has identified some sources of student difficulty in
   understanding the horizontal translation of a function. The present
   study presents and focuses on another source for the difficulties:
   student conceptions of symbols involved in the horizontal translation of
   the graph of a function. We explored which student conceptions of the
   symbols f, x, and y are problematic or supportive in finding the
   equation of the translated graph when a given graph of y = f(x) is
   translated -2 units horizontally. For example, student conceptions of x
   as a general label for any point on the x-axis or as an independent
   variable of only a given original function emerged as problematic, while
   a conception of x as an independent variable of a function to describe
   was supportive. It seemed crucial for students to recruit some
   background ideas about horizontal translation in order to activate the
   supportive conceptions of f, x, and y and make them powerful. Our study
   suggests that horizontal translation of the graph of a function provides
   an opportunity for students to reflect on their prior conceptions of f,
   x, and y and restructure the conceptions to be comprehensive.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how three widely used calculus textbooks realise
   integrals as a potential to prompt mathematical competencies, adapting
   the rating scheme used in Boesen et al. (The Journal of Mathematical
   Behavior, 33:72-87, 2014), Pettersen and Braeken (International Journal
   of Science and Mathematics Education, 17(2):405-425, 2019) and Turner,
   Blum and Niss (2015). For this purpose, the study analysed examples (n =
   444) about integrals-specifically, to assess the extent to which solving
   those examples calls for the activation of a particular set of
   mathematical competencies: Communication; Devising Strategies;
   Mathematising; Representation; Using Symbols, Operations and Formal
   Language {[}Symbols and Formalism]; Reasoning and Argument. The
   competency demand of the examples was also identified on a scale from 0
   (lowest demand) to 3 (highest demand) for each of six mathematical
   competencies. The findings revealed substantial similarities among the
   three calculus textbooks with regard to the level of competency demands:
   high level of Communication and Symbols and Formalism and low level of
   Devising Strategies, Representation, Reasoning and Argument and
   Mathematising. Relationships between these findings, implementations and
   future research directions are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of teachers' conceptions of and competency in
   problem solving, limited attention is given to this area in the current
   literature. We examined 96 preservice elementary teachers'
   problem-solving conceptions and performances by having them define and
   create metaphors for problem solving and then investigated the
   relationships between their conceptions and problem-solving
   performances. We found that a large majority defined problem solving as
   a means to a solution and created end-product metaphors and that their
   conceptions of problem solving were related to their performances. This
   study contributes to the current literature on problem solving and the
   knowledge base of teacher education.},

Abstract = {Integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   curricula have taken center stage in the recent education reforms.
   However, the challenge in teaching STEM curricula lies in finding ways
   to develop students' content knowledge and plan suitable learning
   activities and instructional strategies. This paper is focused on the
   implementation of STEM curricula by secondary technology and engineering
   teachers and presents a framework for implementing a STEM curriculum
   centered on engineering design while illuminating its components, such
   as curriculum theme, content knowledge, learning activities, and
   teaching strategies. As an effective STEM teaching strategy relies on
   content integration, the focal point of this framework is the use of
   learning activities, such as ``inquiry and experiment{''} and ``design
   and making,{''} to integrate STEM content into lessons and help students
   develop core competencies through engineering design processes. This
   paper is meant to serve as a reference for technology and engineering
   educators to use when designing and implementing engineering-oriented
   STEM curricula, thereby providing a deeper learning experience of
   engineering design and STEM integration in secondary-school classrooms.},

Abstract = {As migration is an important social phenomenon, the present study
   analyzes the influence of migration on migrant students' performance in
   mathematics. In a secondary analysis of data from Program for
   International Student Assessment 2012 (PISA), the mathematics
   achievements of students from three top-performing East Asian
   metropolitan areas were examined with reference to their migration
   backgrounds. The findings show that there is a close relation between
   the migration policy of the receiving system and the mathematics
   achievements of migrant students, with the migrant status being of
   advantage in one case (Singapore) and of disadvantage in two cases
   (Shanghai and Hong Kong SAR). These results suggest that it is important
   to separate the different types of migrants while relating these types
   with the corresponding migration policies of the receiving system and
   the mathematics achievement.},

Title = {Student Reasoning About the Lever Principle Through Multimodal
   Representations: a Socio-Semiotic Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {There is increasing recognition of the multimodal representational
   nature of science discovery practices and the roles of multiple and
   multimodal representations in students' meaning making in science
   (Lemke,1998; Tytler, Prain, Hubber, \& Waldrip,2013; Tang,International
   Journal of Science Education, 38(13), 2069-2095,2016). However, research
   in this area is only starting to explore how these different modal
   meanings interact (Tytler, Prain, Aranda, Ferguson, \& Gorur,2020) and
   particularly of the nature of the `transduction' (Airey \&
   Linder,Journal of Research in Science Teaching: The Official Journal of
   the National Association for Research in Science Teaching,46(1),
   27-49,2009) or `re-description' (Lehrer \& Schauble,2013) of one modal
   representation to another and their coordination in model-based
   reasoning in science. This paper explores ways in which groups of
   secondary students orchestrated multimodal representations to gain an
   understanding of the lever principle in a collaborative learning
   environment of a Science of Learning Research Classroom. The analysis of
   video data and student artefacts suggests that mathematical formulations
   on their own were limited in allowing students to satisfactorily engage
   with science ideas and that a key feature of cross-modal translation is
   the flexibility in application of these ideas afforded by the different
   modes and understanding the nature of these interactions. Using a
   Peircean socio-semiotic approach (Peirce,1992,1998) and Pickering's
   notion of scientific research involving a `mangle of practice'
   (Pickering,1995, p. 23), this paper argues that a robust understanding
   of the lever principle necessarily involves students coordinating a
   range of modal representations, including visual-spatial, manipulative,
   embodied and abstract mathematical drawing on the distinctive
   affordances each brings to learning. We also describe the way these
   representations push back on learners in unexpected ways.},

Abstract = {STEM integration has often been recommended as a way to support students
   to develop twenty-first century skills needed to function in the complex
   modern world. In order for students to experience integration, however,
   their teachers need support in designing, developing and implementing
   integrated curricular instruction, which is often at odds with a very
   subject-focused educational system. This paper reports on the second
   year of a research study conducted with five secondary science and
   mathematics teachers, concerned with supporting them to teach explicitly
   the mathematics components within science lessons, mediated via
   technology. It outlines how the teachers collaborated with the support
   of science and mathematics education researchers within a community of
   practice, named a Teaching and Learning Network (TLN). The network was
   intended to promote and enhance teacher capacity for the
   interdisciplinary teaching of mathematics in science in the face of
   various contextual and other obstacles observed in the first year of the
   study. This study found that the opportunity to work in a Teaching and
   Learning Network supported the teachers' ownership of the design of the
   integrated learning unit, enhanced their content knowledge of
   mathematics, their use of the data logging technology and their
   understanding of an inquiry-based pedagogical approach. Participation in
   the TLN provided teachers with the mechanism to cross the boundaries of
   the subject disciplines and thereby promoted change in their attitudes,
   professional knowledge and to some extent, practice.},

Abstract = {How to pedagogically integrate the four STEM (science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics) disciplines is a main discussion issue in
   STEM education. Inquiry-based learning, mathematical modeling, and
   tool-based pedagogy could go hand in hand to provide a possible
   integrated STEM pedagogical framework for mathematics and science. This
   discussion paper explores such a boundary pedagogy via the proposal of
   an inquiry-based modeling pedagogical cycle. The cycle is used as a lens
   to analyze a sequence of tool-based mathematics school lessons conducted
   as a science experiment on the topic of estimation. The lesson design is
   seen through the proposed pedagogical cycles and selected students' work
   is presented to illustrate students' different problem-solving tracks in
   a minimalist instruction environment. Pedagogical features that
   characterize a STEM boundary pedagogical approach are identified. The
   paper concludes with a discussion on some core values of STEM education.},

Abstract = {Research studies have found that mathematics teachers face challenges
   when designing technology-integrated lessons to support mathematical
   inquiry with authentic problems. This suggests that teachers need to
   develop technological pedagogical knowledge (TPACK) or their
   professional knowledge for technology integration. Drawing upon the
   concept of TPACK, this study defines teachers' professional knowledge
   for mathematics technology integration as technological pedagogical
   mathematical knowledge (TPMK) and examines the different kinds of TPMK
   that are needed to support the design of technology-integrated lessons
   for mathematical inquiry with authentic problems. Using content
   analysis, the design talk of three mathematics teachers designing a
   series of technology-integrated lessons to teach the concept of average
   through the inquiry of authentic problems was examined to articulate
   their associated TPMK. Thematic analysis was then used to derive five
   pathways used by the teachers to create the TPMK for mathematical
   inquiry with authentic problems throughout the design meetings that the
   teachers held across 2months. These pathways articulate the process of
   teachers' pedagogical decision-making as they create TPMK. The
   implications of these findings for future development of teacher
   knowledge for technology-supported mathematics inquiry are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to explore low and non-low achievers' motivation
   towards science learning among 8th graders in two public schools in
   central Taiwan under inquiry-based instruction. Mixed design research
   methods were adopted, and students were divided into experimental (n=56)
   and control groups (n=45). Six non-consecutive inquiry units
   (90-180minutes each) were taught to the experimental group during one
   semester, while same topic units were instructed traditionally in the
   control group. A questionnaire measuring students' motivation towards
   science learning {[}MILS] was implemented as pre- and post-tests in both
   the experimental and control groups. Moreover, the teachers and 12
   non-low achievers, and six low achievers from each group were
   interviewed four times in this semester. ANCOVA were used to analyze
   quantitative data in the questionnaire, and the interview data were
   coded. The results showed that statistically non-low achievers'
   achievement goals and perception of their learning environment in the
   experimental group significantly improved more than those in the control
   group. Practically, non-low achievers' expectancy and learning
   strategies and low achievers' confidence, value of science learning,
   achievement goals, learning strategies, and perception of learning
   environment in the experimental group were better than those in the
   control group. Low achievers still needed to use more learning
   strategies. Additionally, in the experimental group, hands-on activities
   and conceptual understanding motivated both achievers, various learning
   strategies motivated non-low achievers, and teachers and peers'
   assistance motivated low achievers. However, both achievers under
   intervention had more exam anxiety than those under traditional teaching
   due to their weak ability to calculate.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of emotions in the professional life of teachers,
   there is not much research on daily emotions of mathematics teachers
   beyond general research on mathematics anxiety of mathematics teachers
   and pre-service teachers in elementary school. Using the theory of
   cognitive structure of emotions, this qualitative case study research
   starts filling this gap by pursuing the following goals: (1) identify
   the daily discrete emotions in classroom of a high school mathematics
   teacher, (2) identify the situations that trigger those emotions, and
   (3) identify the appraisal structure that supports those emotions. Data
   was gathered through audiotaped self-reports in which the participating
   teacher reported his emotional experiences during 13 mathematics classes
   and one interview performed after the receipt of all self-reports. Our
   results show that the teacher participant experienced diverse emotions,
   such as satisfaction, disappointment, appreciation, happy-for,
   sorry-for, reproach, and anger. The triggering situations for the
   cognitive appraisals are about the achievement of the planned activities
   for the lessons and student learning. The support of the appraisals is
   the participants' belief that the good attitude of studentsstudents'
   collaboration, independence, and participationis a necessary condition
   to achieve participant's goals in class and for the students to learn.
   Our results are, in general, consistent with the research on emotions of
   teachers from elementary to high-school levels which shows that
   students' behavior in the classroom has an important impact on teachers'
   emotional experiences. We propose the hypothesis, for future research,
   that the emotional experiences of other mathematics teachers in
   classroom are triggered by the perceived mathematical behavior and the
   perceived mathematical learning of their students.},

Abstract = {Text is the primary tool to learn disciplinary knowledge in school.
   Text-based learning is shaped by a complex interplay between the text
   and reader characteristics. This study examined the role of text
   structure and inhibition in conceptual learning about energy. Inhibition
   implies the ability to block dominant but inappropriate responses
   automatically activated. Eighty-five fourth and fifth graders were
   randomly assigned to the condition of standard expository text, or the
   condition of refutation text in a pre-test, post-test, and delayed
   post-test design. Findings revealed that students progressed from pre-
   to post-test and maintained the gained knowledge at delayed post-test
   regardless of text read. Moreover, only for refutation-text readers
   inhibition, as measured by response times, uniquely predicted conceptual
   learning at delayed post-test over and above reading comprehension,
   prior knowledge, and short-term conceptual learning. The study deepens
   our understanding of the refutation text effect by revealing its
   association with the ability to activate inhibitory control and
   suggesting a previously unexplored benefit of the refutation text for
   learning science concepts.},

Abstract = {This study describes how we developed a learning progression (LP) for
   systems thinking in ecosystems and collected preliminary validity
   evidence for the LP. In particular, the LP focuses on how middle and
   high school students use discipline-specific systems thinking concepts
   (e.g. feedback loops and energy pyramid) to analyze and explain the
   interdependent relationships in ecosystems and humans' impact on those
   relationships. We administrated written assessments with 596 secondary
   students. Based on the data, we developed and validated an LP for
   systems thinking in ecosystems. The LP contains four levels that
   describe increasingly sophisticated reasoning patterns that students
   commonly use to explain phenomena about interdependent relationships in
   ecosystems. We used a Wright Map based on the Rasch model for polyotmous
   data to evaluate the validity of the LP. We also used the LP to compare
   the performance of students from different subgroups in terms of
   socioeconomic status (SES), gender, and school settings. The data
   suggests performance gaps for students with low SES and students from
   urban schools, but not for other traditionally under-served or
   under-represented groups such as female students and students from rural
   schools.},

   Interpretation of Teacher's Intentions},

Abstract = {Given its pedagogical appeal, the number line is a commonly used
   representation in the teaching and learning of fractions. However,
   behind its apparent simplicity, this mathematical object may involve
   layers of complexity when looked at from the perspective of affordances
   as is the case in this study. In particular, this in situ exploration
   examined the affordances of the number line as a mathematical object in
   fractions instruction. Watson's (Res Math Educ 9(1), 111-126, 2007)
   analytical framework was used to scrutinise moment-by-moment teaching
   sequences from videotaped data collected from four 7th grade lessons
   conducted by 2 teachers. The results show the dissonance that may arise
   between teachers' intentions and the accompanying students'
   interpretations when the number line is the object of discussion. The
   teachers inadvertently used the area and measurement model of fractions
   almost simultaneously with the result that students were constrained to
   make sense of the teachers' intention. Consequently, the 2 teachers made
   several instructional attempts to enable the affordances concealed in
   the number line to become more perceptible. Such instructional attempts
   took the form of modified tasks, questions, prompts and actions that the
   teachers brought to the fore spontaneously. Aligning with known
   difficulties associated with number lines, this study further highlights
   the instructional subtleties that may be necessary in making affordances
   visible to help students understand the measure meaning of fractions.
   Explicitness in instruction is critical to enable the affordances
   inherent in a mathematical object to be perceptible to allow access to
   concepts.},

Abstract = {There is growing interest, worldwide, in collaboration between schools
   and community organisations in contributing to and enriching school
   science programs, yet such collaborations are inadequately understood.
   This paper reports data from an Australian study designed to probe the
   views of members of the community who have participated in a broad range
   of such collaborations in school science programmes in order to better
   understand the issues which impact on their operation. The data were
   collected by interviews with the community participants selected by
   opportunistic sampling. The analysis reveals a number of
   issues-purposes, communication, organisational structures and
   curriculum-which can be seen as impacting on the collaborations. These
   are examined through the concepts of communities of practice, boundaries
   and boundary crossing, associated with people from scientific
   communities of practice interacting with school communities. The paper
   reflects on the implications of these findings for constructing
   effective school-community collaboration in school science programs.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we recommend mathematical teaching through dual
   treatments. The dual treatments notion, classified in dual
   interpretations, dual analyses, dual solutions, and dual formulations,
   is explained through concrete examples taken from mathematical textbooks
   of elementary education. Dual treatments provide opportunities for
   creating different points of view on a mathematical situation and thus
   developing the integrative perceptions of the students. Teaching through
   dual treatments for integrative perceptions formation was evaluated
   during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic school year periods. Data
   were evaluated using ANOVA and t test analyses. The study, involving 205
   students in the first grade of the elementary education, demonstrated
   that mathematical teaching through dual treatments (1) influences the
   integrative perceptions formation; (2) there is no significant
   difference between girls and boys after the implementation of teaching
   through dual treatments in integrative perceptions formation.},

   were administered the scientific concept test, scientific
   concept-dependent reasoning test, and scientific inquiry test before, 1
   week after, and 8 weeks after instruction. In addition, students'
   scientific inquiry worksheets in the classroom were collected and
   evaluated. Results indicated that the experimental group outperformed
   the control group, regardless of scientific concept test, scientific
   concept-dependent reasoning test, and scientific inquiry test. Moreover,
   the classroom inquiry worksheets results demonstrated that the
   experimental group generated a significantly greater number of testable

Abstract = {There were two purposes in the study. One was to explore the cognitive
   activities during spatial problem solving and the other to probe the
   relationship between spatial ability and science concept learning.
   Twenty university students participated in the study. The Purdue
   Visualization of Rotations Test (PVRT) was used to assess the spatial
   ability, whose items were divided into different types of problems with
   respect to the rotation angles and levels of plane invisibility. The eye
   tracking technology and the interview technique were employed to analyze
   subjects' the online cognitive processes and problem solving strategies.
   Students' concept gains were examined by content analysis after reading
   a science report. The result shows that, first, the interview analysis
   shows that students of different PVRT performances employed different
   problem solving strategies. Second, rotation angles as well as levels of
   plane invisibility inserted significant effects on the online processes
   and performances of the spatial problem solving. Third, the accuracy
   performance of PVRT was correlated with eye movement patterns. At last,
   it was found that concept performance was not correlated with PVRT
   performance but associated with spatial memory and problem solving
   strategies.},

Abstract = {This study explored the process of physics teaching assistants' (TAs)
   PCK development in the context of teaching a new undergraduate
   introductory physics course. Matter and Interactions (M\&I) has recently
   adopted a new introductory physics course that focuses on the
   application of a small number of fundamental physical principles to the
   atomic and molecular nature of matter. The purpose of this study is to
   describe how the PCK of physics TAs in the M\&I course was developed and
   enacted. Data collection began during the TA preparation workshop that
   was held before the semester and continued during the recitation and
   laboratory classes that the TAs taught during the semester. Through a
   qualitative, multiple case study research design, data were collected
   from multiple sources: non-participant observations, digitally recorded
   video, semi-structured interviews, TAs' written reflections, and
   researchers' field notes. Data analysis consisted of cross-case and
   within-case analyses. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative
   method. After data analysis, 2 main themes emerged related to the
   development of TA's PCK: (a) TAs' PCK developed from propositional
   knowledge to personal practical knowledge and (b) the process of
   knowledge development consisted of 3 phases: accepting, actualizing, and
   internalizing. The results of this study will not only contribute to the
   quest to identify the nature of professional knowledge of science
   teaching but also help guide preparation for innovative introductory
   physics courses and other college level science courses in the future.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how students' participation in a place-based
   science curriculum may influence their place attachment (dependence and
   identity). Participants attend an urban high school in Hawai'i and are
   members of different cultural institutions within the school. Students
   are either enrolled in an environmental science class within the
   Hawaiian Academy or in a general biology, non-academy affiliated science
   class. Interview transcripts, field notes, and student documents suggest
   place-based science had different impacts on student place attachment
   depending on cultural affiliation within the school. Namely, students in
   the Hawaiian Academy show greater depth of understanding of science
   concepts and content, while non-Hawaiian Academy students show interest
   in the affective aspects of the class. Members from both groups show an
   increase in the incorporation of the natural environment as an aspect of
   their place attachments. Results suggest a need for learning
   opportunities that promote cultures, identities, and literacies not
   typically recognized in school for all students.},

Abstract = {Processes of knowledge construction are investigated. A learner is
   constructing knowledge about the notion of limit in the definition of
   the horizontal asymptote. The analysis is based on the dynamically
   nested epistemic action model for abstraction in context. Different
   tasks are offered to the learner. In her effort to perform the different
   tasks, the learner encounters a situation of conflict between her
   concept image of the horizontal asymptote and the concept definition.
   The model of abstraction in context is used to analyze two new
   constructions of knowledge for the learner, which permit her to
   reconsider her concept image and to conceptually understand the
   definition of the horizontal asymptote.},

Title = {PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS' INITIAL CONCEPTIONS ABOUT PUPILS' DIFFICULTIES IN

Abstract = {A crucial issue for prospective teachers (PTs) in their education is to
   develop pedagogical content knowledge (PCK; i.e. how to make a topic
   comprehensible to pupils). However, research has shown that PTs may have
   tacit ideas about teaching that act as filters preventing consideration
   of unfamiliar and discrepant ideas. These ideas must be elicited and
   taken into consideration in order to be modified. Therefore, PTs'
   explicit conceptions may constitute a valuable resource in teacher
   education. The aim of this study was to investigate PTs' ideas about
   pupils' difficulties, at a topic-specific level, upon beginning the
   teacher education programme. The ``Lesson Preparation Method{''} was
   used in four case studies to elicit the conceptions of 32 PTs regarding
   pupils' difficulties in four specific science and mathematics topics:
   plant growth, gases, equations and heat and temperature. In all four
   topic groups (n = 5 - 11), there was a variety of initial conceptions
   about pupils' difficulties, which were categorised into two to five
   topic-specific categories. Although, initially, PTs may not have
   expressed any notions about pupils' difficulties, conceptions were
   elicited by using the Lesson Preparation Method. Furthermore, we found
   that the initial ideas corresponded with earlier research on pupils'
   difficulties, which could provide a potential resource when creating a
   scaffolding context in teacher education programmes where PCK
   development is stimulated.},

Abstract = {International comparative studies and cross-cultural studies of
   mathematics achievement indicate that Chinese students (whether living
   in or outside China) consistently outperform their Western counterparts.
   This study shows that the gap between Chinese-Australian and other
   Australian students is best explained by differences in motivation to
   achieve, attributing success to effort, the influence of parental help
   and the use of extra mathematics curricula. The argument explored is, in
   order to promote students' mathematics achievement, we must improve the
   pedagogical knowledge of classroom teachers of mathematics, as well as
   to encourage parents' involvement in the mathematics education of their
   children and to promote students' motivation to learn mathematics.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effectiveness of using scholarly descriptions of
   inquiry-based teaching as a professional development strategy aimed at
   improving elementary teachers' social understandings (i.e., how teachers
   perceive their own and their students' social roles and relationships in
   the context of inquiry-based science instruction). The reported findings
   reveal that, while participating in expert-guided discussions, teachers
   articulated deeper, theory-based social understandings. Teachers
   recognized the dialogic nature of initiation-response-feedback,
   considered the third move in triadic dialogue as multifunctional,
   identified potential complications of avoiding evaluation, recognized
   nonverbal means of evaluation, and defined teacher feedback and guidance
   discursively. Teachers also identified lack of neutrality as having a
   negative impact on inquiry, considered the implications of verbatim
   repetitions of students' responses, and articulated strategies to deal
   with students' misconceptions and remain neutral. The significance of
   this study is that it shows how expert-guided introduction of scholarly
   descriptions of classroom discourse can serve as effective means to
   bring educational theory and practice together in the context of
   professional development and to increase teachers' awareness of the
   discourse structure of inquiry-based science instruction.},

Abstract = {This study examines a commonly held view that teachers tend to focus
   less on developing understanding and more on mechanistic answer-finding
   when teaching in classes of lower-achieving students. The study
   investigates this by analyzing actual practices of teaching mathematics
   and of classroom interactions in classes having different levels taught
   by the same teacher. Four classes taught by two teachers participated in
   the study. Each teacher taught the same probability syllabus in two of
   the classes; one class of higher-and one of lower-achieving students.
   Quantitative and qualitative analyses of observed teaching practices and
   classroom interactions suggest that one teacher adopted a teaching for
   mechanistic answer-finding approach in both of her classes, whereas the
   other teacher used a teaching-for-understanding approach. In contrast
   with current literature, both teaching approaches were somewhat
   amplified in the lower-level class of each teacher. The manuscript
   suggests that in their own way, each teacher attempted to help more
   those students who encountered more difficulties-the lower-achieving
   students- and they did so by using the resources available to them.
   Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

   REPRESENTATIONS: EXPERTS' VIEWS AND CHALLENGES FOR LEARNING},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Recent curriculum reform promotes core competencies such as desired
   `content knowledge' and `communication' for meaningful learning in
   biology. Understanding in biology is demonstrated when pupils can apply
   acquired knowledge to new tasks. This process requires the transfer of
   knowledge and the subordinate process of translation across external
   representations. This study sought ten experts' views on the role of
   transfer and translation processes in biology learning. Qualitative
   analysis of the responses revealed six expert themes surrounding the
   potential challenges that learners face, and the required cognitive
   abilities for transfer and translation processes. Consultation with
   relevant curriculum documents identified four types of biological
   knowledge that students are required to develop at the secondary level.
   The expert themes and the knowledge types exposed were used to determine
   how pupils might acquire and apply these four types of biological
   knowledge during learning. Based on the findings, we argue that teaching
   for understanding in biology necessitates fostering `horizontal' and
   `vertical' transfer (and translation) processes within learners through
   the integration of knowledge at different levels of biological
   organization.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Research on teacher educators' professional learning has gained
   increasing interest within science education. Curriculum materials have
   been suggested as a means of supporting teacher learning for several
   decades but have not yet been examined as a potential tool for
   supporting the learning of teacher educators. In this paper, we
   conceptualize a set of design heuristics to guide the development of
   educative curriculum materials for teacher educators. We illustrate how
   these heuristics guided the identification of specific educative
   features, which we included when developing prototype educative
   curriculum materials for elementary science teacher educators in content
   and/or method courses to support the development of preservice teachers'
   content knowledge for teaching about matter and its interactions.},

Title = {Is Immersion in 3D Virtual Games Associated with Mathematical Ability
   Improvement in Game-Based Learning?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 4},
Abstract = {Previous studies have found positive effects of Game-Based Learning for
   mathematics. While most studies assume that this effect is explained by
   the presence of flow/immersion during games, this has not yet been
   established. The aim of the current study is to verify if immersion
   indeed is associated with mathematical skills improvement when using a
   Game-Based Learning intervention. This was tested among 59 Greek high
   school students, using authentic design. After having received a
   traditional education module, the students were tested and then engaged
   for four weeks in a desktop-based 3D Virtual Learning Environment where
   they could play mathematic minigames. They were subsequently re-tested
   to verify if they showed a significant increase in mathematical skills.
   The students showed an improvement in their mathematical skills (Cohen's
   d = 1.26), with significant results for functions, geometry, and
   thinking skills and methods. On the individual level, about half of the
   students showed a 10\% increase in one of the domains (numbers \&
   calculations, functions, geometry, thinking skills and methods, and
   algorithms and number theory). Immersion was found to be reflected by
   engagement and presence, but neither one of these aspects was associated
   with mathematical achievement after the intervention. It is concluded
   that Game-Based Learning is an effective approach to increasing
   mathematical skills, yet the underlying mechanisms are not yet
   understood. The authors discuss several alternative mechanisms based on
   the literature that can be verified in future studies.},

Abstract = {This introductory paper to the special issue ``Reading in Science and
   Mathematics{''} presents four major theoretical perspectives of reading,
   literacy, and language that underpin many studies in this area,
   including the nine articles selected for this issue. It first outlines
   several new developments and contemporary issues that drive the growing
   importance of reading in science and mathematics. It then presents the
   perspectives that inform and situate the authors' research as reported
   in this special issue, followed by a brief introduction of their
   articles situated within each of the perspectives. The four perspectives
   are reading comprehension, scientific/mathematical literacy,
   disciplinary literacy, and linguistic/semiotic meaning-making. The
   purpose in discussing these perspectives is to map out the theoretical
   terrain in the field and connect the key ideas within the research on
   reading in science and mathematics.},

Abstract = {The cultural diversity of Malaysia gives a way to three types of public
   primary schools which vary in terms of cultural and medium of
   instruction. This study aimed to explore the difference between the
   performance of grade four primary students from the rural region of
   Malaysia in solving word problems involving measurement formula and
   higher order thinking skills. The sample of the study consisted of a
   total of 107 students from the three types of schools, namely National
   Primary School, Chinese National-Type Primary School and Tamil
   National-Type Primary School located in the rural region of Penang,
   Malaysia. The results indicated that there was no significant difference
   between the performance of the students from the three types of schools.
   However, most of the students performed below the minimum proficiency
   level. The findings of the study suggest that the teaching approach
   should be shifted to be more focused on problem-solving skills and more
   educational intervention for promoting students' problem-solving ability
   of the students should be designed and implemented in the three types of
   schools.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon constructionism and neo-materialist approaches on the role
   of physical activity and the human body in teaching and learning
   mathematics, this paper investigates the meanings constructed by
   students while collaboratively carrying out tasks focusing on the
   dynamic aspects of the concept of angle in the educational context of a
   6(th) grade class of a public primary school in Greece. Paying
   particular attention to the specific material configurations at play, we
   try to analyse the construction processes through which angle was used
   both as a measure represented by a number and as a directed turn in the
   simulated 3D space of a digital tool that combines 3D Turtle Geometry
   and dynamic manipulation. Following a design-based research method,
   mathematical meanings are analysed as contingent assemblages involving
   gestures, embodied metaphors, navigation in virtual spaces, viewpoints,
   figural representations of 2D and 3D geometrical objects and ways of
   verbal and symbolic expression.},

Abstract = {In this study, we analyzed the descriptive knowledge and mental models
   of the phenomenon of tides manifested by 111 preservice primary
   teachers. The instrument employed is an open-ended questionnaire,
   analyzed by means of an approach that explores the descriptions,
   explanations, and predictions in respect of this phenomenon by our
   subjects. First, we made a descriptive study of the kinds of ideas
   applied across different dimensions of analysis, and, subsequently, a
   cluster analysis was performed to check how those ideas were articulated
   and modeled. By means of this analysis, we were able to identify the
   mental models underlying the responses of preservice primary teachers.
   Furthermore, the results showed that the models they did have were not
   used when it came to making predictions in local situations. Instead,
   they employed heuristic rules based on everyday assumptions, not always
   consistent with tidal cycles of approximately 12 h. However, faced with
   situations that required thinking on a global scale, they did use their
   models, normally based on alternative conceptions. Lastly, from the
   results obtained, we consider some of the possible difficulties that
   preservice primary teachers may have in learning about the phenomenon of
   tides, and the implications for future teaching-learning designs aimed
   at overcoming those difficulties.},

Abstract = {This study presents a glimpse into the private classrooms of biology
   instructors and the way they practice formative assessments within a
   college context. Drawing on the personal practice assessment theory
   model from Box, Skoog and Dabbs (2015), we carried out a multiple case
   study to investigate two biology instructors' theories in enacting
   formative assessment practices. Data collected included classroom
   observations, instructor interviews, course artifacts, and student focus
   groups. Qualitative data analysis revealed that each instructor's core
   personal practical assessment theories affected implementation of
   formative assessment. Tasha's core assessment theories led her to
   believe that assessment should be a carefully planned motivational and
   learning opportunity for students. Meanwhile, Jack viewed assessment as
   a diverse and stress-free student learning experiment. Cross-case
   analysis revealed that the teachers' reasoning and decision-making
   differences were based on the interaction of their personal practical
   assessment theories and contextual elements. Overall, this study
   provides insights into the practice of formative assessment in higher
   education and identifies some challenges and opportunities such
   assessment presents.},

Abstract = {Despite compelling arguments for the importance of revisiting school
   mathematics in pre-service mathematics teacher education, there is
   little indication of how such revisiting might be done, particularly at
   secondary level. We argue that revisiting provides three key
   opportunities for learning: (1) additional time on the mathematics that
   pre-service teachers will teach in schools; (2) attention to
   mathematical practices and (3) opportunity to learn about seminal
   constructs and findings from the mathematics education research
   literature. We illustrate these with three revisiting tasks and their
   enactment in a course where opportunities for revisiting were
   deliberately offered. We also discuss challenges that arise as teacher
   educators intentionally design opportunities for revisiting school
   mathematics.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to reveal the extent to which citizenship values are
   included in Saudi Arabian elementary science textbooks, which teachers
   have to use. The content of six grades 4 to 6 textbooks used in the
   first and second semesters was analyzed with a focus on three themes
   related to citizenship values: cultural, social, and political
   dimensions. Each of these value dimensions has 10 sub-components. Each
   textbook for each semester was analyzed using a purposively developed
   Likert scale to gauge the extent of citizenship value inclusion. The
   results reflect nominal inclusion of citizenship values in the science
   textbooks: cultural values reflected low inclusion (mean 2.09),
   political values had low inclusion (mean 1.97), and social values had
   very low inclusion (1.77). In addition, there was an insufficient degree
   of balanced progression and expansion of the distribution of citizenship
   values in relation to their different dimensions over the successive
   school grade levels. Saudi curriculum planners are encouraged to design
   developmentally appropriate science curricula that include citizenship
   values in each of content, resources (especially textbooks), activities,
   topics/issues, and assessment.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article was to determine the factors in teachers'
   actions that could explain differences in the emotional atmosphere of
   primary school classrooms. Based on pupils' drawings about their
   mathematics lessons, we analyzed both the pupils' and their teachers'
   actions, including pupils requesting help, sitting alone, and talking
   about mathematics, as well as the teacher helping, praising and
   criticizing. We could conclude that the teacher has a central role in
   the formation of the emotional atmosphere in mathematics lessons. The
   emotional atmosphere can be built up to be positive when the teacher
   encourages the pupils to talk about mathematics and their own
   understanding with each other. The emotional atmosphere is then open and
   tolerant. The emotional atmosphere can turn to be negative when the
   pupils are working by themselves and are afraid of criticism and
   embarrassment.},

Abstract = {Research that focuses on teacher identity is gaining traction as
   researchers argue that teachers mediate more than mathematical knowledge
   and skills in the classroom. This research tends to be underpinned by a
   social constructionist orientation, which foregrounds epistemology over
   ontology. This orientation is limiting for research that wishes to
   understand the base conditions that enable or constrain the expression
   (i.e. both communication and action) of teacher identity in teaching
   primary mathematics. The paper suggests that this requires research that
   explores the interaction between structure, culture and agency in the
   expression of teacher identity in teaching mathematics in primary
   school. The study argues that a social realist orientation is of value
   to research on teacher identity. From this perspective, teacher identity
   is defined as the manner in which teachers express their roles as
   teachers. As the paper is primarily theoretical, the exemplification is
   limited to two primary school teachers' expression of only one role
   namely effective communicator of mathematics. It demonstrates what
   social realism enables, that is, not illuminated in research underpinned
   by a social constructionist orientation. The argument made in this paper
   elucidates how social realism supports a deep analysis of the structural
   and agential conditions that enable and constrain teacher identities.},

Abstract = {Cognitive model {[}CM] is the description of individual's
   problem-solving method on selected tasks at a precise level to make
   meaningful inference on his/her strengths and weaknesses. CM serves as a
   foundation in developing a cognitive diagnostic assessment {[}CDA] that
   links the interpretation of test score to the attributes. This study
   employed the CDA involving Time which was developed under the framework
   of assessment triangle and Attribute Hierarchy Method {[}AHM]. In this
   study, the expert-based cognitive model was generated by 7 experienced
   primary mathematics teachers while the student-based cognitive model was
   generated based on 259 Year 6 pupils' responses in the CDA. The
   consistency between these cognitive models was calculated by using
   Hierarchical Consistency Index {[}HCI] and triangulated by pupils'
   interview transcript. Hence, this paper aims to discuss the consistency
   of structure between the expert-based cognitive models and the
   student-based cognitive models. The extent of match between the
   expert-based and the student-based cognitive models is important as it
   determines the validity of the expert-based cognitive model from
   students' perspective. In general, all the 3 expert-based cognitive
   models were excellently fit with the student-based cognitive models.
   However, the result shows that the cognitive models of those pupils who
   scored 50\% and below exhibited poor fit to the expert-based cognitive
   models. Results of the study implied that the proposed CMs are able to
   predict pupils' responses and there is a need to construct CM which is
   suitable for low ability pupils in order to help them in studying the
   topic of Time.},

Abstract = {This study critically examines if digital divides, comprising access to
   and use of information technology (IT) in two spheres (schools and at
   home), affect student achievement in Confucian heritage cultures (CHCs).
   The sample comprised 38,158 students from 1030 schools in seven CHCs who
   participated in Program for International Student Assessment (PISA)
   2012. Markov chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation, hierarchical linear
   modeling (HLM), and latent class analysis (LCA) were employed in the
   analysis. Results showed that home (but not school) IT use benefited
   student mathematics achievement, and students with the overall least IT
   resources were most academically successful. These results indicate the
   importance of understanding the nuanced effects of digital divides in
   different contexts.},

Abstract = {Writing is recognized as a critical skill in science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematical fields, as it provides opportunities for
   individuals to think critically about learned information, integrate
   knowledge, communicate understanding, and contribute new information to
   the field. Requirements for applying mathematical knowledge to writing
   require a seamless blend of content-specific knowledge, domain-specific
   vocabulary, and an understanding of written expression. Relatively,
   little is known about how mathematics writing is currently being
   assessed in K-12 classrooms to promote the acquisition and growth of
   students' writing. This exploratory survey research sought to evaluate
   how undergraduate students across various career majors, at a large
   university in the USA, perceive the writing quality of elementary
   mathematics writing samples. Research determined that respondents valued
   accuracy of the mathematics, logical explanation, effort of the
   response, as well as organization/mechanics of the writing. The extremes
   of mathematical writing had the most reliable scores, bringing attention
   to the need to develop quality assessments (e.g., rubrics) that address
   subjectivity of writing quality indicators and explicitly communicate
   expectations of mathematics writing. Implications for practice and
   future research are presented.},

Abstract = {In this study, effects of 2 physical manipulative instructions on
   students' geometrical knowledge acquisition were compared. Geometry
   topics' presentation was conducted via using physical manipulative and
   the practice stage in two different forms: (1) practice consisting of
   problems supported with explicit metacognitive questions and (2)
   practice consisting of problems not supported with explicit
   metacognitive questions. Participants were 220 6th grade students,
   studying in 5 classrooms. Students' knowledge acquisitions were tested
   by administering knowledge tests before and after the instruction.
   Furthermore, follow-up interviews were conducted with randomly selected
   students according to their achievement levels to get their views about
   the effect of manipulative instruction on their geometrical knowledge
   acquisition. The results indicated that the two instructions were
   equally effective in promoting geometrical knowledge acquisition.
   Metacognitive questions together with manipulative use and group work
   seemed to help partly students' knowledge acquisition. Hence, active
   involvement, both physically and cognitively, seemed to play a crucial
   role.},

Abstract = {Academic language is critical for English learners (ELs) to succeed in
   the science classroom. This study analyzed the instructional practices
   centered around academic language taking place in eight, fifth-grade
   classrooms during a grant-funded project. Observational data collected
   through a classroom observation instrument were analyzed to describe and
   compare the instructional practices occurring in treatment and control
   classrooms when teachers and students used academic language. Our
   findings show both treatment and control classrooms using academic
   language during the course of the intervention study, but the
   instruction looked markedly different in each setting. These differences
   provide valuable insight for practitioners and researchers concerned
   with the academic language development of ELs in science classrooms.},

Abstract = {The present study uses the intuitive rules theory as a framework to
   examine whether some of the difficulties in dealing with errors and
   uncertainties observed among students in the university physics
   laboratory can stem from their use of intuitive rules. The study also
   examines the relationship between the use of intuitive rules and
   laboratory experience level. Based on interviews with 20 students and a
   research sample, which included 52 students, having different laboratory
   experiences, our findings show that students used the intuitive rules in
   the tasks they were provided. Moreover, students with less laboratory
   experience used the intuitive rules more frequently than students with
   more laboratory experience. Understanding the influence of intuitive
   rules on students' performance, when dealing with experimental data, may
   be a great help to educators in designing better learning environments
   to address related science and engineering practices.},

Abstract = {The mathematical preparedness of science undergraduates has been a
   subject of debate for some time. This paper investigates the
   relationship between school mathematics attainment and degree outcomes
   in biology and chemistry across England, a much larger scale of analysis
   than has hitherto been reported in the literature. A unique dataset
   which links the National Pupil Database for England (NPD) and Higher
   Education Statistics Agency (HESA) data is used to track the educational
   trajectories of a national cohort of 16-year olds through their school
   and degree programmes. Multilevel regression models indicate that
   students who completed advanced mathematics qualifications prior to
   their university study of biology and chemistry were no more likely to
   attain the best degree outcomes than those without advanced mathematics.
   The models do, however, suggest that success in advanced chemistry at
   school predicts outcomes in undergraduate biology and vice versa. There
   are important social background differences and the impact of the
   university attended is considerable. We discuss a range of possible
   explanations of these findings.},

Abstract = {This study explored whether pre-service teachers' (PSTs') lesson
   analysis skills during a teacher education course in the country of
   Turkey were related to their skills of lesson planning. PSTs' lesson
   analysis skills during fieldwork were assessed by their attention to and
   interpretation of student thinking and learning, and how it is
   influenced by the teachers' instructional decisions. The PSTs' lesson
   analysis scores were significantly and positively correlated with scores
   in lesson planning task focusing on student thinking. The findings
   contribute to the literature on whether PSTs' lesson analysis skills may
   be transferred to one of the core activities of teaching.},

Abstract = {This study reports entry-level mathematics attitudes of pre-service
   primary teachers entering an initial teacher education (ITE) program one
   decade apart. Attitudes of 360 pre-service primary teachers were
   compared to 419 pre-service teachers entering the same college of
   education almost one decade later. The latter experienced reform school
   mathematics curricula compared to the earlier cohort who experienced
   traditional curricula. Attitudes were determined by administering
   Aiken's Revised Mathematics Attitude Scale (Aiken, 1974). Analyses
   indicate generally positive attitudes on entry to ITE. The earlier
   cohort demonstrated greater Enjoyment of Mathematics while the later
   cohort exhibited higher scores on the Value of Mathematics scale.},

Abstract = {The purposes of this study are to investigate Turkish pre-service middle
   school mathematics teachers' ability in conducting valid proofs for
   statements regarding numbers and algebra in terms of their year of
   enrollment in a teacher education program, to determine the proof
   methods used in their valid proofs, and to examine the reasons for their
   invalid arguments. A proof questionnaire containing three proof
   statements was administered to 115 pre-service middle school mathematics
   teachers in a large state university in Ankara, Turkey. The results
   showed that more than half of the pre-service teachers were able to
   conduct valid proofs for the given statements. In terms of year levels,
   it was seen that the seniors were the least successful group in
   conducting valid proofs for each statement. When pre-service teachers'
   valid proofs were analyzed, it was concluded that mathematical induction
   and direct proof were the mostly used methods for the given statements.
   When pre-service teachers' invalid arguments were analyzed, it was seen
   that ``inserting numbers to verify the given statement{''} and
   ``rewriting the givens in the statement{''} were the common reasons for
   stating invalid arguments.},

Abstract = {Dealing with multiple representations and their connections plays a key
   role for learners to build up conceptual knowledge in the mathematics
   classroom. Hence, professional knowledge and views of mathematics
   teachers regarding the use of multiple representations certainly merit
   attention. In particular, investigating such views of preservice
   teachers affords identifying corresponding needs for teacher education,
   However, specific empirical research is scarce. Taking into account the
   possible role of culture, this study consequently focuses on views about
   using multiple representations held by more than 100 English and more
   than 200 German preservice teachers. The results indicate that there are
   culture-dependent aspects of preservice teachers' views, but also that
   there are common needs for professional development.},

Abstract = {Students' attitudes and conceptions seem to be influenced by
   social/cultural contexts and interactions with other students from
   diverse backgrounds. Therefore, educators need to study attitudes,
   conceptions, and career choices in relation to diversity indicators.
   Such was one focus of the Science Education for Diversity project, which
   involved collaboration among UK, The Netherlands, Turkey, Lebanon,
   India, and Malaysia. The purpose of this component of the project was to
   investigate Lebanese students' attitudes, conceptions, and career
   choices in relation to gender and religion. The 1,260 Grade 4 to 8
   participants, who came from co-educational private and public schools,
   purposefully selected to include different religions, filled out a
   questionnaire designed specifically for the Project. Results from the
   Lebanon data showed that students generally had positive attitudes
   towards science. They seemed to identify only things they study about in
   school as ``science{''} with some gender differences but no differences
   based on religion. Students seemed to be worried about environmental
   socioscientific issues. About 40 \% of students believed that God
   created all life and that their families believed that too, with
   significant differences by gender and religion. Finally, the greater
   majority stated that they would like a job that ensures recognition and
   respect. Implications related to maintaining students' interest in
   science and science-related careers were discussed.},

Abstract = {This article reports the results of a study that investigated
   pre-service mathematics teachers' modelling processes in terms of
   representational fluency in a modelling activity related to a cassette
   player. A qualitative approach was used in the data collection process.
   Students' individual and group written responses to the mathematical
   modelling activity, video-taped and transcribed group discussions, and
   classroom observations, were the main sources of data. This study was
   conducted during the spring semester in 2010. Fifty-five pre-service
   teachers were the participants in the study. Systematic coding and
   descriptive statistics were used in analysing the data. The data showed
   that a difficulty with modelling was closely related to the difficulty
   in the transformation of semiotic representations. During the modelling
   process, the two types of transformations, which were the treatments
   within a register and conversions between registers, occurred
   concurrently. In addition, the challenging and motivating nature of the
   modelling process in terms of directing participants to form consistent
   transformations between and within different representation registers
   was observed.},

Abstract = {The generation of reliable and certain evidence is among the central
   objectives of the natural sciences. However, in real-world scientific
   research, dealing with uncertainty is often a necessary part of the
   establishment of certain knowledge. Therefore, science teaching has to
   take into consideration the fact that evidence is not only reliable:
   Whenever science is still in the making, evidence may be temporarily
   uncertain, varying, and fragile. This study reconstructs aspects of
   science teachers' professional competence as well as their orientational
   frameworks when dealing with uncertain evidence in science teaching.
   Semi-structured interviews with video vignettes used as interview
   stimuli were conducted with 26 science teachers. The video vignettes
   were carefully designed and validated in order to illustrate situations
   in which uncertain evidence unexpectedly arises during science teaching.
   The generated data were analyzed based on the documentary method and
   qualitative data analysis. Results indicate that teachers employ a
   variety of strategies for dealing with uncertain evidence. Furthermore,
   our results point to connections between teachers' instructional
   strategies and their beliefs about their own and their students' roles.},

Abstract = {Engaging mathematics students with modelling activities helps them learn
   mathematics meaningfully. This engagement, in the case of model
   eliciting activities, helps the students elicit mathematical models by
   interpreting real-world situation in mathematical ways. This is
   especially true when the students utilize technology to build the
   models. Researchers have been interested in the phases of modelling
   processes that students go through when engaging with modelling
   activities, where looking at these phases from a cognitive aspect gives
   us insight regarding students' processes of mathematizing real
   situation. This was the goal of this research, specifically when middle
   school pre-service teachers use technology in model eliciting
   activities. Six groups of pre-service teachers participated in the
   research engaging in modelling the ``summer reading activity.{''} Three
   different cycles of modelling processes were identified, differing in
   the phase of technology use and in its role in building the models. This
   variability in pre-service teachers' utilization of technology, in our
   case the spreadsheets, imply that the technology which is appropriate
   for a specific modelling activity could be a flexible tool used by the
   learners to mathematize the real-life situation expressed in the
   activity.},

Abstract = {In this study, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study
   2007 data were used to build mathematics achievement models of fourth
   graders in two East Asian school systems: Hong Kong and Singapore. In
   each school system, eight variables at student level and nine variables
   at school/class level were incorporated to build an achievement model
   through hierarchical linear modelling. The final achievement models
   suggested that in both school systems, four variables at student level,
   i.e. number of books at home, frequency of test language spoken at home,
   frequency of mathematics homework, student's self-confidence in learning
   mathematics, and one variables at school/class level, i.e. class size
   for mathematics instruction were significantly correlated with fourth
   graders' mathematics achievement, and student's self-confidence in
   learning mathematics was the strongest predictor of mathematics
   achievement. The relations between mathematics achievement and other
   variables differed across the two systems. Implications for educational
   research and practice are presented at the end of this paper.},

Abstract = {Modern neuroscientific research has substantially enhanced our
   understanding of the human brain. However, many challenges remain in
   developing a strong, brain-based theory of human learning, especially in
   complex environments such as educational settings. Some of the current
   issues and challenges in our progress toward developing comprehensive
   neuroscientific-based theories of human learning, particularly in the
   academic disciplines, are reviewed, beginning with a brief summary of
   the history of publications in science learning. This is followed by an
   analysis of some of the large-scale issues and conceptual problems that
   we currently face in developing a strong, middle-ground
   ``neuroeducational theory{''} relevant to learning, especially in rather
   abstract disciplines such as mathematics and science. Finally, some
   perspectives on possible future strategies and challenges in reaching
   the goal of a neuroeducational theory are presented.},

Abstract = {This study, employing hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), sought to
   investigate the student-level and school-level factors associated with
   the science achievement of immigrant and non-immigrant students among a
   national sample of 22,646 students from 896 schools in Canada. While
   student background characteristics such as home language, family wealth,
   and socioeconomic status were significant predictors of science
   achievement for non-immigrant students, these factors were not
   significantly associated with immigrant student science achievement.
   Student attitudes, engagement, and motivation in science and information
   and communication technology familiarity were significant predictors of
   science achievement for both immigrant and non-immigrant students.
   Whereas teacher shortage was associated with science achievement for
   immigrant students, school size was associated with science achievement
   for non-immigrant students. Implications of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study is aimed at describing profiles of interpersonal behavior of
   Indonesian mathematics teachers and examining associations between
   students' perceptions of their mathematics teachers' interpersonal
   behavior and their motivation in learning mathematics. Data were
   collected with the Indonesian version of the Questionnaire on Teacher
   Interaction (QTI) and the Questionnaire on Motivational Dimensions. The
   framework of this study is based on the Model of Interpersonal Behavior
   that maps teachers' conduct in terms of 2 dimensions: Influence
   (Dominance-Submission) and Proximity (Cooperation-Opposition). A total
   of 506 students (grades 7 to 9) from 16 classes in 5 public secondary
   schools in the West Java and Jambi provinces, Indonesia, participated in
   the study. Data analyses were conducted including descriptive,
   correlational, and multilevel analyses. Results from the data analyses
   showed that the reliability and (validity) of the Indonesian QTI were
   good; teachers' ratings of their interpersonal behavior were moderate in
   class perceptions but (were) quite high in teachers' self-perception in
   both the Proximity and Influence dimensions and that associations
   existed between the 2 dimensions of interpersonal behavior and student
   motivation in learning mathematics. There was an indication that
   Indonesian mathematics teachers were generally perceived as directive.
   Implications of the findings were discussed.},

Abstract = {Understanding energy with a focus on sustainable development requires
   further knowledge beyond traditional conceptual understanding. This
   paper presents the result from one main investigation and two smaller
   follow-up studies. The main study (step 1) consists of an interpreting,
   iterative analysis of statements made by experts on contents for physics
   education on energy with focus on sustainable energy systems gathered
   from a questionnaire, which results in subject-specific contents for
   physics teaching presented as a category system of objectives. The
   categories from step 1 are used as means for analyses in steps 2 and 3,
   which involve the study of educational material and one physics class.
   The results show that the content of physics for upper secondary, in
   order for students to reach insight, should comprise certain physical
   concepts and relations not only in `limited contexts' but also in
   relation to greater contextual connections, in which problematisation
   and insight in solutions for the future is necessary. These parts should
   have a similar weight according to the statements of the experts. This
   is not to be found in either the typical educational material
   (textbooks) or in one physics class, which has been studied.},

Abstract = {This study presents the results of an analysis of high school chemistry
   textbooks and teacher-generated questions about gas laws. The materials
   that were analyzed consisted of 456 questions about gas laws found in
   seven grade 10 chemistry textbooks and 264 teacher-generated examination
   questions prepared by seven chemistry teachers from three schools. These
   questions were classified into three categories (recall, algorithmic,
   and conceptual); the conceptual questions (ConQ) were further classified
   into six subcategories (particulate, demonstration, tiered, laboratory,
   analogy, and series completion) using the descriptions provided on the
   Conceptual Questions and Challenge Problems website. The findings
   indicate that most of the textbook questions were algorithmic and that
   these textbooks were less likely to facilitate or encourage student
   comprehension of the properties and behaviors of gases or gas law
   theories. Furthermore, most of the textbook questions do not enable
   students to develop conceptual understanding and gain higher-order
   cognitive skills. Although the findings imply that most of the
   teacher-generated questions were ConQ, the large majority were partially
   conceptual type questions. The major implication of this research is the
   need for teachers, textbook writers, and academics to consider question
   types when creating questions or analyzing chemistry questions at all
   educational levels.},

Title = {STUDENTS' EVALUATION OF THE CREDIBILITY OF SCIENTIFIC MODELS THAT

Abstract = {The purpose of the current study was to explore learners' evaluation of
   the credibility of scientific models that represent natural entities and
   phenomena. Participants were 845 students in grades 9-11 (aged 15-17
   years) and 108 prospective science teachers in Oman, totaling 953
   students. A survey called Epistemologies about the Credibility of
   Scientific Models was designed to explore participants' epistemological
   positions regarding the credibility of scientific models. This
   instrument was based on a credibility taxonomy proposed by the author.
   This taxonomy was composed of four epistemological levels: certainty,
   imaginary, suspicious, and denial; thus, it was called the CISD
   taxonomy. Findings revealed that natural entities and phenomena were
   assigned to CISD levels according to their level of abstractness. This
   level of abstractness is usually constructed by the most frequently used
   models to represent each natural entity or phenomenon. For instance,
   entities, which were usually represented by photographs or micrographs,
   such as meteors and meteorites, blood cells and bacteria, fell at the
   certainty level. On the other hand, theoretical entities such as
   electron cloud and photons had a high suspicious-denial combinational
   level. Some entities, with possible competing concrete-abstract parallel
   nature of the scientific models that represent them, had both high
   certainty and suspicious-denial levels. The overall students'
   epistemological perceptions across grade levels showed a decrease in the
   certainty level and an increase in the imaginary level. It might also be
   plausible to conclude that new, detailed microscopic and more abstract
   knowledge raised the suspicious and denial levels of some entities.
   Further research based on qualitative research methodologies is needed
   to explore these findings.},

Title = {EVALUATING SELECTED PERCEPTIONS OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS TEACHERS IN
   AN ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {551-569},

Abstract = {In 2003 the University of Missouri (with the aid of US National Science
   Foundation funding) initiated an alternative certification program (ACP)
   to address the well-documented need in the US for increasing the
   quantity and quality of mathematics and science teachers for the middle
   and secondary levels. Nationwide current certification programs do not
   provide the quality and quantity of mathematics and science teachers
   needed in schools. As a result most American states have begun to
   experiment with ACPs as a way to address the shortage of math and
   science teachers. To evaluate the success of this program, we collected
   data from ACP participants regarding perceived preparation, self
   efficacy, and outcome expectancy at three time points in the program.
   State standards for beginning teachers were used to construct a
   perceived preparation instrument. Analysis of data suggests that over
   time, ACP participants exhibited an increasingly positive view toward
   their preparation for classroom teaching, as well as increased self
   efficacy. However, there was little change in the students' outcome
   expectancy over time. In this article we share details of the unique ACP
   program and we describe steps taken to collect and evaluate a project
   data set. Our work provides useful guidance to researchers and
   practitioners in the field of science and mathematics teacher education.},

Abstract = {According to reform documents, teachers are expected to teach proofs and
   proving in school mathematics. Research results indicate that high
   school students prefer verbal proofs to other formats. We found it
   interesting and important to examine the position of secondary school
   teachers with regard to verbal proofs. Fifty high school teachers were
   asked to prove various elementary number theory statements, to write
   correct and incorrect proofs that students may use, and to evaluate
   given justifications to statements from elementary number theory. While
   all the participants provided correct proofs to the statements, our
   findings indicate that teachers are not aware of students' preference
   for verbal justifications. Also, about half of the teachers rejected
   correct verbal justifications. They claimed that these justifications
   lacked generality and are mere examples.},

Abstract = {According to the intuitive rules theory, students are affected by a
   small number of intuitive rules when solving a wide variety of science
   and mathematics tasks. The current study considers the relationship
   between students' Piagetian cognitive levels and their tendency to
   answer in line with intuitive rules when solving comparison tasks. The
   findings indicate that the tendency to answer according to the intuitive
   rules varies with cognitive level. Surprisingly, a higher rate of
   incorrect responses according to the rule same A-same B was found for
   the higher cognitive level. Further findings and implications for
   science and mathematics education are discussed.},

Abstract = {Data from 154 interviews with students in grades 3 to 13 were analyzed
   to suggest a developmental progression of conceptual understanding
   associated with the sample space for two ordinary six-sided dice tossed

   to an extension task involving three six-sided dice with four sides
   painted black and two white. Forty-five of the interviews were
   longitudinal interviews of students 3 or 4 years after the original
   interviews, allowing for analysis of change in levels of understanding
   across time. This study suggests some of the intuitions and
   understandings that form the intermediate steps to a complete
   understanding of outcomes for two dice, as well as documenting the
   conceptual regression likely to occur when a more difficult task is
   encountered. Links to previous research, including well-known

Title = {Development and Validation of a Reading in Science Holistic Assessment
   (RISHA): a Rasch Measurement Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 8},
Abstract = {Researchers in science education lacks valid and reliable instruments to
   assess students' disciplinary and epistemic reading of scientific texts.
   The main purpose of this study was to develop and validate a Reading in
   Science Holistic Assessment (RISHA) to assess students' holistic reading
   of scientific texts. RISHA measures students' content, procedural, and
   epistemic domains of reading two texts, one history-of-science text and
   another socio-scientific text. The initial 24-item RISHA was
   administered to 161 Grade 9 students from 3 schools. The
   multidimensional Rasch partial credit model was used to analyze the
   reliability and validity of RISHA. All items demonstrated good fit and
   reliability. According to logit scores generated for each domain in
   Rasch analysis, students in our study performed better in content domain
   and less well in the epistemic domain. Students also performed
   significantly better in the epistemic domain of the socio-scientific
   text than in the history-of-science text. RISHA provides accurate
   measures in various domains of reading scientific texts and various
   contexts of scientific texts. We propose that RISHA could potentially be
   applied to studying the effect of reading-science intervention or
   predictors of students' performance in each domain of reading scientific
   texts.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {As computational methods are widely used in science disciplines,
   integrating computational thinking (CT) into classroom materials can
   create authentic science learning experiences for students. In this
   study, we classroom-tested a CT-integrated geoscience curriculum module
   designed for secondary students. The module consisted of three inquiry
   investigations that were age-appropriately translated from the
   computational practices of volcanologists who study tephra hazards and
   risks. We developed a domain-specific, block-code-based computational
   modeling environment where students carried out 1 of the 3 science
   practices in each inquiry investigation: experimentation, data
   visualization and interpretation, and modeling. We examined (1) student
   learning outcomes using pre- and post-tests and (2) student reflections
   on the computationally supported science practices surveyed at the end
   of each inquiry investigation during the module. Results indicate that
   students made statistically significant gains in science content as well
   as in computationally supported experimentation, data visualization and
   interpretation, and modeling practices. Over 80\% of students identified
   different ways in which block coding supported their practices during
   inquiry investigations. Based on these findings, we discuss implications
   for the future development of computationally supported inquiry
   investigations in science.},

Abstract = {Including systems thinking in science education helps students
   understand the complex global problems of the present era. The study
   aimed to trace and evaluate the system thinking (ST) skills in K-8
   science curricula, with a focus on sustainability-related subjects and
   units. Firstly, the authors reviewed the related literature on the
   systems thinking models and identified the components of systems
   thinking skills needed to evaluate the science curricula. Secondly, they
   developed a systems thinking rubric with two parts. The first part
   included eleven systems thinking components, definitions, key concepts,
   and sample learning objectives. The second part contained four
   assessment criteria to evaluate the ST levels (novice, beginning,
   intermediate and advanced) in the science curricula and science
   textbooks. Finally, the authors pilot-tested the rubrics to analyze the
   Turkish K-8 science curricula and textbooks in terms of ST skills. The
   results revealed that science curricula and textbooks included nine out
   of eleven systems thinking components; however, they were mostly at the
   beginning level. This study suggests that the integrated rubric is a
   valid and reliable tool to evaluate the systems thinking components, and
   science educators can use it to decide how to integrate ST skills into
   science curricula.},

Abstract = {Physics teachers need diagnostic competence to effectively identify
   students' misconceptions, but studies have yet to sufficiently
   investigate how this competence can be advanced through various
   instructional strategies. In this study, we compared a problem-solving
   strategy against an example-based strategy in advancing diagnostic
   competence in science teacher education. For both instructional
   strategies, we used tasks from Diagnoser.com and controlled for
   preservice teachers' prior diagnostic knowledge. A total of 81
   preservice teachers teaching physics took part in the controlled field
   experiment. A between-subjects experimental design was used to assess
   preservice teachers' diagnostic competence. We used a standardized test
   to measure their diagnostic competence before and after the
   intervention. To measure diagnostic competence, we focused on conceptual
   diagnostic knowledge and knowledge about strategic routines (procedural
   knowledge). The results showed that the problem-solving strategy
   enhanced preservice teachers' conceptual diagnostic knowledge
   significantly more than the example-based strategy did, t(77) = 2.96, p=
   .011, d= 0.812. We also found that problem-solving was better than
   example-based learning in enhancing diagnostic competence in the form of
   conceptual knowledge in comparison with a control group, t(77)=4.97, p <
   .001, d = 1.382. We conclude that, even though both instructional
   strategies can be used to advance preservice teachers' diagnostic
   competence with respect to knowledge about concepts, problem-solving is
   better for enhancing diagnostic competence in identifying students'
   misconceptions than example-based learning is. It is possible that a
   problem-solving instructional strategy has a stronger positive effect on
   the acquisition of knowledge about concepts than on knowledge about
   procedures because this strategy provides scaffolding during the
   learning process.},

Abstract = {This paper examines prospective mathematics teachers' knowledge of
   asymptotes and asymptotic behaviour of functions in calculus. They are
   university students and future facilitators of knowledge in upper
   secondary education. We constructed a reference epistemological model to
   describe the knowledge about asymptotes for upper secondary and
   university education and explored prospective teachers' relations to
   targeted knowledge. The study was conducted within the Anthropological
   Theory of the Didactic as a suitable framework to analyse and interpret
   knowledge of mathematical notions. Prospective teachers participated in
   three questionnaires with open, non-routine questions on different
   aspects of the notion of asymptotes. An analysis showed their knowledge
   was fragmented and their work relied heavily on algebraic manipulation
   and memorized formulas from calculus. The results indicated that
   knowledge of asymptotes and asymptotic behaviour is a potentially
   powerful context for developing knowledge related to the limits of
   functions in calculus.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, secondary school students have indicated a low
   interest in science and a lack of awareness of authentic science careers
   that may impede their aspiration to work in science-related fields in
   future. To raise students' aspirations, several studies used
   context-based approaches, but few integrated career aspects into the
   school curricula. Accordingly, this study aimed to promote lower
   secondary school students' interest in and awareness of science careers
   by introducing science career-related scenarios reflected in a
   real-world context as embedded careers education in science lessons. In
   this study, we explored the effect of the interventions on students'
   interest, awareness, and aspirations towards science careers using
   Estonian, Finnish, and German datasets. According to the results, the
   students participating in the project indicated a higher interest in
   science, aspiration towards science careers, and awareness of future
   careers than those who did not experience the embedded science career
   interventions. Also, the results showed that when students got more
   information about science careers at school, their interest in science
   was more easily transferred to their aspirations in science studies and
   careers. Thus, this result emphasizes the importance of fostering
   awareness of science careers at lower secondary schools in order to
   inspire young learners to engage in science studies and works in future.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated if the argument-driven inquiry (ADI)
   model with embedded explicit-reflective teaching of NOSI improved
   pre-service science teachers' (PSTs) comprehension of the nature of
   scientific inquiry (NOSI). The study employed the qualitative experiment
   method with 16 PSTs. The PSTs working in small groups conducted seven
   ADI laboratory activities. During the activities, NOSI aspects were made
   explicit, and reflective discussions were conducted to provide the PSTs
   with opportunities to discuss and deepen their understanding of NOSI. A
   Views About Scientific Inquiry questionnaire and follow-up interview
   were applied to understand participants' understandings about NOSI
   before and after the instruction. The PSTs displayed a promising
   understanding about NOSI before the instruction. Some of the PSTs
   already had informed views on some NOSI aspects before the instruction,
   and ``inquiry process is instructed by the question{''} was the most
   well-known aspect of NOSI. After the instruction, the PSTs developed
   their views on almost every aspect of NOSI. The most well-understood
   aspects of NOSI were that ``scientific research all starts with a
   question{''} and ``no single scientific method.{''} The results provided
   evidence that the PSTs performed significantly better after the ADI
   laboratory instruction with embedded explicit-reflective teaching of
   NOSI.},

Abstract = {This introductory paper first reflects the genesis of research in
   mathematics and science teacher education. The analyses show a movement
   from foci of research in mathematics and science education from students
   to teachers, and then to teacher educators. Next, an overview of
   research in mathematics and science teacher education and its
   development is provided, including teacher educators' growth. This is
   followed by a comparative look at the seven papers in this special issue
   through three lenses, focusing on who the teacher educators in these
   papers are, the practices which are the focus for development, and the
   contexts in which the professional growth is situated. The seven papers
   not only exemplify how teacher educators might critically and
   systematically reflect on their own growth, educate new teacher
   educators, and do corresponding research, but also demonstrate the
   considerable progress the research community has made with respect to
   the professional growth of mathematics and science teacher educators in
   the last decade. Finally, challenges and questions are raised, in
   particular in relation to raising the quality and quantity of proficient
   teacher educators in order to strengthen teacher education research, and
   to have enough human resources to offer more and better professional
   development opportunities and to support schools.},

Abstract = {The conflict between acceptance and disapproval of evolution has led to
   obstacles in its teaching and learning. Other difficulties, such as both
   teachers' and students' alternative perceptions, student maturity in the
   face of learning this complicated topic, and teachers' gaps in evolution
   knowledge, add to the difficulties in teaching and learning evolution.
   The aim of this study was to grasp the difficulties in the teaching and
   learning of evolution perceived by curriculum writers compared to those
   perceived by in-service junior high school science and technology
   teachers and high school biology teachers in Israel. The findings
   revealed a wide range of perceived difficulties in the teaching and
   learning of evolution, mainly in the fields of religion, teacher and
   student knowledge, student maturity, and alternative perceptions. A
   questionnaire distributed among in-service Israeli teachers added
   strength to interviews with the curriculum writers, with both referring
   to some of the same difficulties. However, some difficulties were heard
   only in the interviews. Curriculum writers were more concerned with
   questions of faith that teaching evolution raises, whereas in-service
   teachers were concerned with their students' difficulties in
   understanding natural selection and mutational randomness.
   Teacher-training programs that focus on teachers' lack of evolution
   knowledge and on pedagogical skills, as well as the design of teaching
   materials that take into account these difficulties, are recommended for
   future research.},

Abstract = {The present research inquired about beliefs of in-service and
   pre-service mathematics teachers as well as the analysis and comparison
   between the beliefs that they declare, argue, and reflect in their
   lessons plans, and the use of those beliefs in their practical
   exercises. Five pre-service teachers studying a Bachelor's in
   Mathematics, and three in-service teachers who were Ph.D. candidates in
   Mathematics Education participated in the study. A multiple case study
   was carried out using mixed methods. Closed questionnaires,
   semi-structured interviews, and lesson plans were used as instruments
   for information collection. The obtained data show how participants have
   been structuring their beliefs. Moreover, it was possible to determine
   that in-service teachers have more firm beliefs which were evidenced in
   their classroom proposals, whereas pre-service teachers have more
   tentative beliefs that, in general, do not align with what is evidenced
   through their lesson planners. The training received at the
   undergraduate and postgraduate levels has permeated the formation of
   participants' beliefs which can be evidenced in the obtained results.
   Some implications and suggestions for initial and continuous education
   programs for mathematics teachers and future research suggestions are
   presented.},

Abstract = {This study explores secondary mathematics teachers' attention to the
   three components of Jaworski's (1992) ``teaching triad{''}
   (i.e.,mathematical challenge,learning management, andsensitivity to
   students) as they planned a lesson revolving around a rich mathematics
   problem and assessed pre-designed student solutions for that problem.
   Written work was gathered from 17 cohorts. Qualitative analysis
   generated categories. Quantitative analysis revealed that some
   components of the teaching triad were attended to in both activities,
   some were not attended to in either activity, and some were attended to
   in one activity but not in the other. Findings are interpreted in light
   of theory.},

Abstract = {This study investigates preservice middle school mathematics teachers'
   understanding of statistics and probability and provides a cognitive
   diagnostic assessment of their strengths and weaknesses on these
   subjects. A statistical reasoning test that included 15 multiple-choice
   and 5 open-ended items was developed from the perspective of the
   log-linear cognitive diagnosis model, which is a general form of the
   cognitive diagnosis models. The statistical reasoning test was applied
   to 456 preservice teachers from 4 universities in 3 different regions of
   Turkey. The collected data were analyzed using the Mplus 6.12 software,
   and diagnostic feedback on the preservice teachers' responses was
   provided based on the findings. The analysis suggested that although
   many preservice teachers were able to represent and interpret the given
   data, most experienced difficulty in drawing inferences about
   populations based on samples, selecting and using appropriate
   statistical methods, and understanding and applying the basic concepts
   of probability. In addition, preservice teachers had difficulty
   answering open-ended items. Implications for teaching are also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the common
   knowledge construction model (CKCM)-based instruction on academic
   achievement and 7th grade students' views about the nature of science
   (NOS) presented in electrical energy unit at schools of different
   socio-economic levels. In accordance with this purpose, three secondary
   schools at different socio-economic levels (lower, middle and upper) in
   Kastamonu Province, Turkey, were selected. One experimental group and
   one control group were randomly selected from schools at each
   socio-economic level. The teaching interventions in all groups lasted
   for 6 weeks (24 class-hours). While the lessons of the experimental
   group were taught with the activities developed in accordance with the
   CKCM, the lessons of the control group were taught in compliance with
   the 2013 Science Curriculum. As a result of this study, it was observed
   that the CKCM-based instruction increased students' level of academic
   achievement and ensured the permanence of the knowledge learned. In
   terms of academic achievement, no significant difference was observed
   between the schools at the lower and middle socio-economic levels and
   the schools at middle and upper socio-economic levels. However, a
   significant difference between the schools at the lower and upper
   socio-economic levels was observed in favor of the upper socio-economic
   level school. Moreover, the CKCM-based instruction had a positive effect
   on the students' views on the nature of science.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this case study is to investigate the triggers of
   unexpected (contingent) moments during one in-service primary teacher's
   teaching of the measurement of length and perimeter, to identify this
   teacher's responses to these moments, and to examine how these responses
   change the flow of the measurement of length and perimeter instruction.
   Ten lessons were recorded: the triggers of the contingent moments during
   these lessons were analyzed according to Rowland, Thwaites and Jared's
   (2015) framework and the teacher's responses were analyzed according to
   Stockero and Van Zoest's (Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education,
   16(2), 125-147, 2013) response types. The findings of this study showed
   that the contingent moments in these lessons resulted from the students'
   incorrect answers, questions, and ideas, and the availability of
   materials. Moreover, the analysis of the teacher's responses indicated
   that there were differences in the teacher's spontaneous responses
   during the lessons, both in terms of the different types and the depth
   of the given responses. In addition, the teacher's way of responding
   affected the flow of the measurement of length and perimeter
   instruction.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the effects of the Mathematics, Arts,and Creativity
   in Education (MACE) program on students' ability in geometry and visual
   arts in the upper grades of elementary school. The program consisted of
   a lesson series for fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students in which
   geometry and visual arts were integrated, alongside with a professional
   development program for teachers. A quasi-experimental study was
   conducted in which three groups of teachers and their classes were
   investigated. One group of teachers taught the lesson series and
   followed a professional development program (n = 36), one group of
   teachers only taught the lesson series (n = 36), and a comparison group
   taught a series of traditional geometry lessons from mathematical
   textbooks (n = 43). A geometrical ability, creativity, and vocabulary
   test and a visual arts assignment were used in a pre- and
   post-measurements to test the effects of the MACE program. Results
   showed that students who received the MACE lesson series improved more
   than students who received regular geometry lessons only in geometrical
   aspects perceived in a visual artwork. Regarding students' understanding
   and explanation of geometrical phenomena and geometrical creative
   thinking, all students improved, but no differences between the groups
   were found, which implies that on these aspects the MACE program was as
   effective as the comparison group that received a more traditional form
   of geometry education.},

Abstract = {This study examined the changes that a group of nine Israeli 7th grade
   mathematics teachers, who collaborated on editing the textbook they used
   in class, chose to make in the textbook. Data sources included the
   project website (using a modified wiki-book platform), the group
   meetings, interviews with the teachers, individual papers written by the
   teachers, and a research journal. Data analysis revealed 4 types of
   change that the teachers wittingly and purposely suggested making. Three
   of them comprised changes related to ways suggested in the textbook to
   teaching and learning mathematical content: integrating technological
   tools, re-structuring textbook content presentation, and adding
   materials for students with low achievements. The 4th type of change was
   of a different nature, associated with creating organizing tools
   embedded in the textbook in order to make the textbook user-friendlier.
   The work on the 4 types of change involved 3 kinds of challenge:
   professional, conceptual, and technical.},

Abstract = {This study reports on a way to address twenty-first-century skills in
   mathematics education by organizing one-day mathematics challenges in
   the Netherlands. During such a day, students work in teams in school on
   an open-ended problem which aims to elicit skills like problem-solving,
   modeling, collaboration, and communication. The framework and the
   methodological approach of the maker movement are used to describe and
   analyze the design of these learning spaces for students and the
   practices they become engaged in. In this study, two design teams are
   interviewed and two assignments, including student work, are analyzed.
   The results show that the maker perspective bears similarities with the
   problem-solving perspective, but also enriches the problem-solving
   perspective by emphasizing the importance of tinkering, making
   something, and working as a community of practice. Emerging task
   characteristics that afford students' making processes are the use of a
   context that is meaningful for students, the low-floor-high-ceiling
   character of the open problem, and the request for a product. The extent
   to which the requested product is more context-related or more
   mathematical depends on the intentions of the task and the interest of
   the target group. Maker characteristics of the design teams elicit the
   importance of brainstorms with professionals, time for tinkering with
   the problem situation, and time for exploring possible student
   strategies, before the final assignment is developed.},

Abstract = {Fostering the development of students' critical thinking (CT) is
   regarded as an essential outcome of higher education. However, despite
   the large body of research on this topic, there has been little
   consensus on how educators best support the development of CT. In view
   of some of the controversies surrounding the teaching of CT skills in
   higher education, this study examined the effects of embedding CT
   instruction systematically in domain-specific courses (Immersion vs.
   Infusion) on the acquisition of domain-specific and domain-general CT
   skills and course achievement. First-year university students (N = 143)
   enrolled in an introductory physics course were assigned to one of three
   instructional conditions: Immersion, Infusion, and control. The
   Immersion and Infusion conditions followed lessons designed
   systematically based on the First Principles of Instruction model,
   whereas the control condition followed a regular instruction. Results
   showed that participants in the Immersion and Infusion conditions
   significantly outperformed those in the control condition on
   domain-specific CT proficiency and course achievement. However, neither
   the Immersion nor the Infusion condition was helpful in fostering the
   acquisition of domain-general CT skills. The findings generally
   demonstrated that embedding CT instruction systematically in
   domain-specific courses requires greater clarity about what set of CT
   skills could be targeted in domain-specific instruction, how specific
   subject-matter instruction could be designed considering CT as an
   integral part of domain-specific instruction, and how best CT outcomes
   be assessed. Some considerations for the design of CT-supportive
   learning environments are discussed.},

Abstract = {Reform of mathematics education has been in focus in many countries
   including those in major economic transition. This paper reports a
   segment of a study which was conducted in Bhutan, where a reformed
   elementary mathematics curriculum has been recently introduced. The
   reformed curriculum is based on social constructivism and its design has
   been influenced by the USA's National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
   (NCTM) standards. This paper reports upon the planned teaching of a
   sample of elementary (primary) teachers in their implementation of the
   reformed curriculum. The data for this part of the investigation were
   aggregated from a qualitative survey of randomly selected elementary
   school teachers (N = 72) from 40 schools across the country. A set of 3
   analytical rubrics, based on intentions embedded in the curriculum, was
   developed to analyse the alignment of teachers' planned sample learning
   activities with the intentions of the curriculum. Our conclusions are
   that while the curriculum's intentions might be meaningfully stated in
   the curriculum documents, implementation remains problematic because
   there appears to be a mis-alignment between curriculum intentions and
   classroom practices. For instance, teachers by not adopting
   evidence-based approaches recommended in the curriculum document and are
   continuing to deny students opportunities to achieve deep understanding
   in achieving national priorities. This paper also argues that the
   proposed analytical rubrics may be of value for Bhutanese mathematics
   educators and, with minor modification, educators in other contexts, as
   they critique planned and actual practices.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative effectiveness
   of experimenting with physical manipulatives alone, virtual
   manipulatives alone, and virtual preceding physical manipulatives
   (combination environment) on third-grade students' science achievement
   and conceptual understanding in the domain of state changes of water,
   focusing on the concepts of evaporation and condensation. A
   pretest-posttest design was used that involved 208 third-grade students
   assigned to the three learning conditions. A science achievement test
   and a two-tier conceptual test were administered to students before and
   after a teaching intervention. The results revealed that using virtual
   preceding physical manipulatives and virtual manipulatives alone
   enhanced students' knowledge gains about evaporation and condensation
   greater than the use of physical laboratory activities alone. It was
   also found that the combination environment promoted students' knowledge
   gains about these concepts equally well as the use of virtual laboratory
   activities alone. On the other hand, the results showed that using
   virtual preceding physical manipulatives promoted students' conceptual
   understanding most efficiently compared to the use of either physical or
   virtual manipulatives alone; in contrast, experimenting with physical
   manipulatives alone was least influential for students' conceptual
   understanding compared to the other manipulatives.},

Abstract = {The current study, involving 219 teachers and 15,292 students, examined
   the relationship between teacher participation in a sustained
   professional development intervention designed to improve the quantity
   and quality of guided inquiry-based instruction in middle school science
   classrooms and subsequent student academic growth. Utilizing a
   quasi-experimental design, the growth scores of students of
   participating and non-participating teachers were compared to a
   benchmark measure established by a virtual comparison group (VCG) of
   similarly matched students. The results indicate that for all three MAP
   tests (Scientific Practices, Science Concepts, Science Composite) the
   students of participating teachers had significantly higher than
   expected growth relative to the VCG when compared to students of
   non-participants. In addition, students of teachers who participated in
   the PD intervention consistently exceeded the growth expectations of the
   benchmark VCG by up to 82 \%. This study supports prior research
   findings that inquiry-based instruction helps improve students'
   achievement relative to scientific practices and also provides evidence
   of increasing student conceptual knowledge.},

Abstract = {In this article, attempts were made to examine students' thinking about
   the concepts of infinity and their ideas about transiting from finite to
   infinite states through the concept of limits of sequences. The
   participants included 78 senior high-school students ranging in age
   between 17 and 19 years old. The data were collected through a
   questionnaire and an interview with all of the subjects. The findings
   showed that the students' understanding of infinity is related to finite
   situations and many students consider infinite processes as a
   generalized form of finite processes. In the present study, the most
   common mistakes committed by students were related to consideration of
   infinity as a number and application of known finite results to infinite
   states.},

Title = {Development of a Framework to Characterise the Openness of Mathematical

Abstract = {Educators usually mean different constructs when they speak of open
   tasks: some may refer to pure-mathematics investigative tasks while
   others may have authentic real-life tasks in mind; some may think of the
   answer being open while others may refer to an open method. On the other
   hand, some educators use different terms, e.g. open and open-ended, to
   mean the same construct, while others distinguish between these terms.
   It is difficult to hold a meaningful discussion or to define clearly an
   area of research on open tasks if the idea of what constitutes the
   construct of openness is vague. Moreover, what students learn depends on
   the types of tasks that they are given, and different kinds of tasks
   place differing cognitive demands on students. Thus, the objectives of
   this article are to clarify the types of mathematical tasks and develop
   a framework to characterise their openness based on five task variables:
   goal, method, task complexity, answer and extension; and to discuss how
   different types of tasks and openness may affect student learning. The
   openness framework can help teachers to design or select more
   appropriate tasks to cater to students with different abilities in order
   to develop in them various kinds of mathematical thinking processes, and
   it can also make it easier for researchers to study the interaction
   between different types of openness and student learning.},

Title = {ASSESSING STUDENTS' EXPERIMENTATION PROCESSES IN <i>GUIDED INQUIRY</i>},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {In recent science education, experimentation features ever more strongly
   as a method of inquiry in science classes rather than as a means to
   illustrate phenomena. Ideas and materials to teach inquiry abound. Yet,
   tools for assessing students' achievement in their processes of
   experimentation are lacking. The present study assumes a basal,
   non-exclusive process model of inquiry in experimentation that can be
   considered a consensus from multiple approaches: (1) finding an
   idea/hypothesis, (2) planning and conducting an experiment, and (3)
   drawing conclusions from evidence. The study confronted 339 secondary
   level students with three guided inquiry experimentation tasks on 3
   days. Selected working groups were videotaped while experimenting. All
   the students reported their processes in a structured report form
   simultaneous to their progress. The generated videos and reports were
   analysed in a two-stepped way: (1) Experimentation was coded according
   to the process model into process plots; on basis of these, (2)
   process-focused performance scores were calculated considering logical
   coherence and immediacy of the inquiry processes. Correlative analyses
   show for two of the tasks that the report format yielded comparable
   performance scores to those generated from video data after students
   have had opportunity to learn the surveying formats (r(S)>.80). A first
   suggestion of a process-oriented assessment tool for inquiry in
   experimentation can be drawn from this study. It might be used to inform
   and complement secondary science instruction.},

Abstract = {This study is part of a cross-national research entitled In the past and
   now: Constructivist practices in teaching chemistry-Bulgaria, the
   Balkans and Europe. The purpose of the research is to explore science
   secondary classroom environments in terms of the constructivist
   approach. The study has been carried out at international schools and
   state schools in Albania, Kosovo, Romania and Turkey. The data
   collection methods were three surveys: the What Is Happening In This
   Class? (WIHIC), the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES)
   and the Test of Science-Related Attitudes (TOSRA). The questionnaires
   were given to 747 secondary school students. The results show that in
   the majority of the surveyed classrooms, a blended
   traditional-constructivist type of environment is present. The highest
   scores for all three questionnaires were given by students of the
   international school in Kosovo. The traditional and test-oriented
   teaching in the Turkish schools surveyed explains the low degree of
   satisfaction and enjoyment of science lessons among Turkish students.},

Abstract = {Word problems are math- or science-related problems presented in the
   context of a story or real-life scenario. Literature suggests that, to
   solve these problems, advanced reading skills are required, in addition
   to content-related skills in, for example, mathematics. In the present
   study, we investigated the relation between students' reading ability
   and their achievements in advanced mathematics, physics, and chemistry
   when controlling for their mathematical ability. The study included
   1,446 Dutch secondary school students who had taken their final
   examinations in these subjects. Using multivariate multilevel models, we
   found that both math and reading ability (the latter only in the
   pre-university track) were positively related to the examination grades
   on mathematics, physics, and chemistry. This relation was equally strong
   for boys and girls. This relation was neither moderated by students'
   sex, nor by students' ethnicity (Dutch versus non-Dutch origin).},

Abstract = {Formative assessment practices, including eliciting a broad range of
   student ideas, noticing the nuances in students' ideas, using these
   ideas to guide instruction, and promoting student self-regulation of
   learning are key components of expert teaching. Given the inherent
   dialogical nature of formative assessment in the classroom, video can
   provide a powerful tool for capturing and analyzing teachers' formative
   assessment interactions with students. In this study, we provide a
   framework for examining expertise in formative assessment and use this
   framework to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the practices of
   13 mathematics and science teachers. While we only saw a few instances
   of true expertise in formative assessment practices in our examination
   of videos, our findings indicate that teachers with more expertise in
   formative assessment let students' ideas guide their teaching. This
   leads to higher correlations among the dimensions of practice that we
   articulate in our framework for expert teachers. However, because many
   of the instructional decisions that teachers make are not visible on
   video, video alone may not provide enough information to judge expertise
   in formative assessment.},

Abstract = {The benefits of connecting school students with scientists are well
   documented. This paper reports how New Zealand teachers brought
   scientists into the classrooms through the use of videos of New Zealand
   scientists talking about themselves and their research. Two researchers
   observed lessons in 9 different classrooms in which 23 educational
   videos were shown to students from years 2 to 11 (aged 6-17 years).
   Seven groups of primary students and 4 groups of secondary students
   participated in interviews after classroom observations. Eight
   additional secondary teachers participated in 7 focus group discussions;
   4 additional primary teachers participated in 1 focus group discussion.
   Data were analysed thematically using an inductive approach. This
   analysis uncovered 4 major functions for the use of videos of scientists
   talking about their work: bringing scientists into the classroom,
   scientists talking about science with local relevance, scientists
   explaining concepts using a multitude of modes and scientists as
   authentic alternative authorities within the classroom. Taken together,
   the findings demonstrate that the use of video clips of scientists
   talking about their work can be an effective and efficient way of
   engaging students in learning about science and scientists.},

Abstract = {This study examined student actions, interpretations, and language in
   respect to questions raised regarding tabular, graphical, and algebraic
   representations in the context of functions. The purpose was to
   investigate students' interpretations and specific ways of working
   within table, graph, and the algebraic on notions fundamental to a
   conceptualization of linear functions. Through a case study method which
   investigated individual representations and student articulations within
   them, the study revealed that students can make a transition from a
   given representation of linear function to another and yet demonstrate
   limited understanding of linear functions.},

Abstract = {Considerable resources are spent on initiatives aiming to increase
   achievement and participation in science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM). Drawing on focus group interviews and a
   questionnaire study with participants in ENT3R, a Norwegian
   out-of-school mathematics program, we investigated why participants
   attended and stayed in this program and assessed how it influenced
   participants' STEM motivation. The authors identified 3 aspects of ENT3R
   highlighted by the participants: The instructors provided good teaching,
   the instructors created a positive atmosphere, and the instructors
   engaged in interpersonal relationships. Moreover, drawing on the
   expectancy-value model, the authors found that ENT3R appeared to
   influence 5 factors in the model that are important for STEM motivation:
   expectation of success, interest-enjoyment value, attainment value,
   utility value, and cost. This study points to the importance of
   carefully recruited and trained instructors and of flexible,
   responsively designed extracurricular programs.},

Abstract = {Within the domain of geometry, proof and proof development continues to
   be a problematic area for students. Battista (2007) suggested that the
   investigation of knowledge components that students bring to
   understanding and constructing geometry proofs could provide important
   insights into the above issue. This issue also features prominently in
   the deliberations of the 2009 International Commission on Mathematics
   Instruction Study on the learning and teaching of proofs in mathematics,
   in general, and geometry, in particular. In the study reported here, we
   consider knowledge use by a cohort of 166 Sri Lankan students during the
   construction of geometry proofs. Three knowledge components were
   hypothesised to influence the students' attempts at proof development:
   geometry content knowledge, general problem-solving skills and geometry
   reasoning skills. Regression analyses supported our conjecture that all
   3 knowledge components played important functions in developing proofs.
   We suggest that whilst students have to acquire a robust body of
   geometric content knowledge, the activation and the utilisation of this
   knowledge during the construction of proof need to be guided by general
   problem-solving and reasoning skills.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess students' conceptual learning of
   electricity and magnetism and examine how these conceptions, beliefs
   about physics, and quantitative problem-solving skills would change
   after peer instruction (PI). The Conceptual Survey of Electricity and
   Magnetism (CSEM), Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey
   (CLASS), multiple-choice test was administered as a pre- and posttest
   with Solomon 4 group design to students (N = 138) enrolled on freshman
   level physics course. The number of chapter taught to the students was
   14. Problem-solving strategy steps were asked to students in the exam.
   The analyses of CSEM showed that the treatment group (g = 0.62) obtained
   significantly higher conceptual learning gain than the control group (g
   = 0.36). The conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills of the
   students on magnetism considerably enhanced when PI was conducted (37\%
   and 20\%, respectively). CLASS results for 5 subscales (conceptual
   understanding, applied conceptual understanding, problem solving
   general, problem solving confidence, and problem solving sophistication)
   supported the findings of CSEM.},

Abstract = {This study is a meta-synthesis of 20 action research studies undertaken
   in the classroom by teachers to develop their understanding of an
   innovative strategy for teaching science. The studies were undertaken as
   part of the requirements for their 2-year M.Ed. program from the Aga
   Khan University, Institute for Educational Development (AKU-IED),
   Pakistan. The teachers enrolled in the program are expected to conduct a
   small-scale study as part of their thesis requirement which counts for
   16 credits or 25\% of the program. Twenty studies from a total of 350
   M.Ed. thesis were selected based on specific criteria that they (a) are
   qualitative action research studies, (b) are undertaken by teachers who
   themselves teach in the science classroom, and (c) use an innovative
   strategy for teaching science. The meta-synthesis shows that action
   research contributed to developing understanding in all three domains of
   teacher knowledge: pedagogical knowledge, subject matter knowledge, and
   pedagogical content knowledge. The teacher researchers developed an
   understanding of the theory and practice of the innovative strategy
   implemented and found that the transformation of their science content
   knowledge to ``fit{''} the new ways of teaching was the most challenging
   and rewarding part of their research. They also found that the balance
   between innovative ways of teaching science and current methods of
   assessment was very hard to achieve and created a barrier to the
   acceptance of new methods of teaching.},

Abstract = {This study explores the effect of a conceptual change text on students'
   awareness of common misconceptions on the particle model of matter. The
   conceptual change text was designed based on principles of text
   comprehensibility, of conceptual change instruction and of instructional
   approaches how to introduce the particle model. It was evaluated in an
   empirical study with 214 students. Students' learning was measured with
   a pre-post-test design. Item response theory was used for analysing
   students' answers. We found that reading the criteria-based text
   fostered students' awareness of common misconceptions about the particle
   model and yielded overall improved results as compared to reading a
   traditional text.},

Abstract = {Students find science relevant to society, but they do not find school
   science interesting. This survey study analyzes Finnish grade 9
   students' actual experiences with science teaching methods and their
   preferences for how they would like to study science. The survey data
   were collected from 3,626 grade 9 students (1,772 girls and 1,832 boys)
   across randomly sampled secondary schools. Students were asked to
   evaluate how often a particular teaching method is used in science
   (chemistry and physics) teaching and how often they would like to see
   the teaching method used. Data were analyzed using nonparametric tests.
   Boys seemed to be more satisfied with current and traditional science
   teaching methods like direct teaching, solving basic problems, reading
   textbooks, and conducting practical work, while girls desired more
   discussion. Students who are interested in school science or think that
   school science is relevant in everyday life would like more creative
   activities such as brainstorming and project work. Results indicated
   that understanding the connection between student interest and teaching
   method preferences, especially interpreting interested students' desire
   for creative activities, are important aspects for future research.},

Abstract = {This study examines the didactic suitability of introducing a teaching
   sequence when teaching the concept of magnetic fields within
   introductory physics courses at the university level. This instructional
   sequence was designed taking into account students' common conceptions,
   an analysis of the course content, and the history of the development of
   ideas about magnetic fields. The evaluation is undertaken by comparing
   the results with a control group using written questionnaires and
   analyzing recordings of class discussion. The results show that the
   elements within the sequence help students to reconcile an overall
   description with field analysis of magnetic interactions.},

   experiments and molecular modeling with an emphasis on scientific
   inquiry and case studies. Our research aimed at investigating the effect
   of the CCL and CMM learning environment on students' higher-order
   thinking skills of question posing, inquiry, and modeling. The
   experimental group included 614 honors 12th grade chemistry students
   from high schools in Israel who studied according to this learning unit.
   The comparison group consisted of 155 12th grade chemistry honors
   students who studied other chemistry programs. Pre- and post-tests
   questionnaires were used to assess students' higher-order thinking
   skills. Students' responses were analyzed using content analysis rubrics
   and their statistical analysis. Our findings indicated that the scores
   of the experimental group students improved significantly in question
   posing, inquiry and modeling skills from the pre-test to the post-test.
   The net gain scores of the experimental group students were
   significantly higher than those of their comparison peers in all three
   examined skills. In modeling skills, experimental group students
   significantly improved their achievements in making the transfer from 3D
   models to structural formulae, but only about half of them were able to
   transfer from formulae to 3D models. By presenting a case-based
   chemistry assessment tool and content analysis of students' responses in
   this paper, we enable teachers and educators to analyze their students'
   higher-order thinking skills both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

Title = {School-Level Science and Mathematics Predictors of Precollege Physics
   Enrollment and Performance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 22},
Abstract = {The question of precollege physics access and performance has been a
   persistent concern when considering the goal of diversifying
   participation in post-secondary STEM study and careers. This
   observational study examined school-level academic and demographic
   predictors of high school physics enrollment and performance in the USA.
   Due to the sequential and hierarchical nature of high school science and
   mathematics coursework, related predictors were included in
   multivariable regression and structural equation models to understand
   whether selectivity constrains the STEM pipeline. Descriptive and
   inferential analyses of state-level data were conducted (N = 663 high
   schools enrolling 559,044 students) to define the scope of physics
   enrollment and performance, and the predictive value of ethnicity,
   socioeconomic status, and science and mathematics course enrollments and
   performance. Physics was taken by fewer students when compared to
   biology, earth science, and chemistry. Correlations, multiple
   regression, and structural equation modeling indicated that although
   socioeconomic status was the main predictor of student enrollment in
   physics, this was mediated by schoolwide enrollment in chemistry and
   algebra II as well as schoolwide performance in chemistry and geometry.
   School-level performance in physics was negatively predicted by the
   percentage of students traditionally underrepresented in STEM, yet the
   predictive value was mediated by chemistry and algebra II performance.
   Results suggest that the prevalent science and mathematics sequence
   correlates to diminished physics enrollment, particularly with regard to
   students traditionally marginalized in STEM. US school leaders and
   policy makers should implement more proactive interventions earlier in
   the STEM pipeline to promote diverse physics participation and more
   equitable performance outcomes.},

Abstract = {Identifying the knowledge resources teachers productively and
   unproductively draw upon can provide a means by which to create support
   structures to develop a more robust understanding of the content. To
   provide more informed grade-level support structures in teacher
   education programs, this study examined the knowledge resources 20
   secondary pre-service teachers (PSTs) and 13 elementary PSTs drew upon
   when solving a comparison proportional reasoning problem. Data from
   written work and videos of PSTs' explanations were analyzed using the
   robust understanding of proportional reasoning for teaching framework.
   Both elementary and secondary PSTs ubiquitously drew upon the same four
   knowledge resources (comparison of quantities, ratios, proportional
   situation, and ratio as measure). Elementary PSTs were more apt to
   counterproductively draw upon the knowledge resource ratios not equal
   fractions, while secondary PSTs more often counterproductively drew upon
   equivalence. Mathematics educators can leverage the knowledge resources
   afforded by this task and strategically highlight productive and
   counterproductive resources to tailor instruction that develops PSTs'
   robust understanding of proportional reasoning.},

Abstract = {The BSCS 5E Instructional Model, an elaboration of the well-known and
   accepted three-part learning cycle, is a five-part approach to
   incorporating inquiry-based, active learning in the classroom. Developed
   in 1987 by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, ``the 5Es{''} is a
   popular K-20 instructional practice, and as such, the Biological
   Sciences Curriculum Study has advocated for the empirical study of its
   effectiveness. We present a systematic review of English-language
   peer-reviewed publications of empirical studies of the 5Es for K-20
   mathematics and science teaching and learning. We report our search
   process and analyses, revealing the characteristics of the literature
   found that specifically question the effectiveness of the 5Es: 45
   articles have been published, beginning in 2006, in 33 journals. Of
   those with scores available, the average SCImago Journal \& Country Rank
   was 0.587, and the average Impact Factor was 1.151 for year of
   publication. From our synthesis, we find that the 5Es are more impactful
   than traditional instruction, yet comparisons of the 5Es to the original
   learning cycle predecessor have not been done, and the 5Es are not
   necessarily more effective than other inquiry methods. While dosage does
   not seem to matter in the studies in our corpus, the 5Es are
   particularly studied and found to be positively impactful in secondary
   biology contexts. The relatively few studies with teachers and students
   in mathematics contribute to both a nuanced understanding of some
   limitations of the rest of the data corpus and are areas for future
   research.},

Abstract = {The current US science education reforms call for integrating
   engineering design in science instruction requires teachers to develop
   and teach engineering design-integrated science (EDIS) lessons. However,
   very few teachers have received training in engineering and how to
   integrate engineering design into science lessons. In response to this
   challenge, our teacher education program has been training secondary
   pre-service science teachers in engineering design and how to develop
   EDIS instructional materials. Thus, this study reports on the
   representation of science and engineering practices and engineering
   design skills in the EDIS instructional units developed by participant
   pre-service teachers, in aggregate and by science discipline and by
   different sections within the units. Results show that all science and
   engineering practices and design skills were included in the units.
   However, engineering practices and design skills were covered more than
   science practices in the EDIS instructional units. Pre-service teachers
   did not treat engineering design as an add-on or culminating activity.
   Instead, they planned the units to teach science through engineering
   design process, which was consistent to the model of our intervention,
   and the Next Generation Science Standards. We conclude that instruction
   on engineering design process and how to integrate it in science
   instruction through intensive professional development activities can
   enhance pre-service science teachers' abilities to develop EDIS
   instructional units, even for science subjects like life science.},

Title = {Role of Graphs in Blending Physical and Mathematical Meaning of Partial
   Derivatives in the Context of the Heat Equation},

Abstract = {From literature, we know that making the connections between mathematics
   and physics is not trivial for most students, even at the advanced
   level. In the specific context of partial derivatives in thermodynamics,
   research suggests that making explicit connections between the
   mathematics and the physics is necessary to foster student
   understanding. In this paper, we investigate how graphical reasoning can
   help undergraduate students in making connections between the partial
   derivatives of temperature with respect to position and to time and
   their respective physical meaning in the context of one-dimensional
   systems modeled by the heat equation. We conducted task-based, think
   aloud interviews with four pairs of undergraduate students majoring in
   physics or mathematics and use dynamic conceptual blending diagrams to
   analyze their reasoning processes and the role of the graphs therein.
   The results in this paper indicate that stimulating graphical reasoning
   is a promising way to promote the blending of mathematical and physical
   knowledge. Specifically, our data shows that constructing graphs can be
   a catalyst which helps students to give physical meaning to the partial
   derivatives partial derivative T/partial derivative t and/or partial
   derivative T/partial derivative x. Therefore, in teaching/learning
   activities, actively promoting graph construction and reasoning based on
   those graphs offers perspectives to support the blending of mathematics
   and physics.},

Abstract = {Pre-service mathematics teachers (PSTs) enter university with diverse
   beliefs and understandings of teaching and learning; yet, they may not
   be aware of how these conceptions are related to their epistemological
   and efficacy beliefs. This study explored how the mathematical beliefs,
   mathematics self-efficacy, and mathematics teaching efficacy of PSTs
   predict their teaching and learning conceptions. Participants were 80
   PSTs (59.7\% men and 40.3\% women) who were studying in a 5-year
   full-time undergraduate degree program at a comprehensive research
   university in Hong Kong. Multiple regression analyses were performed to
   investigate the relationships between the PSTs' teaching and learning
   conceptions and various predictors. The results indicated that
   mathematical beliefs and personal mathematics teaching efficacy, a
   component of mathematics teaching efficacy, predicted traditional
   conceptions. Mathematics self-efficacy and mathematics teaching outcome
   expectancy, another component of mathematics teaching efficacy,
   predicted constructivist conceptions. This study yields insights into
   the different roles of mathematical beliefs, mathematics self-efficacy,
   and mathematics teaching efficacy in explaining and predicting the
   teaching and learning conceptions among PSTs, which demonstrates the
   potential to inform and improve PSTs' professional learning and
   development.},

Abstract = {Quality STEM teacher education is predicated on teacher educators who
   are well-equipped to design learning experiences, provide feedback,
   guide the development of teachers across their career span, and conduct
   rigorous research to advance education theory and praxis. While numerous
   models and approaches to professional development for teachers exist,
   few parallels can be drawn between the professional development of
   teachers and teacher educators (Loughran, 2014). To support the
   multi-faceted identity (trans)formation of STEM teacher educators,
   self-directed learning opportunities can help bridge knowledge and
   practice, enhance productive collaboration, and support efforts to
   negotiate multiple and conflicting agendas (Goodwin \& Kosnik, 2013).
   The purpose of this empirical study was to explore the identity
   (trans)formation of teacher educators participating in a long-term
   interdisciplinary STEM-based Community of Practice (CoP; Wenger, 1998),
   which began in 2012. An analysis of our experiences through the figured
   worlds lens informs how a CoP can impact curricular approaches and
   teacher PD, imploring members to move through their comfort zones into
   innovative spaces. We conclude with suggestions for our STEM teacher
   educator colleagues who seek opportunities to challenge their own
   positions and best support preservice and in-service STEM teachers in a
   way that allows them to model for their students the value of community.},

Abstract = {This study explores teacher educators' (TEs') activity as they support
   mathematics and science teacher collaboration in co-designing and
   jointly implementing tasks. We view TEs' activity through the lens of
   Activity Theory and expansive learning and draw evidence from data
   generated within the mascil project that linked mathematics and science
   teaching with workplace situations through inquiry-based teaching. We
   focus on five TEs' actions and goals, use data from their professional
   development sessions with teachers and from the TEs' interactions during
   their own meetings, and highlight the illuminating case of one teacher
   educator. We trace evidence indicating paths of actions followed by each
   Teacher Educator and look for indications of their professional
   learning. Our analysis reveals generic and content-focused actions. All
   TEs faced different kinds of contradictions and had difficulties
   handling them. In terms of professional learning, all TEs adapted their
   prior teacher education practices and appreciated the critical role of
   epistemological differences between the two disciplines.},

Title = {Facilitating Conceptual Growth of the Mainstreamed Students with

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a science experimental guidebook
   for the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities and investigate
   its effect on their conceptual understanding of physical events. Through
   case study research methodology, the sample of the study consisted of 12
   mainstreamed students with learning disabilities. To collect data, a
   conceptual understanding test, a drawing test, and interviews were used.
   The data were analyzed using four categories (sound understanding,
   partial understanding, alternative understanding, and no understanding).
   The results showed that the guidebook positively affected conceptual
   understanding of the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities.
   Even though the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities tended
   to comprehend related concepts through hands-on and minds-on
   activities/experiences, they still had some problems at transferring
   their gained knowledge to novel situations. Moreover, the results
   indicated that the mainstreamed students with learning disabilities were
   more successful in expressing their thoughts with drawings than the
   conceptual understanding test and interviews. The present study suggests
   that future studies should implement interdisciplinary approaches that
   intertwine special education with science education, mathematics
   education, and reading-writing practices.},

Abstract = {Teachers' beliefs play a significant role in students' academic
   attainment and career choices. Despite comparable attainment levels
   between genders, persistent stereotypes and beliefs that certain
   disciplines require innate ability and that men and women have different
   ability levels impede students' academic career paths. In this study, we
   examined the prevalence of US mathematics teachers' explicit general and
   gender-specific beliefs about mathematical ability and identified which
   teacher characteristics were associated with these beliefs. An analysis
   of data from 382 K-8 teachers in the USA indicated that overall,
   teachers disagreed with the idea that general and gender-specific
   mathematical ability is innate and agreed with the idea that hard work
   and dedication are required for success in mathematics. However, our
   findings indicate that those who believed mathematics requires
   brilliance also tended to think girls lacked this ability. We also found
   that teachers who were teaching mathematics to 11- to 14-year-old
   students seemed to believe that mathematics requires innate ability
   compared with teachers who were teaching mathematics to 5- to
   10-year-old students. In addition, more experienced teachers and
   teachers who worked with special education students seemed to believe
   less in the role of hard work in success in mathematics, which could
   have serious consequences for shaping their students' beliefs about
   their academic self-concept and future career-related decisions.},

Abstract = {The published study of Nurrenbern and Pickering in 1987 raises awareness
   among chemistry educators that students' success in answering numerical
   questions does not necessarily reflect their degree of understanding of
   the related chemical concepts. Efforts have been made to provide more
   opportunities for students to improve their ability in answering
   pictorial questions in many studies in the hope that this will explore
   their conceptual understanding. The aim of this study was to examine the
   difference between students' ability to answer algorithmic and pictorial
   type questions of equivalent content and level in the area of chemical
   kinetics. The respondents involved in this study were 335 Indonesian and
   UK university chemistry students. Equivalent algorithmic and pictorial
   question pairs in the topic of chemical kinetics were designed within a
   four-tier instrument. The results confirm that students' ability to
   respond to the two types of questions is significantly different. The
   scores obtained by students in the two types of questions indicate that
   students' performance in algorithmic questions is better than their
   performance in pictorial questions. The implications for teaching and
   learning chemical kinetics are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Research suggests that teachers of mathematics are frequently reluctant
   to pose challenging tasks to students. Reasons for this reluctance
   include fears of negative student reactions, time and resource
   constraints, and a lack of relevant teacher content knowledge. The
   current study involved interviewing three early primary-grade
   (elementary) teachers to explore their perceptions of teaching with
   challenging tasks, following their observations of 2units of
   mathematical work taught by the first author. Contrary to some other
   studies where classroom teachers were themselves observed teaching with
   such tasks and asked to reflect on the experience, we found that
   teacher-participants perceived that students responded positively to the
   2units of work. Specifically, teacher-participants described their
   students as autonomous, persistent and highly engaged. These positive
   student reactions were attributed to a variety of factors, including a
   classroom culture that embraced struggle, high teacher expectations, and
   consistent classroom routines. Despite these positive reflections,
   teacher-participants differed in their views of whether challenging
   tasks are a suitable means of differentiating instruction, with such
   evaluations apparently linked to how they defined student success.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigate sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students'
   achievement in nonlinear (quadratic or cubic) proportional problems
   regarding length, area, and volume of enlarged figures. In addition, we
   examine students' solution strategies for the problems and obstacles
   that prevent students from answering the problems correctly by using a
   mixed method research design. A total of 935 middle school students were
   given a paper-pencil test and 12 of them were interviewed. Findings
   indicated that achievement of the participants were low and that
   students used a limited number of strategies for solving the problems.
   In addition, these strategies were found to have lacked the argument of
   the linear proportional and nonlinear proportional relationships among
   length, area, and volume concepts for most of the participants' answers.
   Moreover, analysis revealed that the confusion of linear proportional
   and nonlinear proportional relationships and misinterpretation of
   additive and multiplicative relationships were serious obstacles while
   solving the nonlinear proportional problems related to the area and
   volume of enlarged figures.},

Abstract = {Research on the impact of the integration of technologies such as iPads
   on primary students' attitudes and engagement in mathematics is limited.
   Further, there have been claims that teachers' pedagogical choices can
   strongly influence the effectiveness of iPads for engaging students in
   mathematics. This paper presents an investigation of the influence of
   teaching and learning mathematics with iPads on students' attitudes and
   engagement in mathematics. The participants in this study were students
   in a large urban primary school, implementing an iPad program for
   teaching and learning across the curriculum. Surveys with five-point
   Likert-type items were used to measure students' attitudes to
   mathematics. Students from Years 2 to 6 completed the survey at the
   beginning and end of two consecutive school years. Survey results
   suggested that iPad use in mathematics has the potential to impact
   positively on students' attitudes to mathematics. At the end of the
   second year of the study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with
   teachers and students. The interview responses confirmed that iPads had
   a positive influence on students' engagement and attitudes to
   mathematics, and that the pedagogical approaches utilised by teachers
   for embedding iPads in their mathematics lessons contributed positively
   to these outcomes.},

Abstract = {In this work, we present a teaching-learning sequence on colour intended
   to a pre-service elementary teacher programme informed by History and
   Philosophy of Science. Working in a socio-constructivist framework, we
   made an excursion on the history of colour. Our excursion through
   history of colour, as well as the reported misconception on colour helps
   us to inform the constructions of the teaching-learning sequence. We
   apply a questionnaire both before and after each of the two cycles of
   action-research in order to assess students' knowledge evolution on
   colour and to evaluate our teaching-learning sequence. Finally, we
   present a discussion on the persistence of deep-rooted alternative
   conceptions.},

Abstract = {Laboratory work, particularly the latest remote laboratories (RLs), has
   been assumed to have a general positive effect on science education
   because practical work can provide diverse learning experiences and
   enhance thinking skills suitable for the 21(st) century. However, there
   has not been a synthesis of the science education research to support
   this assumption. The objective of this study is to systematically review
   the growth of educational research on laboratory work, particularly in
   RLs, utilizing a series of review processes with innovative software for
   visualizing structural relationships. The combined use and support of
   HistCite and CiteSpace software enabled the visualization of the
   citation structure and history of articles. The findings revealed that
   RLs were a state-of-the-art subset of laboratory work and a new way of
   conducting laboratory work that has gained fairly wide research
   attention in engineering education over the past two decades. Thus, this
   innovative literature review process has established a solid background
   for future research and development efforts on RLs in science education
   dealing with scientific and engineering practices.},

Abstract = {A physics textbook for the 8th grade was analyzed, in particular the
   section on the interaction between electric current and magnetic field.
   The textbook is written in the Macedonian language, but is translated
   into Albanian, Serbian, and Turkish, which provides an opportunity to
   influence a larger population of children, in a larger ethnic area.
   Errors are found from both a didactic as well as from a physical point
   of view. The authors create many sources of misconceptions. The
   questions at the end of the chapter are of low level, according to
   Bloom's taxonomy. They are of the first and second levels mostly. In
   very rare cases, third-level questions can be found. The proposed
   experimental activities do not follow the safety precautions and are
   therefore dangerous to perform. Risk assessment of the laboratory
   activities is proposed.},

Abstract = {A teacher-centered, examination-driven instructional approach
   emphasizing knowledge of facts and standard methods through
   drill-and-practice without use of Information and Communications
   Technology (ICT) is still dominant in Nepalese high schools. In this
   article, we present a classroom study in which the traditional
   instructional approach has been replaced by an ICT-rich,
   student-centered, investigative approach in the context of teaching and
   learning basic concepts of reflection and rotation. Here, ICT refers to
   dynamic geometry software. Through a pretest-posttest control and
   experimental group research design, we compared the effects of both
   approaches on students' understanding. A test was designed and used for
   investigating students' alternative conceptions of reflection and
   rotation. The results showed that the experimental group outperformed
   the control group and there were indications of a lasting effect.
   Qualitative analysis indicated that all distinctive aspects of the
   experimental approach had positive effects on the students' performance
   and learning experience. This study can also be considered as an
   evidence-based example of how one can, with limited ICT facilities,
   still achieve improvements in teaching and learning at a public high
   school in a developing country.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated the antecedents and consequences of
   children's math anxiety and math attitude. A total of 595 students aged
   10 to 15 years (5th to 10th grades) and 1 parent of each (mother or
   father) participated in the study. The study was conducted in India,
   with the study sample drawn from schools in South-West Punjab. Math
   anxiety of parents and their children was measured using the Mathematics
   Anxiety Scale Short Version (MARS-SV), the Mathematics Anxiety Scale for
   Elementary School Students (MARS-E), and the Mathematics Anxiety Rating
   Scale for Adolescents (MARS-A). Math attitude was assessed with the
   Attitude Towards Mathematics Inventory (ATMI). A math achievement test
   was constructed for each grade level based on their curriculum. Path
   analyses were conducted to test the suggested conceptual model, and the
   results indicate that parental math anxiety and math attitude act as
   precursors to their children's math anxiety and math attitude and
   further influence the math achievement of their children.},

Abstract = {This study assessed the relation between long-term memory retrieval and
   mathematics calculation and mathematics problem solving achievement
   among elementary, middle, and high school students in nationally
   representative sample of US students, when controlling for fluid and
   crystallized intelligence, short-term memory, and processing speed. As
   hypothesized, structural equation modeling comparing elementary school
   students and middle and high school students revealed that long-term
   retrieval skills became a better predictor of both mathematics
   calculation and mathematics problem solving as age and grade increased.
   Future research should focus on the effectiveness of interventions to
   improve long-term retrieval skills in general, and arithmetic facts
   retrieval and problem solving procedures in particular, at all grades,

Abstract = {This study seeks to develop a better understanding of the
   underrepresentation of women in science and engineering by analyzing the
   gender gaps (a) in the interest in pursuing a science degree and (b) on
   science achievement. We use national-level college admissions data to
   examine gender differences and to explore the association between these
   outcomes and the attendance to single-sex or co-educational schools. The
   Chilean college admissions system provides a unique context to study
   these gender differences, since applicants who wish to pursue an
   undergraduate degree in science or engineering are required to take a
   high-stakes standardized science achievement test as part of the
   admission battery. This test has three subjects: biology, physics, and
   chemistry, and applicants must choose to be tested in only one of them.
   Significant gender differences exist for the examinees in their choice
   of subject and achievement on (the tests). Gender gaps favoring males
   are observed in the three forms. Both interest and achievement in
   science are associated with the sex composition of the school attended.},

Abstract = {How can classrooms become communities of inquiry that connect
   intellectually challenging science content with language-based
   activities (opportunities to talk, listen, read, and write) especially
   in settings with diverse populations? This question guided a 3-year
   mixed-methods research study using the Science Writing Heuristic (SWH)
   approach in cooperation with 2 universities, area education agencies, 6
   school districts, 32 elementary teachers, and over 700 students each
   year. The participating teachers engaged in a yearly summer institute,
   planned units, implemented this curriculum in the classroom, and
   contributed to ongoing data collection and analysis. Findings
   demonstrate that critical embedded language opportunities contribute to
   an increase in student Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) scores in
   science and language based on level of implementation particularly for
   elementary students who receive free and reduced lunch (an indicator of
   living at the poverty level).},

Abstract = {It has become increasingly recognized that what teachers and students
   value affect teaching and learning in general and in the area of
   mathematics in particular. Yet, the extent to which this is so varies
   across cultural regions. In recent years, how the ethnic Chinese teach
   and learn mathematics has attracted much attention worldwide. It is
   precisely the purpose of the present study to investigate the value
   structures of three Chinese regions. Using a recently developed and
   validated questionnaire, students' values in mathematics learning in the
   Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan are delineated. In the first
   place, the results reveal that there are six dimensions in the students'
   value structure, namely achievement, relevance, practice, communication,
   information and communications technology as well as feedback. However,
   in each of the six value components derived from the principal
   components analysis, statistically significant differences between the
   regions were found.},

Abstract = {Theoretically, it has been argued that a conscious understanding of
   metacognitive knowledge requires that this knowledge is explicit and
   systematic. The purpose of this descriptive study was to obtain a better
   understanding of explicitness and systematicity in knowledge of the
   mathematical problem-solving process. Eighteen 11th-grade pre-university
   students solved two kinds of complex mathematical thinking problems that
   included the finding of a solution and the writing of mathematical texts
   and arguments. They also answered open-ended questions to obtain
   reasoned and reflective accounts regarding their metacognitive
   knowledge. Content analysis indicated 4 levels of explicitness and 5
   levels of systematicity. Quantitizing of the accounts provided for a
   strong positive correlation with mathematical performance. It is
   concluded that explicitness and systematicity appeared to be potential
   indicators of the participants' understanding of effective
   problem-solving strategies.},

Abstract = {Student attitudes toward mathematics play an important role in the
   teaching and learning processes of mathematics as positive attitudes
   correlate with higher student achievement. This paper aims to develop
   and explore the validity of a Chinese version of the short attitudes
   toward mathematics inventory (short ATMI) for Taiwanese undergraduates,
   and further to examine the measurement invariance across gender. The
   results suggest that, based on the Taiwanese sample, the model with some
   items excluded has better fit indices than the original model. The
   generalization of the four-factor construct was also confirmed. The
   Cronbach's alpha for total and subscales of the modified short ATMI were
   satisfactory, and moreover, convergent and discriminant validity were
   shown. Finally, measurement invariance of the inventory across gender
   was also demonstrated. This study suggests that the Chinese version of
   the short ATMI is a reliable, valid, and compact instrument that quickly
   and efficiently measures student attitudes toward mathematics.},

Title = {CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 1998-2012 EMPIRICAL STUDIES IN SCIENCE READING USING
   A SELF-REGULATED LEARNING LENS},

Abstract = {There is an increasing interest in conducting reading-related studies in
   science education using a self-regulated learning (SRL) lens. This
   exploration involved a content analysis of 34 articles (38 studies in
   total) in highly regarded journals from 1998 to 2012 using an SRL
   interpretative framework to reveal critical features and relationships
   in the science reading research. A cross-study comparison revealed that
   most researchers had applied mixed methods approaches (68 \%), used
   instructional cues as an intervention (47 \%), and collected both
   performance and process data (50 \%). The summary figures indicated that
   a variety of instructional cues had different effects on science reading
   and SRL strategies and that there were interactions between task
   conditions and cognitive conditions. Customized or personalized
   metacognitive prompts are especially useful for comprehending hypertexts
   and conducting online information searches. Based on the findings, it
   was suggested that future research should apply the COPES model for SRL
   to design instructional cues for learners and to investigate how
   external task conditions influence cognitive conditions, self-regulated
   processes, and reading performance across different science text genres.},

Title = {LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IN VIETNAMESE PHYSICS TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMME

Abstract = {Constructivism was introduced to Vietnam through many ways such as
   workshops, books, the Internet, and so on. However, due to the lack of
   professional education, fundamental ideas of constructivist learning
   perhaps were missing or neglected through classroom activities.
   Furthermore, due to the influence of culture and society, Vietnamese
   constructivism certainly has its own agenda. This paper adapted the
   Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES) which was originally
   developed by Taylor and Fraser (1991) to investigate the classroom
   environment in a Physics Teacher Education programme in Vietnam, as well
   as to illustrate Vietnamese teacher educators' views in employing
   constructivist learning. Fifteen teaching periods in seven different
   classrooms were observed, and five teacher educators from those classes
   were interviewed. Participants are lecturers and bachelor students of
   the Physics Teacher Education programme at Can Tho University, Mekong
   Delta region, south of Vietnam. Results showed that all five scales of
   the CLES in these classrooms are at the intermediate level. All the
   lecturers indicated positive attitudes about constructivism and have
   certain methods to perform these constructivist issues in their classes,
   but they have problems in practical instructional strategies for some
   scales. Therefore, we suggest that professional development programmes
   on how to apply constructivist theory, based on each particular scale of
   the CLES, are essential. This is especially true in scientific
   uncertainty, critical voice, and shared control. Yet, in a country that
   highly appreciates Confucianism with social order, not all aspects of an
   ideal constructivist learning environment should be equally improved.
   Generally, we believe that constructivist learning will be a key answer
   to the problem of the generally passive learning style in Vietnam.},

Abstract = {In current textbook analysis research, there is a strong focus on the
   content, structure and expectation presented by the textbook as elements
   for analysis. This research moves beyond such foci and proposes a
   framework for textbook language analysis which is intended to be
   integrated into an overall framework for mathematics textbook analysis.
   The language of mathematics plays a pivotal role in mathematics
   classrooms and textbooks worldwide. However, because of the complexity
   of this language, generic methods of language analysis are insufficient
   to effectively evaluate the language of mathematics as it is used in
   mathematics textbooks. This paper presents a framework for mathematics
   textbook language analysis. In support of the proposed framework, the
   paper also presents an initial application of this framework by means of
   an analysis of the language (English) in lower-level Irish secondary
   school mathematics textbooks. While this study is based in an Irish
   context, the framework and findings will be of interest to an
   international audience particularly those interested in textbook
   analysis and the language of mathematics and will add value to research
   in this area.},

Abstract = {In this study, we explored the extent to which Australian, Chinese, and
   Korean middle school students perceived themselves to have scientific
   literacy as global citizens and attempted to identify differences and/or
   commonalities in their perceptions. A total of 655 middle school
   students (8th and 9th grades; 358 girls and 297 boys) from the three
   countries participated in the study. We used Global Scientific Literacy
   Questionnaires (GSLQ) as a survey instrument to assess the students'
   perceptions. The GSLQ was developed based on a conceptual framework of
   Scientific Literacy suggested by Choi, Kim, Lee, Mun, Choi, Krajcik \&
   Shin (2011) and Choi, Lee, Shin, Kim \& Krajcik (Journal of Research in
   Science Teaching, 48(6), 670-697, 2011) for citizenship education in the
   21st century. The results indicated that most of the students from the
   three countries showed a tendency toward higher scores for Science as
   human endeavor; the lowest scores were in Meta-cognition and
   self-direction. A pattern of gender difference was also examined among
   the three countries. We suggest future research questions based on a
   cross-cultural perspective in order to explore the reasons for the
   existence of these similarities and differences.},

Abstract = {This study extends current research on the refutation text effect by
   investigating it in learners with different levels of working memory
   capacity. The purpose is to outline the link between online processes
   (revealed by eye fixation indices) and off-line outcomes in these
   learners. In science education, unlike a standard text, a refutation
   text acknowledges readers' alternative conceptions about a topic,
   refutes them, and presents scientific conceptions as viable
   alternatives. Lower and higher memory span university students with
   alternative conceptions about the topic read either a refutation or a
   non-refutation text about tides. Off-line measures of learning revealed
   that both groups of refutation text readers attained higher knowledge
   gains. During the reading process, refutation text readers fixated for
   longer on the refutation segments while reading the parts presenting the
   scientific information (look-froms). Non-refutation text readers looked
   back to the informational parts for longer. Look-froms (positively) and
   reading time (negatively) predicted learning from refutation text,
   indicating that the quality, not quantity, of reading was related to it.
   In contrast, learning from non-refutation text was predicted only by
   working memory capacity. The refutation effect is discussed and
   educational implications are drawn.},

Title = {TEACHING FOR STATISTICAL LITERACY: UTILISING AFFORDANCES IN REAL-WORLD
   DATA},

Abstract = {It is widely held that context is important in teaching mathematics and
   statistics. Consideration of context is central to statistical thinking,
   and any teaching of statistics must incorporate this aspect. Indeed, it
   has been advocated that real-world data sets can motivate the learning
   of statistical principles. It is not, however, a straightforward task to
   take a real-world example and incorporate it into a lesson that will
   teach important statistical principles. This paper considers issues
   involved in using real data to exemplify statistical ideas and examines
   pre-service teachers' attempts to design teaching activities using such
   data. Pre-service teachers were supplied with a topical data set and
   asked to plan lessons that would teach some key statistical idea to year
   6 students. The lessons were analysed using a hierarchy for teaching
   statistical literacy, and great variation was found in the level of
   statistical thinking demanded in the planned lessons. Teachers who had
   completed a preliminary activity helping them to think carefully about
   what might be taught from real data in general produced lessons with
   stronger statistical content. A key requirement for having lessons with
   deep consideration of statistical ideas is to identify the actual
   affordances for teaching contained within a data set; the planning
   process then benefits from explicit attention to making that content
   evident in the teaching activities.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify the degree to which college
   algebra students' value mathematical skills in their prospective
   careers. A survey was administered to N = 144 students in 6 college
   algebra classes at a mid-sized doctoral granting university. Students in
   half the classes completed a data analysis project, and half of the
   students planned to major in a business-related degree. Logistic
   regression suggested that students held mostly positive attitudes about
   the value of mathematics in their career, with business students
   expressing more positive attitudes than those reported by non-business
   students. Unexpectedly, those who completed the data analysis project
   expressed less positive attitudes on 6 of the 20 survey items.},

Abstract = {If children are engaged in science lessons, their learning is likely to
   be better and, in the long term, careers in science and technology will
   remain open. Given that attitudes can develop early and be difficult to
   change, it is important for teachers of younger children to know how to
   foster engagement in science. This study identified what a cohort of 79
   pre-service teachers in England considered to be engaging elementary
   science lessons and compared their notions with teacher behaviours known
   to be conducive to engagement. First, all brought beliefs about how to
   engage children in science lessons to their training. They tended to
   favour children's hands-on activity as an effective means of fostering
   attentive participation in learning, although many had additional ideas.
   Nevertheless, the means and ends of their `pedagogies of engagement'
   tended to be simple and narrow. Trainers need to ensure that notions of
   engagement are wide enough to cope with a variety of teaching
   situations, as when hands-on experience is not feasible, effective or
   appropriate. At the same time, teachers will need to recognise that one
   approach may not suit all learners. Without this, there is the risk that
   they will lack the skills to engage children in science. Nevertheless,
   these beliefs could offer a useful starting point for trainers who wish
   to widen pre-service teachers' conceptions of engagement and increase
   their repertoire of teaching behaviours.},

Abstract = {Evidence-based policies, decisions, and practices are highly valued and
   underachieved in the international mathematics and science education
   reforms. Many in the mathematics and science education research
   communities lament the lack of influence that research results have on
   the education profession, schools, and teaching. Academic research done
   in isolation of end-users-with the faint hope that teachers,
   politicians, and bureaucrats will access and utilise these results to
   inform curriculum, assessment, and instruction and to influence public
   policy-has not worked. Some funding agencies require dissemination of
   research and development results to the broader political and education
   communities; therefore, applicants agree to these requirements without
   fully realizing the breadth of these demands. However, to achieve such
   knowledge transfer requirements, researchers need to become more (a)
   aware of the needs, players, and processes of `speaking truth to power';
   (b) active in knowledge transfer and influencing public policy; and (c)
   alert to values and normative premises of the policy makers. This
   article outlines the essential principles, barriers within the academic
   community, international efforts, and future considerations for
   knowledge transfer regarding international assessments. Specific
   articles on PISA 2000, 2003, and 2006 included in this special issue are
   used to illustrate these insights into verification of curricular
   influences, educational opportunity and equality, regional comparisons,
   and direct influence on policy.},

Abstract = {A qualitative case study was conducted to investigate the classroom
   experiences of three sixth-grade teachers and their mathematics coach as
   they worked with new instructional materials during the implementation
   of a new state-mandated curriculum based on performance standards in
   mathematics. Teachers' collective participation in the exploration of
   the new standards, selection of materials, participation in a summer
   professional development workshop specifically tied to the use of the
   new materials, and the creation of an in-school professional development
   program were catalysts in the teachers' perception of the need to change
   their practice. The intended state-level standards were implemented with
   some success; however, despite their desire to change their practice and
   in contrast to their belief that considerable change had occurred, the
   data suggest that the change in the teachers' instructional practice was
   minimal.},

Abstract = {This study explores the mental images at the microscopic level of matter
   created by 22 preservice science teachers in Oman. Participants were
   encouraged during a guided imagery session to construct mental images
   for a scenario written about the explanation of the reaction of sodium
   in water. They were then asked to describe what they envisioned in their
   own imagination. Participants had images that were based on textbook
   illustrations, modeling kits, a solar-system model, physical properties,
   and humanized animations. 3D mental images represented 33.36\% of
   participants' mental images at the microscopic level, while images in 2D
   format formed 39.15\% of the overall created mental images. Several
   factors shaped the participants' mental images, such as their
   imaginative ability, attention mode, and the nature of their old images
   stored in their long-term memory. Most of the participants experienced
   image transformation from one form to another as they were progressing
   in the GI session. This unstable reliance on different models might
   indicate unorganized conceptual networks in learners' LTM: a feature
   that characterizes novices' mental networking. On the contrary, past
   research has revealed that experts have more organized and sophisticated
   conceptual networking. This study argued that participants lacked the
   homogeneous and reliable mental model of the atom that is required to
   carry out advanced cognitive processes for mental exploration of
   chemical phenomena. The absence of this mental model might explain the
   overwhelming finding in literature that many learners fail to explain
   and predict chemical phenomena.},

Abstract = {Teaching and learning approaches in ecology very often follow linear
   conceptions of ecosystems. Empirical studies with an ecological focus
   consistent with existing syllabi and focusing on cognitive achievement
   are scarce. Consequently, we concentrated on a classroom unit that
   offers learning materials and highlights the existing complexity rather
   than following linear conceptions. We developed an educational unit
   consisting of 14 individual lessons ({''}ecosystem lake{''}) with the
   aim of increasing pupils' cognitive achievement in 8th and 9th grade
   secondary schools. To evaluate our approach, we chose a
   quasi-experimental design and five teachers with ten classes
   participated in our study. A matched-pair tandem-design was provided by
   five German teachers using first his/her conventional approach in one
   class (instruction-1; control group) and second, our modern ecological
   approach in their second class (instruction-2). Pupils subjected to the
   latter performed better, i.e., achieved higher scores, especially in the
   delayed post-test. Further, we found a teacher effect and an interaction
   between treatment (i.e., whether treatment or control class) and the
   teacher regarding the class test. Teachers had a significant influence
   on the learning outcome irrespective of the educational unit, i.e., some
   teachers generally produced higher achievement than others. Further, the
   interaction showed that some teachers coped better with their
   traditional teaching. Nevertheless, in retention (delayed post-test) all
   classes of the modern approach scored higher than the traditionally
   taught ones. Boys and girls benefited equally from our program and
   pupils from the modern approach rated the educational unit better.},

Title = {Exploring the Effects of Technology-Related Informal Mathematics
   Learning Activities: A Structural Equation Modeling Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 15},
Abstract = {Despite the burgeoning adoption of informal learning in people's daily
   lives, the actual effects of informal learning activities, especially
   technology-related informal learning activities, are much less reported
   than those of formal learning. Furthermore, there is a notable lack of
   research on the effects of technology-related informal mathematics
   learning activities (TRLA). This study aims to propose and validate a
   new model which illustrates the effects of TRLA on four constructs:
   mathematics self-efficacy (MSE), mathematics interest (MI),
   self-regulation in mathematics learning (SR), and teacher-student
   relationship (TSR). Adopting a quantitative cross-sectional survey
   approach, 460 students were investigated. The data were analyzed
   employing two-step structural equation modeling. Our findings
   demonstrate the direct effects of TRLA on MI and SR as well as the
   indirect effects on MI, MSE, and TSR. This study advances the
   understanding of technology-enhanced informal learning, which is an
   emerging perspective of technology-enhanced learning.},

Title = {How Do Secondary-School Teachers Design STEM Teaching-Learning
   Sequences? A Mixed Methods Study for Identifying Design Profiles},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 12},
Abstract = {Due to the increasing presence of the Science, Technology, Engineering,
   and Mathematics (STEM) education paradigm in Spain, many teachers have
   embarked on the design of specific Teaching-Learning Sequences (TLS) to
   be implemented in schools. Understanding the views and perceptions about
   STEM that take shape in specific teachers' designs should enrich the way
   in which STEM education is designed based on a more focused approach.
   This study aims to characterise how secondary school teachers from
   Catalonia (Spain) design STEM TLS, to identify specific design profiles
   that can be related to different understandings of STEM education based
   on a mixed-method analytical approach. We collected 345 canvases from
   teachers participating in a national STEM education training programme,
   outlining STEM TLS. The canvases were analysed with an assessment rubric
   consisting of 8 instructional components (Interdisciplinarity, STEM
   practices, Information and Communications Technology tools,
   Formalisation, Openness, Alignment, Authenticity and Values). We
   identified patterns in teachers' designs while implementing a
   hierarchical cluster analysis of the results, obtaining 6 different
   clusters of 39, 36, 66, 49, 90, and 65 TLS, respectively. The diverse
   components prioritised or balanced in each cluster suggest how STEM
   education can be conceived of differently by participating teachers
   through the lens of component analysis. While authenticity appears to be
   a major force in the clustering process, direct relationships between
   components can be found (i.e., between Formalisation and Alignment), as
   well as inverse relationships (i.e., between Openness and Practices).
   These findings provide important clues to understand STEM TLS design and
   recognise the rubric and the cluster definition as powerful tools for
   teacher training and evaluation in STEM education.},

Title = {Using Self-Determination Theory to Explain How Community-Based Learning

Abstract = {Real-world problems serve as authentic learning contexts for students to
   integrate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   knowledge, enhancing their interest and fostering their identity in
   STEM. Primary school students' unfamiliarity with real-world problems
   can be addressed through community engagement; however, research in this
   area is insufficient. This study used self-determination theory (SDT) to
   examine and explain the effect of community engagement on student STEM
   interest and identity development. The mixed-methods sequential
   explanatory design was adopted, and two experimental groups were set up:
   community engagement (CE; N = 72) and non-community engagement (NCE; N =
   69). The CE group reported significantly higher needs satisfaction
   levels with autonomy, competence, and relatedness and greater STEM
   interest and identity. The CE group also expressed that the autonomy
   encouraged them to learn beyond the classroom and helped them engage
   with the community; that they were able to build better products through
   iterations and feedback from users; and that they experienced meaningful
   learning by creating useful products for others. These findings support
   the pedagogical value of community engagement projects to foster
   autonomous motivation. This study explicates how young students' STEM
   interest and identity could be fostered using SDT contextualized as a
   community-based STEM engagement project. Through this study, educators
   worldwide are provided with practical suggestions on using the tested
   approach.},

Abstract = {Teacher noticing, a situation-specific part of teachers' professional
   competence, has gained much importance in the past two decades. The
   construct is believed to play a crucial role in the transfer of
   knowledge and skills into professional teaching performance. However,
   there is little empirical evidence on how the length of teachers'
   teaching experience affects the development of expertise in teacher
   noticing. In particular, little research has been conducted on the
   development of facets of teacher noticing-namely perception,
   interpretation, and decision-making-as well as the handling of cognitive
   demands while applying teacher noticing. To fill this research gap, the
   present study investigates the teacher noticing of master's students,
   early-career teachers, and experienced teachers in the context of
   secondary mathematics via cross-sectional comparison. Teacher noticing
   skills and differences between the three groups are analyzed based on
   participants' ability to deal with the cognitive demands of an
   established video-based teacher noticing instrument. The results suggest
   significant increases in teacher noticing from students to in-service
   teachers, especially in mathematic-specific areas. Hardly any
   significant differences were found between early-career and experienced
   teachers, which suggests a stagnation in teacher noticing skills.
   However, the early-career teachers showed better performance in
   decision-making and mathematics-related items as well as knowledge-based
   items related to recent topics from mathematics pedagogy and general
   pedagogy. This result emphasizes the importance of knowledge
   prerequisites for the development of expertise in teacher noticing. It
   also highlights that expertise development is not directly connected to
   the length of teaching experience.},

Abstract = {Mathematics plays a significant role in many study programs. However,
   several studies show deficiencies and a decline in beginning
   undergraduates' skills in mathematics in many content domains. However,
   it remains unclear whether they have improved in so-called process
   competencies like modeling, mathematical reasoning, or using different
   representations instead, because there has been a shift towards the
   acquisition of such in many recent curricula. We investigated this issue
   at a university in Germany based on data from a (non-standardized)
   mathematics entry test taken by 3076 economics students divided into
   different cohorts from 2012 to 2019. Using regression analyses, we found
   that, on the one hand, students' ability to carry out symbolic
   calculations decreased. On the other hand, their performance increased
   in some test questions focusing on other process competencies like
   reasoning, mathematizing, or using different representations, which have
   become common tasks at school due to a stronger emphasis on these
   process competencies after a curriculum reform. Our data indicate that
   this reform might have had the desired effect.},

Abstract = {Mathematics growth trajectory plays a significant role to predict future
   outcomes and careers. We examined the existence of different growth
   trajectories in mathematics during the late elementary-school period
   (from Grades 4 to 6) and the relationship between the trajectory group
   classification and later mathematics achievement (Grade 8). Then, this
   study examined the moderating effects of mathematics teachers' teaching
   styles. Two thousand six hundred eighty students participated in a
   5-year longitudinal study in South Korea. Growth mixture modeling
   provided four distinctive classes of growth trajectories in elementary
   mathematics achievement, and all classes significantly predicted later
   achievement in Grade 8. Furthermore, the student's perception of
   teaching styles revealed different associations with mathematics
   achievement depending on growth trajectory groups. While direct teaching
   is positively associated with the high and the average performing
   groups, dialogic teaching is positively associated with the low
   performing group. The findings highlighted the growth trajectory is a
   critical component in predicting later academic achievement and students
   need appropriate instructional supports.},

Abstract = {Cosmology concepts encompass complex spatial and temporal relations that
   are counterintuitive. Cosmology findings, because of their intrinsic
   interest, are often reported in the public domain with enthusiasm, and
   students come to cosmology with a range of conceptions some aligned and
   some at variance with the current science. This makes cosmology concepts
   challenging to teach, and also challenging to evaluate students'
   conceptual understanding. This study builds on previous research of the
   authors investigating the methodological challenges for characterising
   students' cosmology conceptions and the reasoning underlying these.
   Insights from student responses in two iterations of an open-ended
   instrument were used to develop a concept inventory that combined
   cosmological conceptions with reasoning levels based on the SOLO
   taxonomy. This paper reports on the development and validation of the
   Cosmology Concept Inventory (CosmoCI) for high school. CosmoCI is a
   28-item multiple-choice instrument that was implemented with grade 10
   and 11 school students (n = 234) in Australia and Sweden. Using Rasch
   analysis in the form of a partial credit model (PCM), the paper
   describes a validated progression in student reasoning in cosmology
   across four conceptual dimensions, supporting the utility of CosmoCI as
   an assessment tool which can also instigate rich discussions in the
   science classroom.},

Abstract = {The discussion of social responsibility has expanded from ethical
   conduct of research to include a broader range of topics including
   participating in the policy-making process, engaging in public discourse
   related to science, and promoting projects serving societal common
   goods. Although such an expanded framework on social responsibility is
   increasingly popular, existing scales on social responsibilities are
   limited. The current study developed and validated a scale for measuring
   the ``Views of Social Responsibility of Scientists and Engineers{''}
   (VSRoSE). The draft scale with 60 items, which were scrutinized through
   expert deliberation, was administered to 327 college students majoring
   in STEM fields. Exploratory factor analysis supported an eight-factor
   solution with 30 items, with acceptable Cronbach's alphas for all eight
   scales. Subsequently, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with an
   independent set of data from 279 college students and the hypothesized
   factor structure fit the data with acceptable Cronbach's alphas. The
   concurrent and criterion validity evidence was presented and the
   pedagogical implications of the VSRoSE in the STEM field and education
   were discussed.},

Title = {Introducing Statistical Inference: Design of a Theoretically and

Abstract = {This paper comprises the results of a design study that aims at
   developing a theoretically and empirically based learning trajectory on
   statistical inference for 9th-grade students. Based on theories of
   informal statistical inference, an 8-step learning trajectory was
   designed. The trajectory consisted of two similar four step sequences:
   (1) experimenting with a physical black box, (2) visualizing
   distributions, (3) examining sampling distributions using simulation
   software, and (4) interpreting sampling distributions to make inferences
   in real -life contexts. Sequence I included only categorical data and
   Sequence II regarded numerical data. The learning trajectory was
   implemented in an intervention among 267 students. To examine the
   effects of the trajectory on students' understanding of statistical
   inference, we analyzed their posttest results after the intervention. To
   investigate how the stepwise trajectory fostered the learning process,
   students' worksheets during each learning step were analyzed. The
   posttest results showed that students who followed the learning
   trajectory scored significantly higher on statistical inference and on
   concepts related to each step than students of a comparison group (n =
   217) who followed the regular curriculum. Worksheet analysis
   demonstrated that the 8-step trajectory was beneficial to students'
   learning processes. We conclude that ideas of repeated sampling with a
   black box and statistical modeling seem fruitful for introducing
   statistical inference. Both ideas invite more advanced follow-up
   activities, such as hypothesis testing and comparing groups. This
   suggests that statistics curricula with a descriptive focus can be
   transformed to a more inferential focus, to anticipate on subsequent
   steps in students' statistics education.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop and validate an instrument for
   measuring Chinese Chemistry Teachers' Perceived Self-Efficacy towards
   Chemistry Core Competencies. Based on the notion of the 2017 Senior High
   School Chemistry Curriculum Standards, the initial instrument consisted
   of 20 items in five CCCs as the distinct constructs were developed. An
   expert panel conducted content and face validity during the
   developmental phase. During the measurement phase, data were collected
   and analyzed from 210 chemistry teachers, including pre-service and
   in-service teachers at a university-government-school (UGS) initiative,
   to provide the construct validity of the initial instrument. Item
   analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis
   were employed to confirm the convergent and discriminant validity and
   reliability of the final instrument with 15 items evenly allocating in
   the five CCCs (macroscopic identification and microscopic analysis,
   changes and equilibrium, evidence-based reasoning and modeling,
   scientific inquiry and innovation, and scientific attitudes and social
   responsibility). Concurrent validity was further provided for the
   instrument by examining the mean differences among teacher demographic
   groups. The result showed that teachers' self-efficacy varied with
   professional stages, years of teaching experiences, and school district
   types, but not with gender. This study provides a thorough process of
   developing and validating an instrument for teacher self-efficacy in a
   specific subject domain. The valid and reliable instrument could benefit
   global teacher education researchers and teacher professional learning
   programs.},

Abstract = {Teaching in ways responsive to the cultures of our students is vital
   towards enhancing equity of access to mathematics achievement and
   putting educational policy into practice. New Zealand has the largest
   group of Pasifika people in the Western world, a multi-ethnic group of
   indigenous people from Pacific Island nations who have differing
   cultural values and experiences than the dominant Pakeha (Maori term
   commonly used to refer to European New Zealanders) population. This
   study aims to explore how patterning tasks based on indigenous patterns
   can support young diverse students to develop understanding of growing
   patterns. Two case studies are presented which show the results of an
   exploratory teaching experiment undertaken with one classroom of
   culturally diverse Year 2 students (6-year-olds) situated in an urban
   low socio-economic area. Data drawn for this paper includes
   video-recorded classroom observations, written responses from students,
   and reflective notes from the researcher and teacher from two lessons of
   a series of 10 lessons on growing patterns. Data analysis involved an
   iterative approach of repeated refinement cycles focusing on early
   algebraic thinking and the pedagogical actions of the teacher. Findings
   revealed that the use of indigenous patterns in conjunction with
   pedagogical actions drawing on cultural values was successful in
   engaging these students in early algebraic reasoning.},

Abstract = {Using data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science
   Study (TIMSS) 2015 assessment of fourth-grade students in 32 countries,
   a series of mean comparisons and regression analyses were conducted to
   determine (1) the gender gap in students' self-concept in mathematics;
   (2) to what extent student achievement, student gender, and parental
   characteristics (early numeracy activities, attitudes, expectations, and
   education) are related to students' self-concept; and (3) to what extent
   the effect of achievement and parental characteristics on mathematics
   self-concept differs between male and female students. Results from this
   study indicate that gender differences in students' self-concept in
   mathematics are significant in most countries, usually in favour of boys
   as early as in fourth grade. The differences largely remain the same
   when the data analysis controls for effects of student achievement and
   parental involvement.},

Title = {Towards a Materialist Vision of `Learning as Making': the Case of 3D
   Printing Pens in School Mathematics},

Abstract = {In this paper, we build on a previously developed notion of `learning as
   Making' to examine mathematics thinking and learning in a highly
   transformative and technological Making environment: one that involves a
   handheld 3D printing technology which enables 3D models to be created
   instantly via one's moving hand. In particular, we present two examples
   of Maker-centred lessons for teaching and learning of primary
   mathematics. In these lessons, the students actively constructed
   artefacts with 3D Printing Pens while engaging in inquiry-based learning
   activities, where the target concepts were properties of prisms and
   cross-sections at the primary 5 (age 10-11) and primary 6 (age 11-12)
   levels respectively. We use diffractive analysis to capture the fine
   details in students' body-material interactions while engaging in the
   tasks with or without the 3D Printing Pens during the lessons. Through
   the lens of Making as a material act of creation and seeking to update
   Papert's constructionist view of learning, we propose to rethink Making
   in school mathematics according to a four-fold characterisation: Making
   is co-constructing meanings, Making is mathematising, Making is
   assembling with technology and Making is inventing. We discuss our
   contribution towards advancing a materialist perspective of learning
   mathematics and implications for a `learning as Making' pedagogy and
   curriculum.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a reflection on the importance of replication
   studies in the development of the field of mathematics education. Based
   on a literature review, it explains what replication studies are, and
   why they are important for our field. It also addresses the issue of
   why, despite their apparent importance, replication studies remain
   scarce. Some open discussions about replication studies in mathematics
   education are pointed out, and a couple of issues related to replication
   studies whose empirical exploration could help to advance our research
   field are identified. Additionally, a typology of fundamental questions
   and modes of exploration that could guide a replication study in
   mathematics education is proposed. The paper closes with a discussion
   about the necessary conditions to promote and further develop
   replication studies in mathematics education.},

Title = {On Meaningful, Researchable, and Generative Questions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {SUPPL 1, 1, SI},
Pages = {67-82},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This essay focuses on a particular subset of educational research,
   questions that are researchable and that, ultimately, will make a
   positive difference for the educational enterprise. It argues that to be
   researchable, tasks need to be addressable in operational terms - that
   questions that hinge on values (e.g. ``are large small classes better
   than large classes?{''}) are inherently unaddressable until the values
   undergirding the questions are specified in clear and meaningful ways.
   Key claims of this paper are that in addition to being addressable, to
   advance the field, research questions should be meaningful and
   generative. What is meant by meaningful is that the answer to the
   questions posed should matter to either practice or theory in some
   important way. What is meant by generative is that working on the
   problem, whether it is ``solved{''} or not, is likely to provide
   valuable insights. Interestingly, time is not necessarily an issue - a
   problem that takes a century to solve may still be extremely valuable -
   if the subproblems it spawns are rich, interesting, and addressable.
   From this author's perspective, for a problem to be researchable (in
   effect, answerable) is only a first step. What makes problems valuable
   to the field is their potential importance and their fruitfulness in
   producing ongoing insights and meaningful questions. A range of examples
   including design experiments, assessments, and the evolution of an
   extended research program are discussed as illustrations of the above
   claims.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom (FC) pedagogical frameworks have recently gained
   considerable popularity, especially at secondary school levels. However,
   there are rich opportunities to explore FC at tertiary levels, but
   progress on the area requires instructors' attention to well-designed
   tasks for students' collaborative learning. Realistic Mathematics
   Education (RME) provides a foundation for the development of such tasks.
   This article advances research on the role of task design in a FC
   context by considering how RME heuristics may be developed to include
   the out-of-class phase, where students prepare for in-class work with
   videos. This adaption, named flipped RME classroom design, is explored
   through two realizations of such a design with a group of computer
   engineering students during their first year of studying compulsory
   mathematics. Thematic analysis of the classroom observations shows that
   students' modelling activity in-class is supported by the design of an
   out-of-class component in combination with teacher guidance of students'
   modelling activity.},

Abstract = {This paper describes an empirical study examining action research papers
   submitted by a group (n = 81) of out-of-field mathematics teachers as
   part of a professional development programme in Ireland. Utilising
   document analysis, the papers were qualitatively analysed for evidence
   of teachers' beliefs and practices with respect to the teaching and
   learning of mathematics. In particular, demonstration of direct
   transmission and constructivist beliefs and practices was explored. The
   authors draw on Valsiner's zone theory in conceptualising the
   `teacher-as-learner' in this out-of-field context and it provided a
   means for analysing teachers' development in terms of their beliefs and
   practices. Findings indicate a prevalence of direct transmission or
   traditional teaching practices prior to the out-of-field teachers'
   action research, with some inconsistency with professed constructivist
   beliefs. There was evidence of a majority shift towards constructivist
   beliefs and practices post action research for a myriad of reasons,
   including increased pedagogical confidence in mathematics and the
   successful experience of constructivist approaches. Findings also
   highlight the role of reflective self-study in facilitating the creation
   of productive tensions, as well as the importance of the teachers'
   interpretation of their zone of free movement in resolving complex
   issues and enabling out-of-field teachers' development of constructivist
   beliefs and practices.},

Abstract = {Judging the reasonableness of computational results is pivotal for
   students to understand mathematical concepts. This domain is the most
   sensitive to the presence of misconceptions in mathematics. Confidence
   ratings can serve as a measure of the strength of students' conceptual
   understanding. This study investigated the performance, misconceptions,
   and confidence ratings of 942 Hong Kong sixth grade students when they
   were asked to judge the reasonableness of computational results. The
   results showed that the students performed unsatisfactorily at judging
   the reasonableness, with an average score of 3.45 (out of 8). Slightly
   more than half of the students (53.72\%) selected the correct
   computational results, but more than 60\% of those students could not
   judge the reasonableness of the computational results (49.71\% had
   misconceptions and 11.24\% simply guessed the answers). In addition,
   only 20.82\% and 18.23\% of the students could apply number-sense- and
   rule-based methods to judge the reasonableness, respectively. Moreover,
   only 5.73\% of the students showed high performance with a high
   confidence rating, 3.18\% exhibited low performance with a low
   confidence rating, and 35.46\% of them showed low performance with a
   high confidence rating. Furthermore, this study discusses students'
   misconceptions, the implications of the study, and suggestions for
   future research.},

Abstract = {Research on number sense presents contradictory arguments and results
   regarding the effects of context-based tasks and activities on students'
   number sense. The aim of this study was to examine fourth-grade
   elementary school students' number sense as they solve context-based
   (CB) and non-context-based (NCB) items. A survey design was employed and
   data collected using CB and NCB tests for this purpose. The results
   showed that students were more successful on NCB test compared to the CB
   test. Students performed best on the problems related to the ``using a
   reference point{''} component of number sense, while they performed
   worst on the ``understanding of the number size{''} component. The
   majority of students used rule-based strategies (RBSs) for both CB and
   NCB tests. Interviews with students who solved CB items using RBSs
   showed that students were able to recognize and use number sense-based
   strategies (NSBSs) to some degree when they were asked for alternative
   solution methods. The variability found in students' recognition and use
   of number sense seem to depend on such factors as the lack of number
   sense, preference to RBS, task structure (e.g. involving visual
   representations and easy numbers), and task requirements (e.g. asking
   for estimation or comparison vs. exact answer, requiring additional
   adjustments on reference points).},

Abstract = {This study investigates how elementary students were able to construct a
   human respiratory system model and, in particular, how the process of
   reasoning contributed to their model through the use of analogy model
   activities. For this study, modeling activities that included the use of
   analogy models were designed and implemented. Over 4 class periods in
   which analogy model activities were used, 18 fifth- and sixth-grade
   elementary students were asked to construct a model of the human
   respiratory system, showing the system's structure, function, and
   mechanism. By engaging in activity with a syringe analogy model, several
   elementary students developed their model from a function-centered model
   to a mechanism-centered model, whereas others elaborated their model
   from a mechanism-centered model to an elaborated mechanism-centered
   model via activity with a balloon-lung analogy model. During model
   construction, the analogy model activities played a facilitating role in
   helping students to construct the invisible mechanisms, based on the
   model-based reasoning, and to elaborate their model by considering the
   sub-structures' movement within the system. This study provides
   additional discussions of the ways in which model activities can support
   the students' reasoning in the modeling process.},

Abstract = {Science as a Human Endeavour (SHE) is an innovative strand of the most
   recent Australian Curriculum: Science. The introduction of SHE is
   welcome and comes at a time when Science, Technology, Engineering and
   Mathematics (STEM) education is under increasing scrutiny both in
   Australia and across the world, with some commentators identifying a
   possible crisis. Such an adventurous addition to the curriculum, however
   well-intentioned, was always going to provoke significant challenges to
   the repertoires and pedagogical approaches of many teachers, and
   particularly early career teachers. This project aimed to link three
   important elements of science education: pedagogy related to SHE,
   concepts of critical pedagogy and the professional learning of teachers
   through practitioner inquiry. We document how three early career
   teachers of science, all teaching in low socio-economic schools in
   challenging circumstances, found ways to engage with the demands of the
   Australian Curriculum and redesign pedagogy for incorporating the SHE
   strand into their practice. These early career teachers participated in
   a year-long action research study into the effectiveness of their own
   pedagogical practices. The paper examines the challenge these teachers
   faced as they incorporated SHE into their teaching.},

Abstract = {In understanding upper secondary school students' interpretations of
   information in graphical representations of a distance-time graph and an
   ECG graph, little attention has been paid to the analysis of the
   condition of the conceptual development related to their utterances.
   Understanding this better can help improve the teaching of
   interpretations of information in graphical representations of different
   situations. This paper integrates results from 2 studies and 3
   theoretical perspectives: Tall and Vinner's theoretical perspectives on
   learning, Chi's ontological perspectives on conceptual development and
   Friel's theoretical perspectives on interpretation of graphical
   information. The findings provide evidence to support the conjecture
   that iconic interpretations could be stimulated and generated as a
   result of student categorisation of a distance-time graph as an event,
   when in fact the graph is being used to describe and communicate a
   process. The outcome further indicates that students found a resemblance
   between the ECG diagram and the periodic function of f(x) = sin(x).},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of the science writing heuristic
   (SWH) approach on the quality of prospective science teachers' (PSTs)
   argumentative writing and their understanding of the components of
   argumentation in the SWH approach and their own learning. Ten SWH
   approach activities were implemented during the semester. The study was
   carried out with 31 PSTs. A case study design was used. Data included
   the SWH approach's grading rubric and semistructured interviews. While
   the ANOVA and Bonferroni tests were used to analyze the SWH approach's
   grading rubric, content analysis was used to analyze the semistructured
   interviews conducted with 12 PSTs. The ANOVA results showed a
   statistical difference among the writing performance of the PSTs (F =
   14.493, p < 0.01). The findings gathered from the interviews revealed
   that the quality of the argumentative writing and research skills of the
   PSTs increased over time. The PSTs made explicit associations among
   their beginning questions, data and observations, and claims and
   evidence, and they made distinctions between their data, observations,
   and evidence. Multiple representations played an important role in
   providing evidence to support claims. Moreover, the process of
   negotiation helped PSTs learn more effectively, and they believed that
   the argument-based inquiry lab was beneficial to their learning and
   their future vocational careers as teachers.},

Abstract = {This study is a detailed look at the level of understanding of
   fundamental ideas about blackbody radiation (BBR) among physics
   teachers. The aim is to explore associations and ideas that teachers
   have regarding blackbody radiation: a concept used routinely in physics
   and chemistry, which is necessary to understand fundamentals of quantum
   physics. In this explorative study, the responses of 106 high school
   physics teachers from 18 different cities in Turkey were examined using
   an online questionnaire during the 2014/2015 academic year. Male (88 \%)
   and female (12 \%) teachers with an average teaching experience of 17
   years participated in this study. Teachers were asked about the concept
   of a ``blackbody{''} and its radiation as well as about the closely
   related topics such as Wien's law and the historic effect of
   understanding BBR on the development of modern physics. In this study,
   teachers' spontaneous ideas about the BBR are depicted by ``answer
   sculptures.{''} The answer sculpture is a new way of representing and
   categorizing responses provided by the participants. The analysis of
   answer sculptures revealed that the physics teachers' factual knowledge
   and their conceptual understanding of the BBR are incomplete and even
   misleading. Here is what teachers we surveyed make of BBR as presented
   in our answer sculptures. This study is left at investigating teachers'
   understandings of (1) blackbody radiation and (2) the significance of
   this scientific breakthrough.},

Abstract = {Australia currently faces a skill shortage in Science, Technology,
   Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) professions unlikely to improve if
   the current trend of low enrolments in high-level mathematics in
   secondary school continues. Many factors seem to contribute to this
   trend, and amongst them, research recognises student attitudes towards
   mathematics and careers in STEM. Research also shows that teachers and
   classroom practices are key agents to change these attitudes. This paper
   examines teachers' perceptions of students' attitudes towards
   mathematics and careers in STEM, as well as classroom practices
   emanating from those perceptions. Combining data from two studies, a
   large-scale survey and an intervention, we argue three main points: (1)
   student attitudes and teachers' perceptions of those attitudes quite
   clearly differ, (2) targeted interventions showing links between
   mathematics and careers in STEM can have an influence on students'
   perceptions of STEM careers and (3) an implementation of classroom
   ability grouping based on standardised test scores can be
   disadvantageous to students who have a natural inclination towards STEM
   and positive attitudes towards mathematics.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present the results of a research study that
   explores secondary students' capacity to perform translations of
   algebraic statements between the verbal and symbolic representation
   systems through the lens of errors. We classify and compare the errors
   made by 2 groups of students: 1 at the beginning of their studies in
   school algebra and another 1 completing their studies on algebra in
   compulsory education. This comparison allows us to detect errors which
   require specific attention in instruction due to its persistence and to
   identify errors that disappear as students advance in their study of
   algebra. The results and conclusions have a pedagogic value to inform
   instruction and also lead to backed conjectures and research questions
   to push forward research on student's translation capacity and students'
   knowledge of algebraic symbolism.},

Abstract = {Explaining appears to dominate primary teachers' understanding of
   mathematical reasoning when it is not confused with problem solving.
   Drawing on previous literature of mathematical reasoning, we generate a
   view of the critical aspects of reasoning that may assist primary
   teachers when designing and enacting tasks to elicit and develop
   mathematical reasoning. The task used in this study of children's
   reasoning is a number commonality problem. We analysed written and
   verbal samples of reasoning gathered from children in grades 3 and 4
   from three primary schools in Australia and one elementary school in
   Canada to map the variation in their reasoning. We found that comparing
   and contrasting was a critical aspect of forming conjectures when
   generalising in this context, an action not specified in frameworks for
   generalising in early algebra. The variance in children's reasoning
   elicited through this task also illuminated the difference between
   explaining and justifying.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on exploring students' understanding of the concept
   of function concerning three main aspects: secondary students' ability
   to (1) define the concept of function and present examples of functions,
   (2) solve tasks which asked them to recognize and interpret the concept
   of function presented in different forms of representation, and (3)
   solve function problems. Confirmatory factor analysis verified 4
   dimensions comprising the conceptual understanding of functions:
   definition, recognition, interpretation, and problem solving.
   Furthermore, the important role of the ability to define the concept on
   the rest abilities was revealed, leading to important didactic
   implications.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing demand from employers and universities for school
   leavers to be able to apply their mathematical knowledge to problem
   solving in varied and unfamiliar contexts. These aspects are however
   neglected in most examinations of mathematics and, consequentially, in
   classroom teaching. One barrier to the inclusion of mathematical problem
   solving in assessment is that the skills involved are difficult to
   define and assess objectively. We present two studies that test a method
   called comparative judgement (CJ) that might be well suited to assessing
   mathematical problem solving. CJ is an alternative to traditional
   scoring that is based on collective expert judgements of students' work
   rather than item-by-item scoring schemes. In study 1, we used CJ to
   assess traditional mathematics tests and found it performed validly and
   reliably. In study 2, we used CJ to assess mathematical problem-solving
   tasks and again found it performed validly and reliably. We discuss the
   implications of the results for further research and the implications of
   CJ for the design of mathematical problem-solving tasks.},

Abstract = {Nearly all primate species are globally threatened. Conservation
   approaches need to focus on local people and users of resources from the
   habitats of the apes. Students worldwide should become aware of the
   context and relationships in school, and they should change their usage
   and behaviour as the ultimate goals. This study explored the
   understanding and motivation of adolescents in German secondary schools
   (grades 5 and 6) introduced to out-of-school lessons in a zoo education
   program in comparison to a school-based program or no instruction. We
   developed 2 educational programs to raise awareness and concern for the
   conservation of primates: one was carried out in the local zoo; the
   other at workstations in public schools. Students (N = 1,013)
   participated in the study based on a 2 x 2 factorial design-instruction
   and place. Students from the zoo education program demonstrated higher
   content and affective achievement than students from the school-based
   and control programs; a combination of both programs did not lead to
   higher scores in the tests after the program. Learning in zoo school had
   a sustained influence on retention. Interest was higher in the zoo-based
   programs while perceived choice was higher in the school-based program.},

Title = {CALCULUS STUDENTS' AND INSTRUCTORS' CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF SLOPE: A
   COMPARISON ACROSS ACADEMIC LEVELS},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {This study considers tertiary calculus students' and instructors'
   conceptualizations of slope. Qualitative techniques were employed to
   classify responses to 5 items using conceptualizations of slope
   identified across various research settings. Students' responses suggest
   that they rely on procedurally based conceptualizations of slope,
   showing little evidence of covariational reasoning. In contrast,
   instructors' responses demonstrated a multi-dimensional understanding of
   slope as a functional property, which applies to real-world situations
   and plays an integral role in the development of key calculus concepts.
   While relatively diverse, the instructors' responses seldom reported
   determining increasing or decreasing trends of a line from its slope.
   This conceptualization was used frequently by students and could help
   them better understand how slope ties to positive and negative
   derivatives. The most frequently used conceptualizations for students in
   this study align with past research findings on the emphasis of the
   secondary mathematics curriculum, supporting the possibility of cultural
   influences (academic and geographic) on individuals' conceptualizations
   of slope. Thus, this study provides valuable insight into
   conceptualizations of slope and provides direction for future research
   on slope and the broader topic of cultural influences on mathematical
   meaning.},

Abstract = {This quantitative case study used a pre- and posttest design for
   exploring the gender differences in secondary school students' (n = 131,
   45 males and 86 females) learning of the force concept when an
   interactive engagement type of teaching was used. In addition, students'
   ability to interpret multiple representations (i.e., representational
   consistency) was documented by a pre- and posttest and scientific
   reasoning ability by a pretest only. Males significantly outperformed
   females in learning of the force concept, pre- and posttest
   representational consistency, and pretest scientific reasoning. However,
   the gender difference in learning of the force concept was not
   significant when ANCOVA was conducted using pretest results of
   representational consistency and scientific reasoning as covariates.
   This appeared to indicate that the gender difference in learning gain
   was related to students' abilities before the instruction. Thus, the
   teaching method used was equally effective for both genders. Further,
   our quantitative finding about the relation between representational
   consistency and learning of the force concept supports the assumption
   that multiple representations are important in science learning.},

Abstract = {The most recent Program for International Student Assessment (PISA)
   (2009) mathematical literacy results provide evidence that in Western
   English-speaking countries, including Australia, the gender gap in
   achievement appears to be widening in favour of males. In the study
   reported in this article, the aim was to explore the effects of gender,
   school type (a measure of socioeconomic background), school learning
   setting and geographic location on mathematics performance amongst the
   highest achievers (top 2 \%) in the grade 12 Victorian Certificate of
   Education (VCE) mathematics subjects based on results reported in a
   metropolitan newspaper. The analyses revealed that over the period
   2007-2009, males, students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds and
   those attending metropolitan schools predominated amongst the highest
   achievers in all three VCE mathematics subjects. Students in single-sex
   settings, particularly males, were also over-represented. For each
   factor, the dominance was more pronounced as the level of difficulty of
   the mathematics subject increased.},

Abstract = {This study provides a snapshot of elementary school teachers'
   understanding of the mean and median. The research is presented in light
   of recent work regarding preservice teachers' understanding of the mean.
   Common misconceptions are identified which lead to potential
   implications for teacher preparation programs. One of the primary
   concerns regarding increasing the standards expected of students to
   learn statistics is teachers' preparation to address those standards.
   Exploring issues with teachers' understanding of two of the most
   prominent concepts in the enacted curriculum provides a glimpse into the
   need to adequately prepare teachers to teach statistics.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which three
   teachers' professional experience and existing orientations toward
   teaching and learning mathematics and science influenced their
   implementation of a project-based curriculum (i.e. project-based
   learning (PBL)). Data sources included interviews, videotapes of
   classroom activity, and a teaching philosophy questionnaire. Data
   analysis was conducted using an iterative coding technique. We found
   coherency between the teachers' perceived orientations and their
   emergent ideas about PBL, their sense of PBL as being compatible with
   their goals, and the specific challenges with which they struggled. All
   the teachers wanted their students to be successful; however, different
   definitions of success led to quite different approaches toward
   teaching, and for the most part, these differences appeared to have
   occurred because of existing orientations the teachers held for teaching
   their discipline. Implications for professional development taking into
   account teachers' orientations and thus their professional experience
   are discussed, as well as disciplinary challenges to using PBL.},

Abstract = {The aims of the study were to investigate (a) the relationship between
   the attitudes toward biology and perceptions of the biology learning
   environment among grade 11 students in Tulkarm District, Palestine and
   (b) the effect of gender and residence of these students on their
   attitudes toward biology and on their perceptions of the biology
   learning environment. The study used a 30-item Attitudes Toward Biology
   Questionnaire and a 32-item Learning Environment Questionnaire. The
   association between attitudes toward biology and the biology learning
   environment were significant, with a correlation coefficient of 0.366.
   The results of the study indicated that there were significant gender
   differences in attitudes toward biology and in perceptions of the
   learning environment, favoring females; however, there were no
   significant residence differences in attitudes toward biology and in
   perceptions of the learning environment.},

Abstract = {This mixed-method research attempted to clarify the role of visuospatial
   abilities in learning about mineralogy. Various sources of
   data-including quantitative pre- and postmeasures of spatial
   visualization and spatial orientation tests and achievement scores on
   six measures and qualitative unstructured observations, interviews, and
   field trip notes-were utilized to document the abilities and learning of
   27 university students. Results indicated that (a) some students had
   initial difficulty with certain visual concepts, such as 3D crystal
   models, symmetry elements, mirror symmetry, rotation, inversion, and
   combination of symmetry elements while they were learning about
   mineralogy; (b) learning about mineralogy and spatial ability are two
   interrelated components; while the mineralogy course improved students'
   spatial ability, their existing spatial abilities had a strong influence
   on facilitating mineralogy learning; and (c) spatial visualization skill
   is a better predictor of mineralogy achievement than spatial orientation
   skill. While the discussions highlighted the role of visuospatial
   thinking in learning about mineralogy, it is argued that researchers and
   curriculum developers should focus on the productive role of
   visuospatial thinking in learning about science.},

Abstract = {The issue of mathematics underachievement among students has been an
   increasing international concern over the last few decades. Research
   suggests that academic success can be achieved by focusing on both the
   individual and social aspects of learning. Within the area of
   mathematics education, the development of metacognitive skills and the
   incorporation of discourse in classroom instruction has resulted in
   students having deeper conceptual understandings of the content and
   increased mathematical achievement. However, studies in this field tend
   to focus on the effects of these practices separately, making research
   that seeks to harness the potential of both quite rare. This paper
   reports on a study that was aimed at addressing this gap in the
   literature by examining the effects of writing and argumentation on
   achievement. Two hundred and eleven students and five teachers
   participated in this multimethod study that investigated the effects of
   three treatment conditions on mathematical achievement. These conditions
   were writing alone, argumentation alone, and writing and argumentation
   combined. Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences
   between the groups, and tests of the contrasts showed that students who
   engaged in both argumentation and writing had greater knowledge gains
   than students who engaged in argumentation alone or neither activity.},

Title = {School Stratification and Science Climate in Early Secondary Education
   in Ireland and Flanders: Associations with Students' Science
   Dispositions and Science Literacy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 30},
Abstract = {Adaptive science dispositions (epistemology, enjoyment, interest, and
   self-efficacy) have been shown to be related to schools' science climate
   and science literacy. School stratification may promote positive
   linkages among science dispositions, science literacy, and science
   climate. To examine the association between school stratification and
   such linkages, we undertook a comparative study of early secondary
   schools in Ireland (less stratified-modest tracking, modest grade
   retention) and Flanders (Dutch-speaking Belgian region; more
   stratified-multiple tracks, extensive grade retention). Using Program
   for International Student Assessment (PISA 2015) data and multilevel
   modeling methods, we included 5419 (Ireland) and 5675 (Flanders)
   students nested within 157 and 171 schools, respectively. Student- and
   school-level variables with potential associations with our outcome
   measures (science dispositions for the first research question (RQ1);
   science literacy for RQ2) were included in baseline models. Subsequent
   models estimated ``over-and-above{''} associations of science climate
   with science dispositions (RQ1) and of both science dispositions and
   climate with science literacy (RQ2). Science dispositions, as outcomes,
   were associated with disciplinary climate and teaching support in
   science classroom, particularly in Ireland. All four science
   dispositions (as independent variables) were associated with science
   literacy (both separately and in concert) for both Irish and Flemish
   cases. Epistemology was most strongly associated with science literacy.
   A less stratified school system may grant teachers more opportunities to
   craft positive science learning environments. A more stratified school
   system may amplify existing divergences in science (dispositions and
   literacy).},

Abstract = {In this study, 271 pre- and in-service science teachers in Israel were
   surveyed on their level of awareness about green chemistry and
   sustainability, as well as attitudes toward environmental education. Of
   the total participants, 123 were in-service science teachers with
   different seniority levels teaching in elementary, middle, and high
   schools. The remaining participants were teacher candidates studying at
   different institutions. The main source of the data was derived from a
   34-item questionnaire that assessed teachers' awareness of green
   chemistry and sustainability and attitudes toward environmental
   education. The findings illustrated that the teachers' sustainability
   and green chemistry awareness was low in general, although their views
   on environmental education were mostly positive. In-service science
   teachers were found to have more knowledge about green chemistry and
   sustainability than pre-service science teachers. Notably, in-service
   science teachers with more than 10 years of teaching experience were
   found to have more knowledge than those who have less experience.
   Teaching implications and possible future studies were presented as
   well.},

Abstract = {We present evidence of a secondary school teacher's Knowledge of
   Mathematics Teaching when she teaches linear equations in a word problem
   setting. We focus on analyzing the examples and mathematics support that
   she provides her students with during two classes. When faced with
   contingencies, she takes decisions whereby she adapts or creates
   emerging action plans in order to enrich and help her students overcome
   their difficulties to learn linear equations. The decisions and actions
   observed during the classroom practices demonstrated that providing
   support and examples for her students and accomplishing the lesson
   goals-mediated by her teaching knowledge-were at odds with each other.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to describe and characterize the insights of
   elementary school students during the collaborative solving of
   mathematics problems. A total of 10 elementary school 60-min math
   classes were analyzed, with each session documented by videotaping the
   interaction of groups of 3 to 6 children. The study included 41 students
   in total (14 boys and 27 girls aged from 7 to 10). Group interaction was
   analyzed by taking spontaneous insights as queues. The results
   distinguish full insight-where students suddenly discover the answer to
   the problem-from partial insight-where students realize they have been
   following an incorrect procedure. Data shows that most insight takes
   place during interaction and not individually. An in-depth description
   of such insights shows a junction between the semantic content in verbal
   explanations and proto-symbolic content involved in gestures. The
   described insights also show in situ emergence of joint rhythmicity
   among participants. Results suggest that it is possible to clearly
   identify insight in spontaneous interaction among school children.},

Abstract = {One of the most important problems of today's science education is the
   misconceptions and lack of knowledge that arise due to the science
   concepts not being learned in depth and meaningfully. For this reason,
   in this study, misconceptions, lack of knowledge, and scientific
   knowledge levels of science teachers about liquid pressure, which is one
   of the most challenging issues for students, were aimed to reveal using
   a four-tier misconception diagnostic test. For this purpose, the KR-20
   reliability coefficient of the four-tier misconception diagnostic test
   developed for liquid pressure was calculated as 0.805 according to the
   scientific knowledge score, and the KR-20 reliability coefficient
   according to the misconception score was calculated as 0.755. The
   research data were collected from 481 science teacher candidates
   studying at six different universities in Turkey. Through the developed
   misconception test, 24 different misconceptions were revealed, and it
   was determined that 9 of them existed in 10\% or more of science teacher
   candidates. Research results showed that science teacher candidates'
   scientific knowledge about liquid pressure was about 15\%, lack of
   scientific knowledge was about 35\%, and misconceptions were about 35\%.
   In the light of this information, it can be suggested to the researchers
   who want to make descriptive studies that this study, which is carried
   out on science teacher candidates, can be applied to middle and high
   school students. Researchers who want to conduct experimental studies
   may be advised to design experimental studies to overcome the
   misconceptions that arose in this study.},

Abstract = {Fractions are an important mathematical concept for elementary students.
   However, students with mathematics learning disabilities (MLD) struggle
   with learning fractions. Research has demonstrated that
   concrete-representational-abstract (CRA) instruction is an effective
   practice for students with learning and developmental disabilities. Here
   we investigated whether CRA instruction can support struggling learners'
   understanding of fractions in China. Using a multiple probe
   across-students single-case design, we applied CRA instructions to 4
   fourth-grade students with MLD. Results showed that CRA instruction
   improved students' fraction proficiency. Limitations of the study, as
   well as implications on CRA instruction for elementary students with MLD
   in practice, are discussed.},

Abstract = {The role of engineering in science and mathematics education continues
   to emerge as a contributing factor to improving STEM education. Efforts
   across different countries include the integration of engineering in
   K-12 curriculum, after school programs, and inservice teacher
   professional development. Only recently have science teacher educators
   begun to introduce engineering in science teacher preparation programs.
   By incorporating novel curriculum and design-related experiences, we can
   begin to explore how preservice teachers not only learn about
   engineering, but more importantly, learn how to teach science using
   engineering design. In this study, we explore different ways 45
   elementary preservice science teachers characterize and construct new
   understandings about engineering design-based science teaching. Data
   were gathered via self-interviews and reflective narratives. Data
   analysis entailed systematic and consistent open coding across
   transcripts. Document analysis served as a means of triangulation,
   reinforcing and reaffirming claims corroborated through the analysis of
   interview data. Using the teacher as learner framework, we contend that
   preservice teachers, when engaged in an engineering design-based methods
   course, demonstrate positive shifts from being learners to teachers of
   science by embodying the participatory, performative, and experiential
   nature of engineering design. To support preservice teacher development,
   we propose that teacher education programs incorporate engineering
   design-based learning experiences throughout teacher preparation rather
   than in a single semester or year. This means integrating more and
   earlier opportunities for preservice teachers to develop and apply their
   understandings of engineering design and design teaching, potentially
   leading to earlier shifts and increased design-based pedagogical
   understandings.},

Abstract = {In this article, we describe a case study that was conducted within a
   study aiming to diagnose grade 5 students' concept images of
   parallelograms. The theoretical framework that we adopted for this study
   was that of concept definition-concept image as reported by Tall and
   Vinner (Educational Studies in Mathematics 12:151-169, 1981), a theory
   that is widely used in mathematics education. The occurrences during our
   interviews with one of the first students that we interviewed led us to
   identify a need to extend this theory. This manuscript suggests to add
   two new constructs to the theory of concept definition-concept image:
   missing concept images and mis-in concept images. Missing concept image
   defines a situation in which an example of a concept is erroneously
   categorized as a non-example of the concept. Mis-in concept image is the
   somewhat complementary case, in which a non-example of the concept is
   mis(takenly) in(cluded) in the set of examples of the concept and
   consequently this non-example is erroneously identified as an example of
   the concept. In this manuscript, we introduce these two constructs. We
   also describe two possible sources of students' decisions regarding
   their ways of sorting figures into examples and non-examples of
   parallelograms that were detected during the interviews. To the best of
   our knowledge, these sources were not reported in the related
   literature.},

Abstract = {We report on a teacher development program aimed at improving
   mathematics teaching and learning from grades 5-9. The 18-month largely
   online program arose from a partnership of mathematics education
   researchers, mathematicians, physicists, and nine school districts. The
   program employed functions as a lens to reinterpret and interconnect
   content topics in the mathematics curriculum. It was designed to promote
   a deep understanding of mathematics while drawing upon students'
   spontaneous reasoning, generalizations, representations, and discussions
   about relations between physical quantities and numbers. We describe the
   program's foundations and activities and analyze changes in teaching and
   in student learning during 3 years of implementation. Results suggest
   that the teacher development program contributed to improved teaching in
   the target districts and to positive changes in the performance of
   target district students on state-mandated tests.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the professional developments of
   science teacher candidates over 14 weeks of microteaching practices. The
   sample for the study was comprised of 9 teacher candidates aged 21-23
   who were studying their final year (4th year) in an elementary science
   education undergraduate programme of an education faculty in the western
   part of Turkey. The teaching practice course in which all the
   participants were enrolled is an 8-hour-required course. A 2-hour face
   to face theoretical part of this course is conducted at the university,
   and a 6-hour application part is conducted in a real school environment.
   In the study, nine preservice teachers taught three science topics at
   their practice schools, supported by the theoretical knowledge provided
   to them by academic staff. Data were collected using theTeachers'
   Development Scale. It was assumed that the obtained data reflected the
   level of the professional development with respect to pedagogical,
   pedagogical content and content knowledge competences of the preservice
   teachers. Quantitative approaches were utilised in the data analysis. As
   a result, it was found that the competence scores of all the preservice
   teachers increased with the microteaching applications. Also, competence
   scores showed statistically significant differences over the practice
   sessions with respect to the academic achievement levels of the
   preservice teachers.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a qualitative study developed with a group of
   16-year-old students who were asked to estimate large numbers of
   elements on a bounded surface. Taking the realistic mathematics
   education framework as a reference, we presented the students with an
   activity sequence comprised of four different tasks-each one with a
   different realistic context, which were variations of the same
   estimation problem. Our data comprises the written reports that the
   students submitted on completing the tasks. The strategies deployed by
   the students to solve the tasks consisted in the incardination of
   procedures related to the concepts of measurement and proportionality.
   For each task, we present the characterization of the strategies through
   a visual resource in the form of a tree-like diagram. We integrated the
   treelike diagrams of the four tasks to generate a tree-like diagram for
   the general problem. This allowed us to discuss the role of context in
   the strategies the students reported having used.},

Abstract = {Studies in science education have explored contextual features that
   facilitate students' active participation in discussion in argumentation
   activities. Based on this literature, we aimed to explore students'
   practices as they shifted their epistemic practices from unproductive to
   collaborative meaning-making discussion in an argumentation activity in
   a science classroom. We examined the discursive interactions of a small
   group with students who attempted to engage in interaction with one
   another, facilitating the negotiation of group members' positional
   framings as collaborative contributors during an argumentation activity.
   Although the students suggested ideas and engaged in interactions, the
   students' interactions were first dependent on a student holding higher
   epistemic authority (a polarized collective zone of interaction). The
   students' shift to collaborative contributors was shown in separate
   zones of interaction from a student with higher epistemic authority, led
   by a student who repeatedly attempted to elicit other students'
   reasoning. Then, at the end of the activity, this zone of collaborative
   contributors expanded to all of the group members, and the students
   jointly developed the reasoning (a collective zone of interaction). This
   finding indicates the importance of facilitating students in recognizing
   not only themselves but also one another as also potential contributors.
   With such acknowledgment, the students can elicit one another's ideas,
   facilitating them in positioning themselves as collaborative
   contributors in argumentation activities. We discuss the meaning of
   being collaborative contributors and the significance of students' role
   in shifting their positional framing.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the nature of pre-service science teachers'
   (PSTs') situation-specific skills for informal formative assessment (FA)
   and their awareness of activating these skills in classroom-like
   situations. Video-based interviews were conducted to collect data from
   fifteen PSTs before they participated in a teacher education program.
   Authentic classroom videos capturing evidence of student thinking were
   used as probes to elicit information on the PSTs' perceptions,
   interpretations, and decision-making in various classroom-like
   situations that afforded opportunities for FA. The findings indicate
   that the PSTs tended to focus on content-generic evidence and the
   responses of students in the whole class, to infer student thinking at a
   non-content specific level, and to propose responses that were vague or
   devoid of scientific content. On re-exposure to the same evidence of
   student thinking captured in short video clips, and with more specific
   prompting questions, more of the PSTs identified content-specific
   evidence from individual students and interpreted the nuances of student
   thinking at a content-specific level. Yet, the capacity of the PSTs to
   propose student-focused instructional moves remained limited. Overall,
   the findings suggest that the PSTs were not particularly aware of
   applying their situation-specific skills for informal FA when making
   on-the-fly teaching decisions in classroom-like situations that offer
   rich opportunities for FA. This study adds to the existing understanding
   of PST knowledge/skills for informal FA and provides a mechanism for
   eliciting and characterizing teachers' situation-specific skills for
   informal FA. The implications for initial teacher education are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Learning science encompasses learning the language of science, which can
   pose considerable challenges to students due to its specialized features
   and structures. Addressing the three-language problem (the need to
   transition between daily, general school and disciplinary languages) and
   the specific language demands of science thus constitutes part of the
   larger goal of promoting disciplinary literacy. Most studies have
   focused on the conceptual demands of science learning and have not
   examined what knowledge teachers require to support students' learning
   of the language of science. In this study, we focus on science teachers'
   knowledge of students (KS) for addressing the language demands of
   science. This qualitative case study has two aims: (1) to unpack a
   teacher's KS related to their language use in science and (2) to uncover
   how this KS informs teaching practices. Transcripts of teacher
   interviews, lesson planning sessions and lessons drawn from two Grade 4
   science classrooms taught by a primary science teacher constituted the
   data for this study. We identify five aspects of KS (i.e. prior
   knowledge of and about language, difficulties with language, abilities
   across modes of language and across subject areas and learning progress)
   that inform four distinct teaching practices. This case study highlights
   and unpacks a dimension of KS that is often overlooked in the current
   literature on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for science teaching.
   The implications to teachers' PCK, science teaching and teacher
   professional development are discussed in light of the findings.},

Abstract = {Chemistry, with its related technical applications, is of crucial
   importance for creating a sustainable future. Without chemistry, current
   challenges will be difficult to solve. Such problems include meeting
   most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced by the United
   Nations and adherence to planetary limits, for example, novel chemical
   substances being released to the environment, biochemical flows, and
   climate change. Such challenges can, however, only be solved via
   transdisciplinary approaches. They can never be fully explored by a
   single discipline only, either in reality or in the context of teaching
   and learning. In order to strengthen education for sustainable
   development (ESD), we suggest including geographical perspectives in
   science education. Geography commits itself to the analysis of
   human-environment systems and combines social perspectives with those
   found in the natural sciences. In our opinion, such an approach can
   increase the educational value of science learning, e.g. in the case of
   chemistry education. An exploratory interview study with twelve
   purposefully selected chemistry teachers was recently conducted in order
   to explore chemistry teachers' views on implementing geographical
   perspectives. This study reveals that German chemistry teachers view
   such inclusion as generally positive, but also recognize limitations in
   the approach due to curricular and time constraints.},

Abstract = {The present study uses a short, computerized task to investigate
   individual differences among middle school students in terms of the
   intuitions and strategies that they use to compare fractions. To tap
   into their intuitions about fractions, students were presented with
   pairs of fractions on the screen for a limited time of 10s. Fraction
   pairs to be compared were controlled as to whether fractions shared or
   not a common component (numerator or denominator), as well as whether
   the greater fraction was the one with greater components or not. Data
   from about 500 students were processed with a clustering analysis based
   on these four item types, revealing distinct patterns of answers that we
   interpret in terms of strategies for answering the task. Half of the
   sample followed a simple larger-component-larger-fraction strategy as
   suggested by a congruency-based implementation of the natural number
   bias, although several clusters showed opposite patterns. These results
   show that a short, simple task can provide valuable information about
   students' individual differences in comparing fractions, useful for both
   research and practice in mathematics education. We discuss implications
   of these results for research and practice related to mathematics
   cognition and education.},

Abstract = {Researchers and policy-makers have recognized the importance of
   including and promoting socioscientific argumentation in science
   education worldwide. The Swedish curriculum focuses more than ever on
   socioscientific issues (SSI) as well. However, teaching socioscientific
   argumentation is not an easy task for science teachers and one of the
   more distinguished difficulties is the assessment of students'
   performance. In this study, we investigate and compare how science and
   Swedish language teachers, participating in an SSI-driven project,
   assessed students' written argumentation about global warming. Swedish
   language teachers have a long history of teaching and assessing
   argumentation and therefore it was of interest to identify possible gaps
   between the two groups of teachers' assessment practices. The results
   showed that the science teachers focused on students' content knowledge
   within their subjects, whereas the Swedish language teachers included
   students' abilities to select and use content knowledge from reliable
   reference resources, the structure of the argumentation and the form of
   language used. Since the Swedish language teachers' assessment
   correlated more with previous research about quality in socioscientific
   argumentation, we suggest that a closer co-operation between the two
   groups could be beneficial in terms of enhancing the quality of
   assessment. Moreover, SSI teaching and learning as well as assessment of
   socioscientific argumentation ought to be included in teacher training
   programs for both pre- and in-service science teachers.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the curriculum links between statistics and
   science that teachers need to understand and apply in order to be
   effective teachers of the two fields of study. Meaningful statistics
   does not exist without context and science is the context for this
   paper. Although curriculum documents differ from country to country,
   this paper uses extracts from three countries: Australia, New Zealand
   and the USA. The statistical ideas from the Australian Curriculum:
   Mathematics, the New Zealand Mathematics and Statistics Curriculum and
   the US Common Core State Standards for Mathematics are linked to the
   relevant parts of the Australian Curriculum: Science, the New Zealand
   Science Curriculum and the US Next Generation Science Standards for
   States, by States. Teachers of mathematics need to be aware of the
   potential of science to provide meaningful contexts within which to set
   statistical investigations. Similarly, teachers of science, who are
   developing methods for implementing investigations and experiments in
   their classrooms, need to be aware of the close ties to statistical
   tools for decision-making.},

Abstract = {Due to increased use of technology, the workplace practices of engineers
   have changed. So-called techno-mathematical literacies (TmL) are
   necessary for engineers of the 21st century. Because it is still unknown
   which TmL engineers actually use in their professional practices, the
   purpose of this study was to identify these TmL. Fourteen
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with engineers with a
   background in different educational tracks in higher professional
   education (e.g. civil, chemical, biotechnical and mechanical
   engineering). As a result of the data analysis, 7 commonly used TmL are
   identified: data literacy, technical software skills, technical
   communication skills, sense of error, sense of number, technical
   creativity and technical drawing skills. Engineers also noted a
   discrepancy between their education and workplace needs; they
   characterized mathematics in their education as an island with limited
   relevance. These findings lead to recommendations for the future of
   science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in higher
   technical professional education that can help students learn STEM for
   the future.},

Abstract = {This study describes a comparison of how worked examples in selected
   textbooks from England and Shanghai presented possible learning
   trajectories towards understanding linear function. Six selected English
   textbooks and one Shanghai compulsory textbook were analysed with
   regards to the understanding required for pure mathematics knowledge in
   linear function. Understanding was defined as being at five levels:
   Dependent Relationship, Connecting Representations, Local Properties
   Noticing, Object Analysis and Inventising. These levels were developed
   by examining the most prominent theories from the existing literature on
   understanding function. Findings suggested that the English textbooks
   constrained the structural aspect of understanding linear function due
   to a point-to-point view of function, while the Shanghai textbook which
   focussed on a variable view of function overemphasised the algebraic
   approach. The discussion explored the drawbacks to each approach and
   what teachers or textbook writers could do to balance these two
   approaches in order to facilitate students' understanding towards a
   structural view of linear function.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on one aspect of mathematical competence, namely
   mathematical reasoning, and how this competency influences students'
   knowing of physics. This influence was studied by analysing the
   mathematical reasoning requirements upper secondary students meet when
   solving tasks in national physics tests. National tests are constructed
   to mirror the goals stated in the curricula, and these goals are similar
   across national borders. The framework used for characterising the
   mathematical reasoning required to solve the tasks in the national
   physics tests distinguishes between imitative and creative mathematical
   reasoning. The analysis process consisted of structured comparisons
   between representative student solutions and the students' educational
   history. Of the 209 analysed tasks, 3/4 required mathematical reasoning
   in order to be solved. Creative mathematical reasoning, which, in
   particular, involves reasoning based on intrinsic properties, was
   required for 1/3 of the tasks. The results in this paper give strong
   evidence that creative mathematical reasoning is required to achieve
   higher grades on the tests. It is also confirmed that mathematical
   reasoning is an important and integral part of the physics curricula;
   and, it is suggested that the ability to use creative mathematical
   reasoning is necessary to fully master the curricula.},

Title = {Understanding the Idea of Chemical Elements and Their Periodic
   Classification in Spanish Students Aged 16-18 Years},

Abstract = {The work reported here involved a comparative study regarding the
   understanding that high school students (16-18 years) have of the
   concept of chemical elements and their periodic classification. More
   specifically, the level of knowledge on this topic was compared before
   and after the completion of baccalaureate studies in a sample of Spanish
   students. In order to achieve this goal, a questionnaire was developed
   that included 14 items in an open format, through which various aspects
   of the students' understanding of the idea of chemical element and their
   periodic classification were assessed. In addition, the application of
   this knowledge to interpret and predict the behaviour and properties of
   elements and to carry out calculations on the atomic composition of the
   elements was evaluated. Aspects concerning the acquisition of scientific
   knowledge, the application of knowledge to different contexts and
   situations, and the use of scientific evidence to draw conclusions and
   knowledge about the nature and history of science were evaluated. The
   questionnaire was previously validated with a large group of students.
   The results of this study show that improvements occur primarily in
   addressing higher level cognitive questions (analysis, synthesis and
   evaluation) in comparison to the lower level tasks (capacity for
   retention, understanding or direct application of learning). In
   addition, students who start high school have a very limited
   understanding of the ideas behind the Periodic Table of the chemical
   elements and that their lack of understanding, to a large extent,
   remains upon completion of the baccalaureate. These results suggest that
   there are real difficulties in understanding this topic and show the
   limited influence of the studies completed in high school.},

Abstract = {This article reports on an empirical exploration of the relations and
   strengths among Turkish grades 9-11 students' (n = 209) personal
   epistemologies (justification of knowledge, certainty of knowledge,
   source of knowledge, development of knowledge), self-regulated learning
   (extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation, rehearsal, elaboration,
   organization, critical thinking, metacognitive self-regulation), and
   achievement in physics (course grades). Established instruments were
   used to collect data on these students' beliefs about knowledge and
   components of self-regulated learning (SRL) such as goal orientations
   (extrinsic and intrinsic motivation) and learning strategies, critical
   thinking, and metacognitive regulation. Results from structural equation
   modeling revealed that students' personal epistemologies directly
   influenced their motivation (extrinsic and intrinsic goal orientations),
   rehearsal and organization strategies, and metacognitive self-regulation
   to learn physics. Furthermore, students' personal epistemologies
   indirectly (mediated through motivation beliefs) influenced rehearsal,
   elaboration and organization strategies, critical thinking, and
   metacognitive self-regulation to learn physics. Students' ideas about
   knowledge and knowing about the source and development of knowledge
   significantly contributed to students' self-regulatory skills and
   physics course grade. Implications and future directions are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study is purposed to measure the efficacy of implementing College
   and Career Readiness Standards (CCRS) math standards into math methods
   courses for early childhood and elementary education teacher candidates
   at an urban university located in the Dallas and Fort Worth metroplex
   area. A total of 161 college seniors (teacher candidates) enrolled in
   the mathematics methods courses for early childhood and elementary
   education participated in this study. The results showed that
   incorporating CCRS into the math methods courses was successful as shown
   by the significant findings between pre- and post-assessments in both
   skills-and knowledge-associated items. Although only two items were
   found to be significant between pre- and post-assessments on
   disposition, teacher candidates showed higher scores in pre- assessments
   on disposition compared to skills-and knowledge-associated items.},

Title = {THE APPLICATION OF THE ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS FOR EVALUATING
   CREATIVE PRODUCTS IN SCIENCE CLASS AND ITS MODIFICATION FOR EDUCATIONAL
   EVALUATION},

Abstract = {To design and to manufacture in science learning are increasingly
   important in science education. Yet, evaluation techniques in school for
   evaluating students' creative products are apparently left behind. With
   the aim of developing an evaluation method to evaluate creative products
   in science and technology class, this study constructed a set of
   criteria with data collected from teachers and students. The analytic
   hierarchy process (AHP), a multiple criteria decision-making tool for
   single rater, was selected for the purpose of weighting and evaluating
   students' products. However, the traditional AHP used one rater's
   pair-wise comparisons; its subjectivity and complexity limit its
   applications in school. For solving this problem, this study developed
   an advanced technique, called direct-rating AHP (DR-AHP), to extend the
   applicability of the traditional AHP. The DR-AHP is used to obtain
   weights or preferences for criteria/alternatives by a process of
   directly ranking criteria/alternatives by single/multi rater(s),
   checking consistency, and developing a rank vector matrix. The DR-AHP
   was implemented in obtaining criteria weights of a hierarchy framework
   for creative products evaluation by a group of science educators (N =
   13) and field-tested in ranking creative products by another group of
   science teachers (N = 9). Results showed its superiority in objectivity
   and efficiency over traditional ways of evaluation. The results also
   demonstrate how the AHP and DR-AHP are capable of helping evaluators
   systematically construct criteria and/or to evaluate students' creative
   products for classroom instruction as well as during many other
   activities.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of activity-based
   mathematics instruction on mathematics performance and investigate those
   factors, which contribute to the mathematics performance of a sample of
   children aged between 10 and 12 years. The study was designed to
   consider the impact of prior knowledge, self-regulation, prior attitude,
   and reading ability on students' mathematics performance. The data were
   collected by surveying the students using four instruments: achievement,
   attitude toward mathematics, self-regulation, and reading ability. The
   initial results indicated that activity-based mathematics instruction
   made a significant contribution to students' mathematics performance and
   mathematics attitude. Students with high prior knowledge and high
   self-regulation skills demonstrated greater gains in mathematics
   performance. Students with high prior knowledge also showed a more
   positive attitude toward mathematics. However, students with low prior
   knowledge and low reading skills showed the greatest gains in
   mathematics performance as measured by a retention test. Recent
   perspectives on the effect of activity-based instruction and the
   predictors of mathematics performance were described, and
   recommendations were offered.},

Abstract = {Scientific models and modeling play an important role in science, and
   students' understanding of scientific models is essential for their
   understanding of scientific concepts. The measurement instrument of
   Students' Understanding of Models in Science (SUMS), developed by
   Treagust, Chittleborough \& Mamiala (International Journal of Science
   Education, 24(4):357-368, 2002), has commonly been used to measure SUMS.
   SUMS was developed using the Classical Test Theory (CTT). Considering
   the limitations of CTT, in this study we applied a Rasch model to
   validate SUMS further. SUMS was given to 629 students in 18 classes of
   grades 9 and 10 from six high schools in China. The results present both
   additional evidence for the validity and reliability of SUMS and
   specific aspects for further improvement. This approach of validation of
   a published instrument by Rasch measurement can be applied to other
   measurement instruments developed using CTT.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I discuss Universal Basic Education (UBE) in relation to
   the teaching and learning of mathematics in Southern Africa. I present
   the status of UBE for all countries in the region and then use 3
   selected examples: Botswana, Malawi, and Zambia, to illustrate the
   provision of mathematics in the general framework of UBE in the
   countries. I draw from results of SACMEQ evaluations to compare the 3
   countries' quality of primary education and also the mathematical
   achievement of learners. According to the evaluations, countries that
   have better age-appropriate enrolment and provide a better quality of
   primary education seem to have better mathematical achievement than
   countries that have less age-appropriate enrolment and less quality of
   primary education. While this might seem obvious, it is important to
   note because of the many challenges that some Southern African countries
   are facing in their efforts in providing quality mathematics education
   to all.},

Title = {THE EFFECT OF KNOWLEDGE LINKING LEVELS IN BIOLOGY LESSONS UPON STUDENTS'
   KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Knowledge structure is an important aspect for defining students'
   competency in biology learning, but how knowledge structure is
   influenced by the teaching process in naturalistic biology classroom
   settings has scarcely been empirically investigated. In this study, 49
   biology lessons in the teaching unit blood and circulatory system in 9th
   grade German classrooms were videotaped and analyzed. Before the lesson,
   a questionnaire was administered to the students to solicit their
   responses about learning motivation. After the lesson, students'
   learning outcomes on knowledge structure were examined with the concept
   mapping method. The video coding used in this study focused on the
   knowledge linking levels during the biology lesson. Out of the 49
   classes, those with the highest and those with the lowest linking levels
   were selected based on the coding results. In high-linking classes,
   interrelated facts were introduced more often in the lessons, whereas in
   the lessons of the low-linking classes, isolated pieces of knowledge
   were predominant. The results from the concept mapping task showed that
   the students in the high-linking classes constructed more correct
   relations among the concepts compared to the students in the low-linking
   classes. The results remained stable even after controlling for learning
   motivation. These findings confirm the importance of teaching
   interrelated facts and concepts instead of isolated facts for fostering
   students' knowledge structure. As a result, based on the Bavarian
   biology curriculum, we develop materials and programs to enable
   students, student teachers, and teachers to focus on interrelated facts
   and basic concepts instead of isolated facts in biology lessons.},

Title = {DEVELOPMENT, EVALUATION, AND VALIDATION OF A PAPER-AND-PENCIL TEST FOR
   MEASURING TWO COMPONENTS OF BIOLOGY TEACHERS' PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT
   KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE ``CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM{''}},

Abstract = {One main focus of teacher education research concentrates on teachers'
   pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). It has been shown that teachers'
   PCK correlates with teaching effectiveness as well as with students'
   achievement gains. Teachers' PCK should be analyzed as one of the main
   important components to evaluate professional development programs. On
   this account, it is necessary to develop standardized measures of
   biology teachers' topic-specific PCK that are labor-efficient. This
   paper presents a study on the development, evaluation, and validation of
   a paper-and-pencil test to measure biology teachers' declarative PCK on
   the topic of blood and the human cardiovascular system. The development
   of the test was based, among other considerations, on a review of
   research literature on PCK and an analysis of 50 videotaped biology
   lessons. The final test instrument was comprised of 15 items distributed
   across 2 scales. The findings of the main study-with 93 preservice and
   in-service biology teachers and 12 biologists-confirmed that this
   measure of biology teachers' declarative PCK was reliable, objective,
   and valid. In-service biology teachers scored higher on the test than
   preservice teachers (effect size Cohen's d, 0.65) on one hand and, also,
   than biologists (Cohen's d, 1.00) on the other hand. Future versions of
   this test should explore enlarging the scales and measuring procedural
   aspects of PCK.},

Abstract = {This study examines the hypothesis that the more support beginning
   mathematics teachers perceive and the better they evaluate the
   management of their school, the higher their teaching quality is.
   Indicators of teaching quality were how the teachers, who were in their
   third year in the profession, regarded themselves able to cope with the
   challenges of mathematics instruction and generic tasks like classroom
   management and how satisfied they were with their job. Indicators of
   support were the level of appraisal and autonomy the teachers reported.
   School management indicators were the administrative leadership of the
   principal and the climate of trust as perceived by the teachers. Our
   results reveal that teacher support plays an important role in the
   quality of beginning mathematics teachers. All quality indicators
   improved significantly if beginning teachers reported more appraisal and
   autonomy. A climate of trust plays an important role for the extent of
   autonomy perceived. Administrative leadership was significantly related
   to the amount of appraisal the teachers reported. Our results provide
   important information on how to steer a school so that the quality of
   beginning mathematics teachers is maximized.},

Abstract = {Teacher education systems worldwide are confronted with the essential
   question of how to foster both future teachers' theoretical and
   practical knowledge and to adequately enable future teachers to connect
   their theoretical and practical knowledge for teaching. This article
   investigates how future teachers acquire general pedagogical knowledge
   (GPK) as a central component of teacher knowledge during initial teacher
   education, exemplified by pre-service teachers in Germany, where initial
   teacher education is divided into a first phase with a heavy focus on
   theoretical, academic study, and a second phase where future teachers
   learn how to apply their theoretical knowledge in the classroom. Data
   from teacher knowledge studies Teacher Education and Development Study
   in Mathematics and Langsschnittliche Erhebung padagogischer Kompetenzen
   von Lehramtsstudierenden/Longitudinal Survey of Student Teachers'
   Pedagogical Competencies are used to compare future teachers' GPK at
   different teacher education stages (the beginning, after 2 years, and
   end of training). Findings show the more advanced future teachers are in
   the course of their initial teacher education, the better they perform
   in the test measuring GPK. When analyzing subscales of the test
   measuring cognitive dimensions of GPK, as would be expected
   declarative-conceptual knowledge (measured by cognitive dimensions
   ``recall{''} and ``understand/analyze{''}) was gained predominantly
   during the theoretical study (first phase), whereas future teachers who
   had additionally passed through the practical second phase performed
   much better on the practical knowledge test subscale (measured by the
   cognitive dimension ``generate{''}). Research findings are discussed
   with regard to the development of teacher expertise during initial
   teacher education, and recommendations for future policy directions with
   respect to teacher education are given.},

Abstract = {This study examines new Turkish elementary school mathematics textbooks
   to provide perspectives on the quality of the tasks related to the
   proportion concept and the ways they are presented. Tasks were analysed
   for several dimensions with a particular focus on their level of
   cognitive demands (LCD). Tasks were distinguished in two groups in terms
   of LCD: lower-level demand and higher-level demand. The findings
   revealed that 75 \% of the tasks were related to higher-level demand in
   that they requested a certain level of interpretation, required
   connecting knowledge and procedures related to each other, demanded
   responses with some explanation and reinforced students' non-algorithmic
   thinking. Only 25 \% of the tasks were related to a lower-level demand,
   and these tasks could be resolved by recalling and implementing rules,
   procedures and factual knowledge without reflecting upon the meaning
   behind them. Most of the tasks were presented in multiple
   representations and framed in non-mathematical contexts. All these task
   characteristics indicate that the new elementary school textbooks have
   the capacity to promote students' proportional reasoning. The findings
   also inform the international community about crucial aspects of the
   curriculum reforms in Turkey and provide suggestions for teachers and
   textbook writers concerning the quality of the tasks and their selection
   and implementation in the classrooms.},

Abstract = {Students enter college chemistry courses with different sources of
   motivation, appropriate or inappropriate assumptions about their
   probability of success and how to study. This study is theoretically
   aligned with self-regulated learning research. Clearly, academic
   performance is closely related to student motivational beliefs and
   learning strategies. This study investigated the motivational beliefs
   and learning strategies of 2 years of college students in the second
   semester of organic chemistry. Responses to the Motivational Beliefs and
   Learning Strategies Questionnaire indicated that student self-efficacy
   was highly correlated with academic performance (semester grades).
   Gender differences were quite pronounced. Male academic performance was
   associated with intrinsic motivation as well as the importance placed on
   the learning task. Test anxiety was negatively associated with male
   grades. Extrinsic motivation was negatively correlated with female
   grades. Responses to students' sense of control over learning, the value
   of the learning task, and self-efficacy were significantly higher for
   males compared to females. Faculty who attend to these different
   patterns may influence beliefs as well as learning strategies.
   Correcting erroneous assumptions about how to learn chemistry may help
   students shift both their attitudes and their learning practices. The
   notable gender difference suggests that female chemistry students may
   especially profit from focused faculty intervention.},

Abstract = {This study examines the changes in teaching practices during the
   implementation of a pedagogical model called the mathematics reasoning
   approach (MRA), which was founded on 2 critical areas in mathematics,
   problem solving, and writing to learn. Three algebra teachers
   implemented the approach with their classes, which were divided into
   control (traditional) and treatment (student-centered approach) groups,
   with their levels of implementation measured by the Reformed Teaching
   Observation Protocol (RTOP) instrument. The implementation of the model
   resulted in positive changes in teachers' pedagogical practices and yet
   showed the struggles they faced. In the control classes (traditional
   classes), the level of teaching remained the same throughout the study,
   whereas in the treatment classes (MRA classes), a significant
   improvement in the level of teaching was observed. Even though the
   teachers' implementation levels differed from each other, the patterns
   of the change for all 3 teachers showed similarities; that is, their MRA
   teaching level was initially equivalent to their control teaching, but
   as the semester progress, there was a separation between the 2
   approaches. This separation between the 2 approaches appeared to be
   dependent upon the pedagogical area on which the teacher put emphasis.
   The skill of questioning seemed to be 1 which each teacher first
   changed.},

Title = {USING INTERNATIONAL STUDY SERIES AND META-ANALYTIC RESEARCH SYNTHESES TO
   SCOPE PEDAGOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AIMED AT IMPROVING STUDENT ATTITUDE AND

Abstract = {Taking lower-secondary schooling within the English educational system
   as an example, this paper illustrates the contribution of two bodies of
   international scholarship to the scoping of research-based pedagogical
   development aimed at improving student attitude and achievement in
   science and mathematics. After sketching the English context of systemic
   reform, the paper uses findings from the Trends in International
   Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) series to illuminate changes in
   performance, analysed within a framework of cross-system and
   between-subject comparison. Contrary to the optimistic picture from
   national assessment, the TIMSS findings suggest that systemic reform has
   produced fundamental gains only in student achievement in mathematics,
   and serious declines in student attitude towards both mathematics and
   science. Prompted by more favourable patterns elsewhere, the paper then
   triangulates the findings of recent meta-analytic research syntheses to
   identify promising lines of pedagogical development. Despite important
   differences in the conceptual frameworks and analytic methods of these
   syntheses, reasonably robust conclusions can be drawn about the
   effectiveness of four teaching components: domain-specific inquiry for
   student achievement in both subjects, student attitude in science, and
   learning processes in mathematics; cooperative group work for learning
   and attitude in science; contextual orientation for achievement in
   science; and active teaching for achievement in mathematics. Equally,
   discrepancies between findings or insufficiencies of evidence highlight
   a number of impacts particularly deserving deeper analysis or further
   investigation: cooperative group work on achievement outcomes, differing
   forms of learning assessment on both attitude and achievement outcomes,
   contextual orientation on outcomes in mathematics, and active teaching
   on outcomes in science.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to diagnose the misconceptions held by
   pre-service physics teachers about force and motion. The secondary aim
   of the study was to detect whether misconceptions vary according to
   gender, educational level, and culture. The study was conducted with 79
   student-teachers attending to one of the largest faculties of education
   in Turkey. Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was used to diagnose
   student-teachers' misconceptions. FCI is a conceptual test consisting of
   29 multiple choice items. Each wrong choice for each question reflects a
   specific misconception about the force and motion concepts. Data from
   the study was analyzed by using frequencies, t-test, and ANOVA for
   making comparisons according to gender and years of education. Results
   of the study showed that student-teachers of physics hold very strong
   misconceptions about impetus and active force. No significant
   differences were found between male and female students' scores on the
   concept test. The results also showed that misconceptions about force
   and motion decreased through the years of education. However, they did
   not disappear completely. Findings of the study are very similar to the
   other research findings conducted on the subject in other countries.
   Student-teachers' conceptions about Newton's Third Law, on the other
   hand, were significantly better than those observed in other research
   done in other countries such as the US and Finland.},

   performance in science courses methods courses. Analysis revealed that
   the four categories increased differentially in their science content
   knowledge, understanding of the Learning Cycle, science teaching
   self-efficacy, and confidence to learn science. Fearful science learners
   demonstrated less increases in science content knowledge and
   understanding of the Learning Cycle than the other three categories.
   Disinterested science learners demonstrated fewer gains in science
   content knowledge than Enthusiastic science learners. Fearful science
   learners were less confident to learn science than other categories.},

Abstract = {Because teachers' instructional practices are fundamental to the
   development of scientific reasoning ability, it is important that
   teachers become proficient in scientific reasoning. With such a premise,
   the study examined the scientific reasoning ability of teacher
   educators, schoolteachers, and prospective teachers in a province in
   Ethiopia. The study involved 37 (2 F; 35 M) teacher educators, 116 (51
   F; 65 M) prospective teachers, and 140 (57 F; 83 M) primary school
   teachers. Lawson's Test of Scientific Reasoning was administered to
   collect data. Analysis of the data showed that the participants
   generally had a low level of reasoning ability with 86\% of them
   classified as intuitive thinkers. Group comparisons revealed that
   teacher educators were better in reasoning ability than schoolteachers
   who in turn were better than prospective teachers. It is found that
   equal proportions of teacher educators were transitional thinkers and
   intuitive thinkers, but the vast majority of prospective teachers
   (94.8\%) and schoolteachers (88.6\%) were intuitive thinkers.
   Considering six dimensions of scientific reasoning, participants'
   difficulties in scientific reasoning were evident mainly in relation to
   hypothetico-deductive reasoning and control of variables. Implications
   of the results for curricula at different levels and teacher preparation
   programs are discussed.},

Abstract = {Linking assessment and curriculum in science education, particularly
   within the topic of matter and its changes, is often taken for granted.
   Some of the fundamental elements of the assessment, such as the choice
   of wording and visual representations, as well as its relation to the
   curricular sequence, remain understudied. In addition, very few
   assessment studies compare the reliability of assessments across
   different communities of students. In this study, we cross-examine the
   intersection between representation formats and educational contexts, in
   the analysis of students' performance on an assessment of the topic of
   matter and its changes. We developed two assessment forms with
   equivalent pictorial and verbal items to probe the reasoning of student
   groups in South Africa and Israel. Despite the vast differences between
   them, we found that in both groups, the pictorial versions of the items
   were generally easier than the verbal ones, except for items that
   included representations of motion using arrows. In addition, we found
   that the fitting of the pictorial items to the RASCH model was better
   than the verbal items in the South African group, indicating a lower
   reliability that is most likely related to language difficulties. We
   conclude that pictorial representations provide a better account of
   reasoning across cultural and curricular contexts, but when pictures
   include ambiguous symbols, especially when representing motion in a
   static picture - verbal descriptions may be more accurate for revealing
   the actual reasoning of students.},

Abstract = {Diagrams and in general the use of visualization and manipulative

   processes. Although several authors warn that mathematics objects should
   be distinguished from their possible material representations, the
   relations between these objects are still conflictive both from an
   epistemological point of view as well as an educational one. In this
   paper, we apply theoretical tools of the onto-semiotic approach of
   mathematics knowledge to analyze the diversity of objects and processes
   implied in mathematics activity, which is carried out with diagrammatic
   representations. This enables us to appreciate the synergic relations
   between ostensive (visual and sequential languages) and non-ostensive
   objects (abstract and mental entities) overlapping in mathematics
   practices. The analysis of the characteristics of diagrammatic reasoning
   and its interpretation in onto-semiotic terms is contextualized by means
   of the analysis of solving a problem about fractions by applying three
   procedures that involve diagrams.},

Abstract = {Even in the digital age, learning mathematics at an academic level still
   requires much reading of mathematical text. Research has shown that
   reading mathematical text requires readers to engage with all the
   structures of the book and with its pedagogical voice, making
   connections, and plausible reasoning. Specific practices and strategies
   that support the close reading of mathematical text have been suggested;
   however, descriptions and empirical evaluations of materials designed to
   support these activities are rare. We present the design and first
   evaluation cycle of materials developed in a design research project
   that aims to scaffold close reading of mathematical text. The materials
   were designed and evaluated in a German university course on elementary
   geometry for first-year teacher education students who study mathematics
   to become primary teachers. The reading strategies were explained and
   modeled for students in reading-strategy videos. Additionally, close
   reading of mathematical text was scaffolded by close-reading tasks and
   homework tasks and problems that build on the reading strategies and
   were specifically designed to foster understanding of the mathematical
   text. Survey data were collected from 296 students to evaluate their use
   of and attitude toward the different materials. The quantitative results
   indicate that students used the materials and were generally able to
   learn the course content by themselves. From all provided materials,
   they found the close-reading tasks most helpful. A qualitative analysis
   of answers to open questions revealed issues with different materials,
   particularly with the script, and requests for additional materials. The
   issues with the script were categorized inductively. The categories are
   presented as a qualitative result of the study and discussed.},

Abstract = {Reading, at its core, is a basic yet critical way to undertake learning
   and growth. This paper shares a professional learning and development
   initiative for science educators, which was underpinned by the
   popularity and premise of the reading group. In moving from simply being
   a vehicle for targeted discussion, the reading group facilitators sought
   to support the participants in taking a deeper dive into their practice
   with the impact ultimately being changes to their personal pedagogical
   content knowledge (PCK) for science. This small-scale qualitative study
   was informed by the voices of three science educators at different
   stages and career trajectories, who participated in interviews. The data
   revealed that their participation in the reading group informed the
   development of their personal and collective PCK by (a) creating
   conditions that encouraged meaningful links to be made between theory
   and practice, (b) encouraging the adoption of an inquiry stance as a
   means for engaging purposively with professional knowledge, and (c)
   initiating a transformation in their contemporary understandings of
   science and science education. By drawing on the participants'
   narratives, this study brings to the fore both the simplicity and depth
   of complexity that can be achieved through a reading group focused on
   professional learning and development. The implications of this research
   are wide reaching as the reading group as a concept can be applied to a
   variety of contexts and shaped to reach a variety of educational needs.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine the effect of the model-based science
   writing heuristic (M-SWH) approach on students' conceptual understanding
   and construction of model-based argumentations in elementary school
   science. Participants (N = 107) were students enrolled in 4 fourth-grade
   classes of a public elementary school. Two classes were assigned as the
   treatment group, and the other two classes were assigned as the
   comparison group in this quasi-experiment study. Students in the
   treatment group were instructed using the M-SWH approach, while a
   traditional approach was used in the comparison group. Tests measuring
   students' conceptual understanding of properties of matter and lighting
   and sound technologies units were administered to both groups as
   pretests and posttests; the M-SWH reports were used to assess the
   treatment group's ability to construct model-based argumentation.
   Descriptive statistics, t-tests, correlation analysis, and repeated
   measures ANOVA were used for data analysis. The results demonstrated a
   statistically significant difference in concept tests between the two
   groups in favor of the treatment group. These students' ability to
   construct arguments using models developed significantly throughout the
   implementation of the M-SWH approach. Moreover, treatment group
   students' conceptual understanding improved with their quality of
   writing.},

Abstract = {This multiple case study elicited the voices of four 8th grade students,
   from a rural, low-income school district, who participated in STEM
   career explorations during their science class. Based on students'
   written reflections during career explorations, interviews, and from
   field notes, we analyzed the ways students talked about their lives and
   experiences as they explored STEM-related careers, reflected upon the
   influences in their lives, and considered their futures. Students drew
   upon their interests and dispositions, primarily through home-based
   experiences, and often in spite of negative messages at school. Students
   aspired to live and work in their rural community, make their families
   proud, and sought financial stability in a career they would enjoy.
   Findings highlight the importance of out of school learning for these
   students, the important role of their families, and the prevalence of
   negative and racialized school experiences that often undermined
   students' potential. In many ways, students held perceptions reflective
   of racial and gender stereotypes about who is successful in STEM, which
   influenced their aspirations. This study provides examples of how
   constructs from the expectancy-value theory are
   operationalized-particularly with regard to cultural and social
   experiences-through the voices of these rural students. The findings
   from this study lead to a number of recommendations related to
   university outreach efforts into rural communities, culturally relevant
   teacher professional development and pre-service teacher preparation,
   and dissemination to support others and draw insight from underserved
   students' lives when undertaking steps to promote their futures.},

Abstract = {The present study examined data from the 2015 Trends in International
   Mathematics and Science Study to address cross-cultural differences in
   4th grade students' attitudes towards science and how students' sense of
   school belonging (SSSB) scores were related to attitude towards science.
   Regression results indicated that SSSB emerged as a significant,
   positive predictor of Students Like Learning Science (SLS) and Students
   Confident in Science (SCS) scale scores across countries. Additionally,
   statistically significant moderating effects for Taiwan were evident for
   the relationship between SSSB and both SLS and SCS scores. Specifically,
   when compared with students in the USA, the positive effect of SSSB on
   these attitudinal outcomes was less pronounced among students in Taiwan.},

Abstract = {In recent years, mathematical thinking and reasoning have been widely
   discussed to promote students' abilities to apply mathematical knowledge
   and ideas in their daily living. However, few studies have investigated
   the role of self-regulation in relation to reasoning. This study
   examined the effects of self-regulation processes on student
   mathematical reasoning and academic achievement. Using a quantitative
   research design and the PLS-SEM technique, data were collected from 248
   private school students in Malaysia. The PLS-SEM results showed that
   behavioral regulations, including processes of self-observation,
   self-judgment, and self-reaction, are decisive factors in influencing
   student academic achievement and student mathematical reasoning ability.
   The dimensions of motivational regulation, including processes of
   self-efficacy, task value, and mastery goal orientation, are dominant
   factors influencing student reasoning ability, followed by cognition
   regulation, which includes use of elaboration strategy and critical
   thinking skills. The study also found that cognition regulation is a
   significant mediator of the relationship between motivational regulation
   and reasoning ability. Behavioral and cognition regulation processes, as
   well as students' reasoning ability, are the mediators of motivational
   regulation on academic achievement. The results of this study suggest
   that teachers should foster the adoption of self-regulation processes in
   mathematics learning.},

Abstract = {Students' declining performance in science and mathematics is an issue
   of great international concern. Recently, educators and researchers have
   begun to focus on affective factors such as interest to better
   understand STEM learning and persistence. Therefore, there is a need for
   effective measures of STEM interest that allow it to be tracked over
   time and to provide opportunities for early interventions by educators.
   One such instrument was recently developed to measure youth interest in
   STEM as a general construct and in four domains associated with STEM:
   earth and space science, life science, technology and engineering, and
   mathematics. In this paper, we explore the psychometric properties of
   the measure scales by administering the instrument to a large sample of
   youth from both a traditional and STEM-focused school and examining
   theorized relationships using confirmatory factor analysis as part of a
   larger structural equation model. Results provided support for a single
   latent dimension of STEM interest, confirmed the existence of the four
   individual STEM interest dimensions, and provided evidence of structural
   and generalizability validity. We conclude that the instrument provides
   a sufficient means to measure STEM interest for adolescent youth within
   a variety of populations and educational contexts.},

Title = {An Investigation of Taiwanese High School Students' Basic Psychological
   Need Satisfaction and Frustration in Science Learning Contexts in
   Relation to Their Science Learning Self-Efficacy},

Abstract = {The purpose of the current research was to develop an instrument for
   high school students aiming to explore the satisfaction and frustration
   of their basic psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness, and
   competence while learning science and to investigate their relation to
   self-efficacy in science learning. This research involves two studies.
   In study 1, a total of 392 students (32\% females) were solicited from
   high schools in Taiwan. The results of exploratory factor analysis
   showed, as expected, that the students' responses were grouped into
   autonomy satisfaction, autonomy frustration, relatedness satisfaction,
   relatedness frustration, competence satisfaction, and competence
   frustration. The regression analysis results indicated that students
   whose psychological needs were satisfied displayed higher self-efficacy
   while learning science; however, students whose psychological needs were
   frustrated showed lower science learning self-efficacy. Study 2 involved
   699 students (33.5\% females) from high schools in Taiwan. The results
   of confirmatory factor analysis suggest that the survey items have good
   construct validity. The results of structural equation modeling also
   revealed that satisfaction of psychological needs was the positive
   factor in explaining self-efficacy; on the other hand, frustration of
   psychological needs did not predict self-efficacy. The findings revealed
   that the satisfaction of psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness,
   and competence provides potential impetus for positive functioning with
   respect to science learning.},

Abstract = {How to address the gender gap in STEM has been widely debated. Among the
   ways to encourage females to pursue STEM careers are outreach programs
   offered by schools and universities. This manuscript reviews the
   implementation of a novel program, the Women in Science Experience
   (WISE), a STEM-focused residential summer camp for high school females,
   located on the campus of a small university in the USA. Upon the
   conclusion of WISE, participants were asked to respond to a series of
   open-ended questions about their perceptions of science and science
   careers. Using thematic analysis, responses were coded and organized.
   Three themes emerged from this analysis. Love of Science showed how WISE
   participants appreciate science. Aspirations for Success resulted from
   career and life interests. Impact of WISE demonstrated how students'
   experiences at WISE affected future goals. The findings from this
   article speak to ongoing debates about how to maintain interest in STEM
   fields by females in secondary and post-secondary education.},

Abstract = {This mixed methods study explored how Saudi Arabia's science education
   reform is functioning in 2 public girls' secondary schools located in
   Dammam, 1 of the main cities in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia recently
   launched a new initiative to promote science education innovation by
   providing science curriculum change, professional development for
   science teachers, and progress towards a new educational system. This
   study examined Saudi secondary girls' perceptions regarding science
   learning environments and the metacognitive science learning orientation
   within the context of science education reform in Saudi Arabia (N =
   202). Further, 3 science teacher participants were interviewed in order
   to ascertain their perceptions of their current science teaching
   environments and their science teaching. Particular emphasis was placed
   on examining differences between the Course System, which is a new
   system designed to facilitate science experiments and constructivist
   teaching and learning, and the regular system in terms of students'
   perceptions about science learning environments and their metacognitive
   science learning orientation. Results and findings indicate that
   teachers supported the constructivist pedagogy, and science education
   reform efforts may gradually change Saudi science education environments
   and improve Saudi girls' science metacognitive learning orientation.},

Abstract = {This study follows a mathematical camp for high-school students
   identified as gifted, and examines it with a socio-cultural lens. Our
   goal is to examine the identities of students in the camp and the valued
   actions according to which these identities were authored, both by the
   students and by their instructors. Data was collected from three rounds
   of summer camp sessions and included recordings of lessons, staff
   meetings, and ceremonies. Findings point to identities of competent or
   ``gifted{''} participants being evaluated according to the valued
   actions of quickness and ease in problem-solving, ``brilliant{''} ideas
   or questions, persistence and coping with challenges, and intensive
   engagement with mathematics, beyond the official requirements of the
   camp. They also suggest that most of these valued actions were only
   implicitly communicated in the camp, although some of them, for example
   writing correctly and justifying statements logically, were stated
   explicitly. We focus on one student, Jasmine, who was identified as
   particularly gifted. We examine an episode of fierce mathematical
   argumentation between her and the instructor (2nd author), and the
   identifications that accompanied it, relating them to the valued actions
   in the camp. We discuss the findings with relation to existing
   literature on the identification and education of mathematically
   talented youth.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I introduce Sfard's discursive framework to examine
   secondary-school calculus students' communication during exploratory
   activities mediated by the use of touchscreen dynamic geometry
   environments (DGEs). Six pairs of secondary-school students participated
   in an open-ended task to explore calculus relationships using
   touchscreen-DGEs. Qualitative data capturing the students' linguistic
   communication (speech) and hand movements (gestures and dragging) were
   analysed when the students interacted with the touchscreen-DGEs used
   during the task. Findings suggest that new forms of communication were
   mobilised through the act of dragging on a touchscreen-DGE. In
   particular, routines for comparing, reasoning, conjecturing and
   verifying emerged within the use of the haptic DGE interface. In this
   paper, potentials of the touchscreen-DGEs in facilitating new forms of
   gestural thinking, as well as theoretical and methodological
   considerations that recognise the changing ways in which the hand and
   media interact, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Teachers should possess a robust knowledge of graph interpretation in a
   world that requires increasingly scientific citizens. This study aimed
   to investigate teachers' knowledge of interpreting a context-based line
   graph, by understanding the types of difficulties teachers have in
   interpreting such graphs. The study also sought to determine whether
   there were gender differences in teachers' graph interpretation skills
   and determine whether these interpretation skills were different among
   teachers with varying teaching experiences. Sixty-one teachers from ten
   districts in one Indonesian province participated in this study.
   Empirically derived items were developed to identify the teacher's
   conceptual understanding of line graphs with Curcio's (Journal for
   Research in Mathematics Education, 18(5), 382-393, 1987) level of
   interpretation applied to explain the difficulties encountered. This
   study revealed that most of the teachers had difficulty answering
   questions that required reading beyond the data'. Specifically, these
   teachers interpreted the graph as an iconic representation of a real
   event rather than an abstract representation of data (i.e., speed vs.
   time). Performance differences in teachers' understanding of the graph
   were dependent on the grade level they taught, with differences
   especially evident in the interpretation of moderate and difficult
   items. There were no differences in teachers' understanding by gender or
   years of teaching experience. The results highlight the importance of
   focusing on teacher professional development centering on teachers'
   knowledge of graph comprehension.},

Abstract = {Past studies have raised caution over educational transfer in
   mathematics education. The idea that an instructional approach to
   teaching and learning of mathematics can truly be universal and
   implemented across all cultures was challenged, as some aspects of the
   approach might be too closely bound up with the specific context where
   it was developed. As an illustration to this phenomenon, this study
   compares some classrooms that intended to utilize realistic mathematics
   education (RME) in its country of origin and in the place where it has
   been adopted for more than a decade. Some classrooms in Utrecht, the
   Netherlands and in Jakarta, Indonesia were observed and analyzed. The
   finding shows that the implementation of RME in the two places look
   similar on the surface but actually differ in many ways. This study
   suggests that the role of culture in the adoption of RME in Indonesia
   deserves due attention.},

Abstract = {This study compares the learning results of three groups of secondary
   two (grade eight) students of a similar academic standard who
   participated in a teaching intervention involving different pedagogies.
   One hundred and forty-nine Hong Kong secondary students were chosen and
   divided into three groups, whole-class teaching approach, group work
   with no specific strategies and group work with effective strategies, to
   study the space travel unit in their science curriculum. The first group
   was exposed to traditional whole-class instruction, and the latter two
   practised collaborative group work, with the third adopting four
   effective strategies derived from a UK-based quasi-experimental project.
   Analyses of the pre- and post-diagnostic assessments and audiotaped
   discussions revealed that group work comprising effective strategies not
   only raised students' test scores, but also enhanced their joint
   construction of conceptual knowledge in science. The findings suggest
   that the effective strategies adopted in this study are contributory
   factors to superior student accomplishments and a stronger desire to
   seek clarification accruing from shared cognitive activities.},

Abstract = {This study explored the training of prospective and practicing
   mathematics teachers in alternative assessment and its impact on their
   attitudes toward alternative assessment methods and their beliefs about
   the nature of mathematics. Data were collected from 51 prospective
   teachers and 50 practicing teachers who took a course on alternative
   assessment in mathematics. Findings indicated a significant change in
   the correlation between the positivist and constructivist dimensions of
   their beliefs about the nature of mathematics following the course. No
   significant differences were found between the prospective and
   practicing teachers' beliefs either before or after the course nor in
   their attitudes toward alternative assessment after the course. Before
   the course, however, the two groups differed significantly in their
   attitudes toward alternative assessment. Findings also revealed
   significant changes in attitudes toward alternative assessment and
   beliefs about the nature of mathematics following participation in the
   course. These changes in attitudes and beliefs were accompanied by a
   shift in the nature of the assessment tasks written by the participants.
   Participants who demonstrated more positive attitudes and constructivist
   beliefs tended to write more conceptual problems and less procedural
   exercises. Implications for mathematics teacher training and
   professional development in alternative assessment are discussed.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article was to find the connections between teachers'
   actions (N = 7) and their 3rd graders' performances (N = 86) when
   solving an open problem. A lot of information about the teaching
   sessions was gathered by video recordings and collecting pupils'
   solutions. Teachers' actions were analysed carefully through the phases
   of a problem-solving lesson (launch phase, explore phase, and discuss
   and summarise phase). Pupils' solution levels were categorised and their
   performances were compared in different teaching groups. Based on our
   data, teachers' way of teaching varied greatly in every phase. In the
   launch phase, the way in which the teachers presented the problem and
   especially how they illustrated the central concepts affected pupils'
   performances. The teacher's way of guiding and the choice of the
   equipment was central in the explore phase. However, even though some
   teachers revealed the central ideas of the solution during the launch
   and explore phases, this had no effect on the pupils' solutions.},

Abstract = {The constructivist learning approach is suggested as a means for
   facilitating students' learning of science and increasing their
   participation in this learning. Several studies have shown the
   contribution of this approach to the different aspects of students'

   contribution of this approach to the democratic environment of the
   science classroom. The present study attempted to do so. 34 grade 5
   science students studied the energy unit of the science book using the
   V-shape strategy, and 38 grade 5 science students studied the same unit
   without using the strategy. The research results show that students who
   used the V-shape strategy had significantly higher scores in democratic
   practices than students who did not use the strategy. Moreover, the
   democratic practices in the science classroom were not influenced
   significantly by the independent variables (science ability, general
   ability, and preferred subject). The results of the current study also
   show that, in the experimental group, only the correlation between
   involvement and freedom was significant, while in the control group, all
   of the correlations among involvement, freedom, and equality were
   significant.},

Abstract = {The Hong Kong Education Bureau recommends that primary school pupils'
   mathematical achievement be enhanced via collaborative discussions
   engendered by group work. This pedagogic change may be hindered by
   Confucian heritage classroom practices and Western-dominated group work
   approaches that predominate in Hong Kong. To overcome these obstacles,
   we introduced a relational approach to group work in a
   quasi-experimental study. Our sample included 20 teachers randomly
   allocated to experimental (12) and control (8) conditions and their 504
   mathematics pupils (aged 9-10). The relational approach focused on the
   development of peer relationships in a culturally appropriate manner and
   was implemented over 7 months. Pupils were pre-/post-tested for
   mathematical achievement and systematically observed, and the teachers
   were assessed for subject knowledge and pre-/post-tested for pedagogic
   efficacy. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and hierarchical linear
   modeling (HLM) results show enhanced mathematical achievement, supported
   by improved peer-based communication skills and time-on-task for the
   experimental pupils. Experimental teachers raised their pedagogic
   efficacy. Results indicate the potential of the relational approach for
   boosting academic achievement via enhanced child-peer-teacher
   interaction and the need to reassess the role of peer-based latent
   collectivist learning in Confucian heritage classrooms.},

Abstract = {Accessing children's feelings and attitudes towards mathematics is a
   challenging proposition since methods for data collection may be fraught
   in terms of bias and power relations. This article explores a method of
   collecting information from young students about their attitudes towards
   mathematics using iPads, and a video diary technique not dissimilar to
   the `Big Brother' room, with which many children are familiar. We
   describe the development of the tool and process when implemented in a
   primary school setting. We allude to both the enabling prospects of the
   technique as well as some of the limitations we found when implementing
   the method. We then discuss the implications of the largely negative
   attitudes and emotions that the students recorded and suggest that these
   negative attitudes are well formed by the end of the early years of
   schooling.},

Abstract = {One of the key courses in the mathematics teacher education program in
   Israel is arithmetic, which engages in contents which these pre-service
   mathematics teachers (PMTs) will later teach at school. Teaching
   arithmetic involves knowledge about the essence of the concept of
   ``number{''} and the development thereof, calculation methods and
   strategies. properties of operations on different sets of numbers, as
   well as the properties of the numbers themselves. Hence, the question
   arises: how to educate PMTs in order to supplement their mathematical
   knowledge with the required components? The present study explored the
   development of arithmetic thinking among pre-service teachers intending
   to teach mathematics at elementary school. This was done by matching the
   van Hiele theory of the development of geometric thinking to arithmetic.
   Analysis of findings obtained both in the present study and in many
   studies of geometry teaching indicates that this approach to considering
   the learners' level of thinking development might lead to meaningful
   learning in arithmetic course for PMTs.},

Abstract = {Underrepresentation of women of color in science majors and careers
   continues to be a concern for many science educators. Despite being the
   fastest growing population of college students, women of color have made
   insufficient gains in college science degree attainment. Sixteen women
   of color who were undergraduates majoring in a science field
   participated in three-part, in-depth interviews. Prominent factors
   associated with persistence as a science major included academic
   preparation for college science, faculty support, important school
   science experiences, family support, science support programs,
   altruistic beliefs, and the importance of religion. This study examined
   the data using current persistence theories as well as exploring the
   role of cultural and social capital as sources for support and
   motivation.},

Abstract = {The purposes of this study were to explore the effects of thinking
   styles on science achievement and attitudes toward science class among
   Taiwanese elementary school students and to explore the differences
   between male and female students in their modes of thinking.
   Participants included 756 sixth-grade students from 28 classes in four
   elementary schools in Taiwan. Data were collected from three data
   sources: (a) Style of Learning and Thinking to identify students'
   thinking style, (b) Science Achievement Test to assess students' science
   achievement, and (c) Asian Student Attitudes Toward Science Class Survey
   to measure students' attitudes toward science class. Findings revealed
   that across both boys and girls, there were significant differences
   between the three modes of thinking with regard to attitudes toward
   science class but no significant difference between the three modes of
   thinking with regard to science achievement. Even though students of
   both genders tended to be more holistic in their thinking, students with
   an analytic thinking style and an integrative thinking style showed more
   positive attitudes toward science class than students with a holistic
   thinking style. Taiwanese male students tended to be more holistic
   thinking than their female counterparts, whereas Taiwanese female
   students tended to be more analytic thinking in contrast to male
   students.},

Title = {THE EVALUATION OF ROLE-PLAYING IN THE CONTEXT OF TEACHING CLIMATE CHANGE},

Abstract = {Role-plays are a common pedagogical tool in the Social Sciences. As an
   imitation of societal practices, role-plays are thought to support the
   development of argumentation and decision-making skills among learners.
   However, argumentation and decision making are also goals in science
   education in general and in socioscientific issues-oriented science
   teaching in particular. This paper discusses a grounded theory (GT)
   approach to evaluating students' performance within role-playing
   exercises. The context is climate change. Data come from 4 different
   role-playing scenarios covering climate change which were developed in
   parallel for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Politics education.
   Role-plays in 20 different learning groups were videotaped (5 per
   subject). An evaluation pattern was developed step by step according to
   GT. Finally, graphic representations of all the role-plays were derived.
   The representations enable a quick overview of the role-plays and allow
   the identification of four basic types of role-playing: role-plays that
   are (1) completely directed by a group of student moderators, or (2) by
   the teacher, (3) medium-quality role-plays with a certain amount of
   interactivity and free argumentation, and (4) real, spirited debates.
   Implications for the use of role-playing exercises in science education
   are derived, including the induction of such role-plays through the use
   of role cards and the influence exhibited by teacher behavior.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to discussions on the multimodal nature of
   cognition through an elaboration of the ways multimodal aspects of
   thinking are exploited by learners doing mathematics. Moving beyond the
   fact that multimodality occurs, this paper focuses on how it occurs,
   with particular attention drawn to the complex network of perceptual,
   bodily and imaginary experiences of students. Through an analysis of 2
   selected episodes of the work of 1 primary school child learning to
   graph motion, the paper shows how the notion of blending spaces is
   central to understanding the mechanism of multimodality.},

Abstract = {This study investigated a sample of isiXhosa mother tongue-speaking
   science teachers', their pupils', and adult local community members'
   awareness of Xhosa indigenous knowledge. It also investigated what
   aspects of this knowledge they value and think should and could be
   integrated into the school science curriculum and their reasons for
   suggesting that it should (or should not) be incorporated. The
   participating teachers voluntarily completed an open-ended
   questionnaire. On completion, they were given the task of administering
   the questionnaire to at least 1 of their pupils and 1 community member
   who they believed could contribute ideas about indigenous knowledge that
   might relate to science education. Interviews were held with a small
   sample of teachers and community members. The data generated suggest
   that there is a shared awareness of indigenous knowledge across the
   respondents (teachers, pupils, and community members). The reasons given
   for including indigenous knowledge in the school curriculum related
   mainly to the realm of recognition (social justice and cultural
   sensitivity), and there was also little evidence that the respondents
   were aware of current understandings underpinning the demarcation of
   science and indigenous knowledge as disciplines.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore strategies used by
   high-achieving 6th grade students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to
   solve basic arithmetic problems involving number sense. The sample for
   the study consisted of 15 high-achieving boys and 15 high-achieving
   girls in grade 6 from 2 schools in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, UAE. Data
   for the study were collected through individual interviews in which
   students were presented with 10 basic problems. The results showed that
   a low percentage of solutions involved aspects of number sense such as
   appropriate use of benchmarks; using numbers flexibly when mentally
   computing, estimating, and judging reasonableness of results;
   understanding relative effect of operations; and decomposing or
   recomposing numbers to solve problems. It was also found that students
   were highly dependent on school-taught rules. In many cases, these rules
   were confused and misused.},

Abstract = {Many students encounter difficulties in science and mathematics. Earlier
   research suggested that although intuitions are often needed to gain new
   ideas and concepts and to solve problems in science and mathematics,
   some of students' difficulties could stem from the interference of
   intuitive reasoning. The literature suggests that overcoming intuitive
   interference is associated with the activation of inhibitory control
   mechanisms. The goal of the current study was to find out whether indeed
   the reasoning processes associated with overcoming intuitive
   interference are different from the ones related to answering correctly
   in line with the intuition. To do so, we focused on the
   comparison-of-perimeters of geometrical shapes task that triggers
   intuitive responses and applied the prime-probe paradigm. High school
   students were presented with pairs of congruent and incongruent trials
   of different combinations. The findings showed that previous trial
   congruity affects response times of the probe. When congruent trials
   followed incongruent prime, an increase in response time was observed as
   compared with congruent trials that followed congruent ones, and vice
   versa. In addition, when congruent trials followed incongruent-equal
   prime, not only did response time increase but accuracy significantly
   dropped as well. The current study supports the suggestion that
   inhibitory control mechanisms play a key role in overcoming intuitive
   interference, even in adolescence, and points to the importance of
   enhancing students' inhibitory control mechanisms.},

   We analyze the data on 2 levels: macro-level analysis, dealing with

   mathematical tasks and the quality of whole-class discussion. We analyze
   teacher participation in LS to identify the main mechanisms leading to

   collaborative noticing, collaborative awareness, and brainstorming are
   the core mechanisms of teacher change in the course of LS.},

Abstract = {This paper is a report of a study that examines the relationship between
   teacher participation in a multi-year, K-6 professional development
   effort and the ``high stakes{''} science test scores of different
   student groups in 33 rural mid-west school districts in the USA. The
   professional development program involved 1,269 elementary school
   teachers and utilized regional summer workshops and distance delivery
   technologies to help the teachers learn science concepts, inquiry
   teaching strategies, and how to adapt science inquiry lessons to teach
   and reinforce skills in the language arts. Regression analyses revealed
   a significant positive relationship between the professional development
   hours experienced by teachers and student gains on high stakes test
   scores. But the analyses also suggest that primary grade teachers need
   less professional development than upper grade teachers on instructional
   strategies where the focus is on the integration of language arts and
   science inquiry. The implications for funding and implementing

Abstract = {We varied the spatial features of adjunct displays that depicted a
   complex scientific system (i.e. human circulatory system). University
   students (n = 47), who were assigned randomly to a display condition
   before reading, selected relevant information from the text and wrote it
   (a) next to a list of definitions (list condition), (b) inside boxes
   organized to coincide with the sequence of blood flow (chart condition),
   or (c) on a picture of the heart (pictorial condition). Students in the
   chart and pictorial conditions had higher scores on 2 learning tests.
   Results supported the nonequivalence hypothesis, which states that a
   spatial display can promote learning more effectively than a list
   because a display's nonverbal (e. g. spatial) features explicitly depict
   relationships among a system's components. The results have implications
   for science educators.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the instructional coherence in a Chinese
   mathematics classroom by analyzing a sequence of four videotaped lessons
   on the topic of fraction division. Our analysis focused on the
   characteristics of instructional coherence both within and across
   individual lessons. A framework was developed to focus on lesson
   instruction in terms of its content and process and the teacher's use of
   classroom discourse. The analyses of lesson instruction were further
   supplemented with the analyses of teaching materials and interviews with
   the teacher. The findings go beyond previous studies that mainly focused
   on a single lesson to provide further evidence about Chinese teachers'
   instructional practices and their possible impact on students' learning.
   In particular, the teacher tried to help students build knowledge
   connections and coherence through lesson instruction. Results also
   suggest that coherent curriculum and the teacher's perception of the
   knowledge coherence facilitated the teacher's construction of coherent
   classroom instruction.},

Abstract = {This article reports a case study that described and analyzed the
   changes in the Danish school culture induced and encouraged by the
   Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results. The
   educational policy and reforms that were temporally connected with the
   publication of the PISA 2000 results are outlined and the related
   socioeconomic and sociopolitical influences are explicated. Furthermore,
   we investigated to what degree the PISA science assessment framework and
   test system were in accordance with the Danish educational goals in
   science in order to discuss the relevance of PISA as a catalyst for the
   educational actions taken. The results of our inquiry revealed areas of
   good correspondence and fundamental differences related to values
   underlying the Danish school system and PISA, respectively (e. g.,
   Bildung orientation versus cognitive skills/competency orientation,
   different learning/assessment paradigms). We argue that such differences
   are crucial when considering curricular relevance, validity, and the use

Abstract = {Many national and international studies put forward the idea that
   primary education in Turkey is questionable in many aspects. As a
   result, the Ministry of National Education changed primary curriculums
   in 2004 in Turkey. The curriculum for primary mathematics was
   redeveloped taking into consideration constructivist theory of
   education. The purpose of this study is to assess the qualities of the
   2004 mathematics curriculum using a goal-oriented curriculum evaluation
   model in which the intrinsic value of the curriculum is examined in
   terms of its qualities and success depending on teachers' perspectives,
   as they are one of the most important elements of the teaching-learning
   situation. The results show that the qualities of the 2004 mathematics
   curriculum match the criteria of a constructivist curriculum as set out
   in the literature. Also, the level of performance expected from the
   teachers' perspective as those who instruct in the curriculum is very
   high. The results point to the fact that the 2004 mathematics curriculum
   may be considered as a positive change even if there is room for
   improvement in all aspects.},

Title = {LEARNERS' AND TEACHERS' CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE PROCESSES: THE
   CASE OF BOTSWANA},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The conceptual knowledge of science processes possessed by University of
   Botswana science students and senior secondary school science teachers
   was sought through a three-part questionnaire. One part requested
   demographic data of subjects, the second part asked them to select their
   level of familiarity with the processes, and the third part probed their
   conceptual definitions of the science processes. The definitions were
   scored as incorrect, partially correct and correct on an ordinal scale.
   Statistical analysis was done using Spearman rho correlation and one
   sample t test. The findings revealed that the science teachers did not
   have sufficient conceptual knowledge of science processes to help their
   students to understand in a meaningful way; both students' and teachers'
   views of their familiarity of science processes did not corroborate
   their demonstrated ability to provide acceptable conceptual definitions
   of the processes; there was no association between students' and
   teachers' conceptions of the science processes; and if conceptual
   knowledge of science processes was demanded, the entering students, who
   were the immediate graduates of the senior secondary schools, might not
   have enough to pursue tertiary level science courses. It is suggested
   that both conceptual and operational knowledge of science processes be
   required at secondary and tertiary levels of science education.},

Title = {Relationship Between Opportunity to Learn, Mathematics Self-Efficacy,

   Economies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 utilized
   data from 63 countries and economies to generate research questions that
   centered on the contribution of mathematics self-efficacy, opportunity
   to learn (OTL), and how their interplay affected students' mathematical
   performance. This study reveals that in a majority of the surveyed
   countries/economies, students' OTL can enhance the positive relationship
   between mathematics self-efficacy and mathematical performance. Path
   analysis further demonstrates that in 61 out of the 63
   countries/economies, students' OTL positively affect their mathematics
   self-efficacy, which subsequently enhances mathematical performance. It
   was observed that students with more OTL typically exhibit higher math
   performance, but this effect is explained by the mediating influence of
   having more mathematics self-efficacy.},

Title = {Improving the Professional Awareness of Mathematics Teachers and Teacher
   Instructors Using Video-Based Curiosity-Driven Discourse-a Case Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 26},
Abstract = {This paper describes and analyzes three cases to show the impact that
   curiosity-driven (CD) discourse based on self-video can have on the
   professional awareness and noticing skills of mathematics teachers and
   instructors of mathematics teachers. The findings indicate that CD
   discourse raises awareness of heretofore unnoticed events in the lesson,
   and improves the mathematical and pedagogical knowledge, teaching
   skills, and efficacy of teachers and instructors. This study combines
   pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of teachers with Mason's ``levels of
   awareness{''} model in studying, from an epistemological point of view,
   the contribution that CD discourse makes to growth of professional
   awareness in mathematics teachers and instructors. Thus, this study
   contributes to the theoretical and practical understanding of the growth
   of mathematics teachers as teachers and as teacher instructors, in their
   professional awareness, noticing skills, and attention shifting.},

Title = {Estimating the Competence of Preservice Primary Teachers to Use Inquiry
   and Their Willingness to Apply It in the Classroom},

Abstract = {Inquiry as a strategy for science teaching has become widespread in the
   classroom and has various applications. But whether teachers are
   sufficiently trained to carry it out in pre-university classrooms would
   need to be determined. The objective of this study is to determine the
   inquiry knowledge of preservice primary teachers and their ability to
   use it before and after experiencing it for themselves on their degree
   programmes. The study was carried out over three academic years
   (2018-2021) with students from the Experimental Sciences course on a
   Bachelor's Degree in Primary Education at a teacher training centre in
   Spain. A total of 579 students participated and the study was divided
   into two phases. In the first phase, students answered a questionnaire
   about a hypothetical situation in which they had to apply inquiry, and
   in the second phase, they worked in groups on problematic situations in
   which they had to solve them or propose solutions through inquiry. The
   results indicate that students have a general ability to follow inquiry
   procedures, which improves after instruction, although they still need
   training in didactic content on inquiry methodology. Students were also
   asked about their willingness to apply inquiry in their future work, as
   well as the difficulties they consider they will encounter. A number of
   recommendations are made to address the shortcomings and to overcome the
   difficulties expressed by students in applying inquiry in their future
   teaching work.},

Abstract = {Citizen science offers teachers a way to bring authentic scientific
   research into their classrooms by providing both teachers and their
   students with opportunities to contribute to authentic research. The
   potential of citizen science for science education has already been
   highlighted in various fields and by various stakeholders. More and more
   studies underpin this potential by providing evidence for the learning
   outcomes achieved through participation in citizen science projects. In
   formal education settings, teachers are the gatekeepers for teaching
   innovations and, hence, the ones who decide whether to engage students
   in citizen science. However, the expertise of teachers who have already
   participated in citizen science with their students has not been studied
   on a broad international level. Therefore, to investigate their
   experience and learn from their expertise, this study employed a
   concurrent triangulation design and invited teachers to participate in a
   survey (N = 56) and an interview (N = 11), independent of their country
   of residence, their school type, and their teaching subject. The results
   provide insights into teachers' motivation, the engagement techniques
   and types of activities they used, the challenges they faced, and their
   recommendations for implementing citizen science in formal education
   settings. The present findings have important implications for the
   design of professional development programmes and support networks for
   teachers in citizen science.},

Abstract = {To cope with an unpredictable future, higher education in mathematics
   and science (MS) needs to educate a knowledgeable and skilled workforce.
   Co-operative learning (CL) is a teaching method associated with
   increased academic achievement and development of generic skills. Thus,
   the purposes of this scoping review are to assess the evidence base of
   CL in undergraduate MS education to inform teaching practices and to
   identify potential knowledge gaps to inform future research. The review
   covers 24 empirical studies conducted from 2010 to 2020 on the
   prevalence, uses, and outcomes of CL elements in undergraduate MS
   education. The results show that there are few such studies, and these
   are rarely conducted outside the US or in disciplines other than
   chemistry. The most frequently implemented CL elements in the included
   studies are heterogeneous group formation, the use of roles, and
   different CL structures. The most prevalent student outcome of
   implemented CL elements in the reviewed studies is enhanced academic
   success, followed by student attitudes, generic skills, and
   psychological health. The results have implications for future
   implementation of and research on CL in international MS higher
   education.},

Abstract = {This study explored the unique integration of mathematics tutors in
   teaching high school mathematics in a Virtual mathematics school (VMS).
   The tutors were three excelling STEM students who did not have any
   formal preparation for teaching before their work in the VMS. The goal
   of the study presented in this paper was to design a model of
   proficiency for these tutors. The model was designed using multiple case
   study methodology by tracking the learning through teaching of the
   tutors. Activity theory (Leontiev, 1978) framed the design of the study
   and led to a ``goal-action{''} model of the tutors' proficiency in the
   VMS. The goals part of the model is rooted in the construct of students'
   mathematical potential (Leikin, 2021), and the action part was unraveled
   using the construct of a Teaching Triad (Jaworski in For the Learning of
   Mathematics, 12(1), 8-14, 1992). In this paper, we illustrate how our
   model can be used to analyze changes in the tutors' proficiency, and how
   it can be applied to descriptive, explanatory, and analytical power.},

Abstract = {Teachers' mathematical knowledge has important consequences for the
   quality of the learning environment they create for their students to
   learn mathematics. Yet relatively little is known about how teachers
   reason proportionally, despite the fact that proportional reasoning is
   foundational for several mathematics concepts and that ratios and
   proportional relationships constitute a major component of the middle
   school mathematics curriculum. In this study, we investigated how
   teachers reasoned proportionally on a nonroutine ratio task and the
   extent to which their proportional reasoning was able to predict their
   overall understanding of the relevant concepts: ratios and proportional
   relationships. Using data collected from 238 US mathematics teachers, we
   found that teachers' proportional reasoning could be grouped into four
   categories: incorrect, additive, relative, and proportional reasoning.
   Our results also indicated that teachers' overall knowledge of ratios
   and proportional relationships aligned with the way they reasoned
   proportionally, meaning that teachers who used incorrect reasoning on a
   separate task received the lowest scores on average on the ratios and
   proportional relationships measure, whereas those who reasoned
   proportionally had the highest mean scores on average. Implications of
   the study include the need to shift attention to the way teachers reason
   in relation to the two elements of proportional reasoning (covariance
   and invariance) to capture the nuances in their understanding of ratios
   and proportional relationships.},

Abstract = {Although the effects of professional development programs on teachers'
   noticing skills have attracted considerable interest among mathematics
   education researchers, little is known about the developmental process
   of prospective teachers' noticing skills within initial teacher
   education. This paper examines the extent to which prospective teachers'
   noticing skills are developed through the mathematics education courses
   taken within the mathematics teachers' education program using
   exemplarily the topic division of fractions. The study is grounded on
   the framework of Professional Noticing of Children's Mathematical
   Thinking which specifies three facets of noticing, that are attending,
   interpreting, and deciding how to respond. Twenty-two prospective
   mathematics teachers (PSTs), who were enrolled in the Middle School
   Mathematics Teacher Education Program at a Turkish university,
   participated in this study. The results revealed that most PSTs gained
   expertise in all three kinds of noticing skills during their teacher
   education. The highest progression could be identified in the
   interpretation skills and the lowest in attending skills. These results
   are important for initial teacher education programs, highlighting that
   general, non-specialized mathematics education courses within initial
   teacher education have the potential to provide an efficient
   professional development program to develop PST's noticing skills. The

Abstract = {Canonical coherence occurs when subject matter in school is organized to
   align with the logical structures of an academic discipline. Even though
   it is highly desired, this condition is an assumption that must be
   empirically tested, which was the rationale behind our examination of
   the coherence of topics from middle-school (grades 7-9) integrated
   science textbooks from Taiwan and Korea. We wanted to determine if
   textbooks here were able to present science in a way that made it
   conceptually easier for students to learn and the means whereby
   coherence was achieved. Based on a list of ``standard{''} science topics
   from Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) research,
   our comparative study found that while the number of science topics
   varied by grades and region, their total numbers did not differ
   significantly. Both regions also focused strongly on physical science
   topics based on textbook page coverage even as different topics were
   emphasized (or not). In Taiwanese textbooks, topics were strongly
   grouped by disciplines in each middle-school grade (a specialist
   approach) whereas topics from the three main science disciplines were
   dispersed within each middle-school grade over an academic year in Korea
   (a generalist approach). Coherence of topics in both regions was found
   to be supported through a mix of desirable upper triangular patterns
   within the main science disciplines as well as buttress topics that
   develop disciplinary ideas over time. The results from our study can
   create greater awareness of the significance as well as challenges of
   achieving canonical coherence of topics in science textbooks, especially
   with respect to integrated science subjects that are extremely common
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {The seven articles that comprise this Special Issue examine the
   professional growth of mathematics and science teacher educators across
   different contexts and different foci of who is the teacher educator
   being studied. Despite these differences, a common thread running
   throughout these seven articles is the need for learning to be situated
   in collaboration with others. In this final article, we examine the
   contribution of these articles through two perspectives: that of the
   collaborative contexts supporting the professional growth of mathematics
   and science teacher educators, and the role of disciplinary knowledge as
   part of the purpose for teacher educators' professional growth. We
   notice that collaboration can take on very different structures in
   supporting teacher educators' professional learning due to the different
   purposes and roles of the teacher educators in the studies. We also
   notice that while collaboration figures as an important component in all
   of the studies, the disciplinary specific aspects of collaboration,
   i.e., how collaboration might be negotiated differently by teacher
   educators in mathematics and science, is still not well understood.
   Overall, these articles provide important insights that help to shed new
   light on the complex and multifaceted nature of teacher educators'
   learning and growth and provide productive avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {Using the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we examine the
   association between taking Algebra I by the eighth grade and students'
   later achievements and advanced mathematics course-taking. To explore
   our research questions, we employ three distinct methods-regression
   analysis, fixed effects models, and propensity score matching. In all
   our analytic models, we consistently found that students who have taken
   Algebra I by the eighth grade are more likely to have higher
   achievements in the ninth and eleventh grades and to take classes beyond
   Calculus during high school. Although the study is correlational,
   considering the increasing number of students taking Algebra I by the
   eighth grade, its findings have meaningful implications for education
   policy, research, and practice.},

Abstract = {This study presents a characterization of prospective early childhood
   teachers' (ECEPTs) and prospective elementary school mathematics
   teachers' (EMEPTs) concept images and concept definitions of triangles
   through a defining task and an example generation task. Data consisted
   of 62 EMEPTs' and 72 ECEPTs' written statements for the definition of a
   triangle, drawings for examples and non-examples of triangles, and
   written reasons for drawings. The results showed that most of the
   prospective teachers wrote inappropriate statements for the definitions
   of a triangle by using necessary but not sufficient conditions or using
   neither necessary nor sufficient conditions with frequent inaccurate
   terminology usage. The appropriate statements for the definition of a
   triangle included necessary and sufficient conditions, but were mostly
   considerably not minimal and/or included inappropriate mathematical
   terminology. A very large portion of the examples drawn by the
   prospective teachers consisted of acute triangles with typical positions
   rather than right and obtuse triangles, which can be evaluated as the
   indication of prototypical concept images. Drawings of non-triangles
   also revealed that the prospective teachers mostly drew non-triangular
   non-examples that can be immediately accepted as non-triangles with the
   lack of a relatively long list of missing critical attributes, but they
   provided a small number of triangular non-examples that bear significant
   similarity to valid examples of a triangle. This result indicates that
   the prospective teachers' concept images regarding non-triangles also
   formed by intuitive non-examples which can be considered as prototypes
   for non-triangles.},

Abstract = {A learning format gaining attention that encourages language acquisition
   in science is the use of dynamic models as instructional tools. This
   grounded theory investigates the impact of the dynamic food chain model
   as an alternative lesson for teaching food chains. The researchers
   examined the impact of a paper-based activity and a dynamic model
   activity on 5th grade students' content knowledge and language
   development. A total of 96 English learners (ELs) and 62 native English
   speakers participated. Data were collected using a What I Did/What I
   Learned reflection and analyzed qualitatively. Results indicate that ELs
   exceeded native speakers in academic language development and in
   understanding interconnectedness of organisms. In addition, students
   engaging in the dynamic model activity expressed more joyful learning
   than students in the paper-based activity.},

Abstract = {This study investigates factors that influenced the science, technology,
   engineering and mathematics (STEM) subject enrolment decisions of Year
   12 students in Australia. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is used to
   develop a model using Programme for International Student Assessment
   (PISA) and Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth (LSAY) data with
   participating students (N = 7442) from 356 schools. An adapted version
   of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), a behavioural prediction
   model, is used as the guiding conceptual framework. Students'
   demographic background, attitudes towards science and achievement in
   science and mathematics at age 15 are used as predictors for subsequent
   enrolment in STEM subjects in Year 12. Gender, socio-economic status
   (SES) and immigrant status (native vs. non-native) are shown to be
   contributing factors. The personal value of science, enjoyment of
   science, self-concept in science and achievement (mathematics and
   science) are mediating factors in the model. These findings provide
   schools, policymakers and educational advisors with a greater
   understanding of the factors that influence Australian students'
   decisions of whether to enrol in a STEM subject at Year 12. Evidence
   provided allows key stakeholders to take a more targeted approach to
   enhance STEM participation for students from varying demographic
   backgrounds.},

Abstract = {Little research has been done to examine the impact of informal science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning on middle
   school students' career aspirations. Participants included 507 incoming
   fifth through eighth graders from underrepresented populations in STEM
   fields, which were recruited at three sites. Data collected included
   semi-structured interviews, session reflection forms, and surveys
   administered before and at the end of the STEM summer learning
   experience. Social Cognitive Career Theory was used to examine the
   extent middle school students' experiences at a STEM summer learning
   experience influenced their interest in STEM careers. Quantitative data
   were examined related to self-efficacy. Self-efficacy scores after the
   STEM learning experience were significantly higher than initial
   self-efficacy scores and justified further qualitative analyses. A
   deductive approach was used to analyze the qualitative data. The themes
   of role models, influence of the STEM summer learning experience,
   applicability of STEM, and empathy were revealed. Many students reported
   they were drawn to a specific STEM career because they wanted to help a
   person for whom they care about, such as a sibling with an illness or a
   family member battling cancer. This study demonstrates the need to
   provide all students the access and opportunity to engage in authentic,
   hands-on learning experiences that connect STEM to their daily lives,
   increase their interest in STEM, and introduce them to different STEM
   careers so they make more informed decisions about future STEM career
   choices and suggests that the role empathy plays in fostering students'
   interest in STEM be further examined.},

Abstract = {By providing students with a highly interactive and hands-on learning
   experience, robotics promises to inspire a new generation of
   mathematical learning. This paper aims to review the empirical evidence
   on the application of robotics in mathematics education and to define
   future research perspectives of robot-assisted mathematics education.
   After a systematic search in online database via keyword search and
   snowballing approach, we analyzed 20 empirical studies on how to teach
   and learn mathematical knowledge through robotics. The results indicate
   that (1) most studies were conducted with a small sample size, the
   largest research groups were elementary school students and secondary
   school students, most studies used LEGO robots, robots were primarily
   applied to teach and/or learn graphics, geometry, and algebra, and
   almost half of the studies taught mathematics by engaging students in
   game-like interactions with robots; (2) half of the studies adopted a
   non-experimental research design, and most studies evaluated student
   performance through observation, test/examination, questionnaires, or
   verbal interviews; and (3) instructional implications proposed in the 20
   papers can be clustered into four themes: human-robot interaction,
   connections between mathematics and real life, pedagogical suggestions,
   and facility conditions. The 20 papers suggest that robotics generally
   plays an active role in mathematics education; however, there are indeed
   situations in which no significant improvement was found in students'
   mathematical learning. In view of this, we prospect the future research
   perspectives of robot-assisted mathematics education and propose that
   more rigorous intervention studies could be conducted to further explore
   the integration of robotics and mathematics education.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the mechanisms by which students' cultural
   background plays an active role in the study of mathematics. It does so
   with the aid of two main constructs: hybrid discourse and intellective
   identities. At the center of the article is an analysis of a classroom
   episode from a preparatory program in which adult ultra-orthodox Jews
   study high school mathematics for the first time. We show how different
   cultural resources, among them students' cultural preference for
   disagreement, are being used to create a new hybrid discourse of
   mathematics and the Talmud while discussing the veracity of a
   mathematical proof. The hybridity can be seen in four characteristics of
   discourse: routines for endorsement of narratives, interactional
   routines, authority structure, and purpose of learning. We elaborate on
   the process by which this hybridity is constructed through students'
   positioning actions and the ways in which these positions are supported
   by students' intellective identities.},

Abstract = {The calculus concepts of concavity and inflection points are critical
   for a complete understanding of quantities' behavior, making them
   important topics of research for those interested in the intersections
   of STEM disciplines. This study seeks to provide insight into this area
   by reporting on trends in students' concept projections of these
   concepts in a range of real-world contexts, including temperature,
   economics, human height, and the universe's expansion. While the
   students mostly thought of concavity and inflection points in pure
   mathematics as shapes associated with graphs, the projections with the
   real-world contexts were based much more on changing rates of change.
   Pedagogically important student confusions were also evident in their
   attempts at applying concavity and inflection points to the real-world
   contexts, and this paper uses the concept projection perspective to
   identify possible sources of these confusions.},

Abstract = {The emphasis of reform-oriented science education today focuses on
   engineering integration in K-12 science classrooms. However, there is
   little research, particularly longitudinal research, on how different
   approaches to engineering integration influence student learning and
   interest. To address this gap in the literature, this study analyzed a
   middle school life science teacher's enactment of three design-focused
   life science units and student performances over a 3-year period.
   Findings indicate that the design and enactment of each unit reflects a
   unique engineering integration approach: add on, implicit, and explicit.
   Moreover, the ways the teacher talked about engineering varied among
   each curriculum unit. Through the analyses of 330 students' pre- and
   post-content tests and interest surveys as well as videotaped classroom
   instruction, we found that explicit engineering integration and
   engineering language use in classroom instruction resulted in higher
   student learning gains in science and engineering, but they did not have
   significant effects on students' interest in science and engineering. We
   explore the implications for curricular materials and discuss a need for
   long-term professional development and support for teachers.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was, first, to understand the item hierarchy
   regarding students' understanding of scientific models and modeling
   (USM). Secondly, this study investigated Taiwanese students' USM
   progression from 7th to 12th grade, and after participating in a
   model-based curriculum. The questionnaire items were developed based on
   6 aspects of USM, namely, model type, model content, constructed nature
   of models, multiple models, change of models, and purpose of models.
   Moreover, 10 representations of models were included for surveying what
   a model is. Results show that the purpose of models and model type items
   covered a wide range of item difficulties. At the one end, items for the
   purpose of models are most likely to be endorsed by the students, except
   for the item models are used to predict. At the other end, the model
   type items tended to be difficult. The students were least likely to
   agree that models can be text, mathematical, or dynamic. The items of
   the constructed nature of models were consistently located above the
   average, while the change of models items were consistently located
   around the mean level of difficulty. In terms of the natural progression
   of USM, the results show significant differences between 7th grade and
   all grades above 10th, and between 8th grade and 12th grade. The
   students in the 7th grade intervention group performed better than the
   students in the 7th and 8th grades who received no special instruction
   on models.},

Abstract = {The present study examined whether gender, ethnicity, instructional
   medium and school category differences manifest in science performance
   and motivation to learn science among secondary school students in Sri
   Lanka. The mean of five successive term test scores was used as the
   measure of science performance. Level of motivation in terms of six
   dimensions was measured by using the Science Motivation Questionnaire. A
   sample of 1316 grade 11 students representing Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim
   ethnic groups from the three categories of public schools, which provide
   instructions in the vernacular languages of Sinhala or Tamil,
   participated in the study. Girls showed significantly higher performance
   in science compared to boys, and there was a significant gender
   difference in the levels of motivational dimensions in favor of girls.
   Although Tamil medium students possessed a higher level of motivation to
   learn science, Sinhala medium students outperformed their Tamil medium
   counterparts in science performance. Significant differences in science
   performance between Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim students were also
   observed. However, motivation towards learning science between Tamils
   and Muslims was not significantly different. Highly significant
   differences in both motivation to learn science and performance in
   science were found between three categories of schools. The present
   study provides information to education officials who have to achieve
   equity across gender, ethnicity, medium of instruction, and school
   category, teachers who deliver the subject and school principals who
   design academic support programs.},

Abstract = {In more and more countries, the goal of mathematics education is to
   develop students' mathematical competence beyond procedural and
   conceptual knowledge. Thus, students need to engage in a rich variety of
   tasks comprising competencies such as communication, reasoning and
   problem-solving. In addition, assessment tasks should be constructed to
   measure the particular aspects of mathematical competence to align
   assessment with curriculum. Teachers need to be able to recognise
   competency demand in the mathematical tasks they want to use for
   teaching and assessment purposes, which might prove difficult. The aim
   of this study was to analyse the outcome of 5 teachers' and prospective
   teachers' use of an item analysis tool. For each of 141 assessment
   tasks, the teachers and prospective teachers individually applied the
   tool to identify the competency demand of the task on a scale from 0 to
   3 for each of 6 mathematical competencies. Overall, the analysis reveals
   high consistency in their analysis. However, the teachers and
   prospective teachers utilised a restricted range of the scale, rarely
   judging a task to demand a high level of competence. This indicates that
   the 5 teachers and prospective teachers can use the tool to identify
   which of the 6 competencies are at play in solving a task, but can only
   differentiate to a limited extent between tasks that demand a low level
   of competence and those that demand a high level. In conclusion, we
   propose that an item analysis tool could be useful to teachers and
   prospective teachers as a means of analysing and selecting appropriate
   tasks that enhance development of mathematical competencies.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effectiveness of 3 curriculum interventions
   focused on strengthening children's ability to solve area measurement
   problems and explored the instructional perspectives of the instructor
   who implemented the interventions. The interventions involved various
   degrees of emphasis on area measurement and knowledge of 2-dimensional
   geometry. Participants were 131 fourth graders, recruited from a city in
   northern Taiwan, and 1 instructor. The results confirmed the
   effectiveness of an enriched curriculum integrating knowledge of
   2-dimensional geometry in enhancing children's conceptual understanding
   of area measurement. The group that received the enriched curriculum
   outperformed the other groups that received the curricula stressing only
   2-dimensional geometry or numerical calculations for area measurement in
   solving the area problems requiring mathematical judgments and
   explanations. The curriculum also facilitated children's reasoning in
   distinguishing between the perimeter and area of a rectangle, which
   required higher-order mathematical thinking. Interview data revealed
   that approximately all children from the 3 intervention groups could
   identify the mathematical subject-matter components highlighted in the
   curricula. Interviewees tended to consider the use of formulae to solve
   area measurement problems to be important, despite some differences in
   learning gains among the 3 groups. In interviews, the participating
   instructor revealed a change of perspective regarding the importance of
   offering students opportunities for manipulation and geometric
   operations when teaching area measurement, prompted by curriculum
   enactment.},

Abstract = {This study explored a modified version of Japanese Lesson Study to
   determine whether and how it influenced preservice elementary teachers
   in their abilities to deliver science lessons that included nature of
   science (NOS) to their own students. We used a case study approach that
   focused on one subset of a cohort of preservice elementary teachers
   within their field placement settings. Data sources included lesson
   plans, lesson feedback forms, videotapes of delivered lessons, and
   videotapes of lesson study feedback sessions. Early in the semester
   peers provided feedback on content, and later in the semester peers
   provided feedback on classroom management as well as content during the
   lesson study feedback sessions. We found that preservice elementary
   teachers were able to provide feedback to their peers regarding how to
   include NOS in their science lessons, yet did not naturally included NOS
   connections within their own lessons.},

Abstract = {The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies
   (PIAAC) has recently drawn additional attention to ``mathematical
   literacy{''} as an important influential factor for individuals' life
   chances. High levels of mathematical literacy have thereby been linked
   to using mathematics in daily and working life frequently. In this
   paper, based on the data from Germany, we focus on the construct ``use
   of mathematics{''} in two ways: First, we analyze in depth how it can be
   utilized to describe different groups of adults. Second, we investigate
   its role as predictor of mathematical competence and mediator of other
   relevant background variables. Results show that three groups of adults
   can be distinguished that use mathematics differently in daily and
   working life. However, the construct can sensibly be described as
   unidimensional. In a path model, ``use of mathematics{''} turns out to
   be the strongest predictor of mathematical competence. In addition, it
   mediates effects of the mathematical requirements of the job, duration
   of education, and gender.},
