Abstract = {Testing knowledge is an integral part of a summative assessment at
   schools. It can be performed in many different ways. In this study we
   propose assessment of physics knowledge by using a class tournament
   approach. Prior to a statistical analysis of the results obtained over a
   tournament organized in one of Polish high schools, all its specifics
   are discussed at length, including the types of questions assigned, as
   well as additional self- and peer-evaluation questionnaires,
   constituting an integral part of the tournament. The impact of the
   tournament upon student improvement is examined by confronting the
   results of a post-test with pre-tournament students' achievements
   reflected in scores earned in former, tests written by the students in
   experimental group and their colleagues from control group. We also
   present some of students' and teachers' feedback on the idea of a
   tournament as a tool of assessment. Both the analysis of the tournament
   results and the students' and teachers' opinions point to at least
   several benefits of our approach.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop and test a research model that
   investigates the factors influencing knowledge acquisition among adult
   workers participating in online informal learning activities. A total of
   342 adult workers, all of whom were civil servants working for the
   government in Taiwan, participated in this study. A survey instrument
   was used to assess their perceived abilities in information querying,
   information differentiation, online communication self-efficacy,
   information evaluation and extraction, and knowledge acquisition. A
   Structural Equation Modeling was performed using Partial Least Squares
   regression for data exploration and model estimation. The results of
   this study indicate that information querying, significantly affected
   the participants' information differentiation performance. The construct
   of information differentiation yielded a positive influence in the
   respondents' online communication self-efficacy and information
   evaluation and extraction. Moreover, information evaluation and
   extraction was found to be a significant predictor influencing adult
   workers' knowledge acquisition. The findings imply that organizations
   should consider including information literacy training in training
   initiatives and provide friendly online collaborating tools to enhance
   employees' online informal learning experiences.},

Abstract = {Intensive competition between educational organizations implies a shift
   in the perspective of studies aimed at investigating the creation of a
   favorable image of an educational organization from the external
   environment to the internal potential of higher educational institutions
   in the context of formation of optimal conditions for the training and
   occupational safety of employees and students. Therefore, the purpose of
   this study is to explore the system of occupational safety and training
   in Russian State Social University (RSSU) according to the following
   blocks: personnel, research and development, and infrastructure.
   Interviews, questionnaire surveys, and overt observations were used to
   determine the opinions of teachers (n=35) and students (n=140) in
   regards to the social and occupational phenomena related to the problem
   of creation of favorable labor and training conditions. The paper
   reveals the preferences of teachers and students in regards to the
   optimization of the RSSU image policy, formulates a strategic forecast
   of the optimization of training and occupational safety conditions, and
   gives recommendations regarding the creation of a favorable image of the
   RSSU.},

Abstract = {Because of the information asymmetry and risk uncertainty, export firms
   will learn to adjust export decisions from their peers. Based on the
   micro-matching data of China's customs export products and listed firms,
   this paper examines the peer effect of firms export activities by
   introducing equity shock as an exogenous variable. It is found that
   first, the values, scopes and number of destinations of exporters'
   products are positively influenced by their peer firms; second,
   exporters with lower product quality, growth capability and export
   intensity will follow those exporters with better export performances to
   change their behaviors. These asymmetric results prove that peer effect
   of firms' export behavior is in accordance with the law of logical
   imitation; third, CEOs with different demographic characteristics have
   great impact on the magnitude of export peer effect, showing that risk
   preferences and cognitive patterns of CEOs are significant for firms'
   export behavior.},

Abstract = {This research adopted the method of network data analysis, chose 31
   senior high school first-grade outstanding students as participants and
   44 concepts about trigonometric function as materials, analyzed the
   organization of mathematics knowledge in good mathematical cognitive
   structure (GMCS) with the help of software Ucinet. The results
   indicated: (1) The connections between the concepts in GMCS were more
   extensive, especially those connections with higher tightness degree.
   (2) Most connections in GMCS were direct. (3) There were more abstract
   concepts as accumulation points connecting with others. (4) There were a
   number of concrete and frequently used concepts connecting with others
   directly. Therefore, the mathematics teachers should help students to
   construct extensive and direct connections between mathematics knowledge
   in their mind. These new findings expanded and deepened the current
   research about mathematical cognitive structure(MCS), pointed out the
   direction and target for educators helping their students form GMCS.
   Meanwhile, this research demonstrated the network data analysis method
   was feasible and valuable to analyze mathematics psychological issues.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to find optimum angles for the orientation and
   the shading for buildings in the warm climatic regions. This study was
   conducted at Cyprus, which has Mediterranean climate. In the literature,
   many studies exist which consider only optimum orientation or only
   optimum shading. To this end, this study instead focuses on both optimum
   orientation and optimum shading and evaluates the results through
   experimental simulations. This research findings could be used to
   improve architecture students' skills about optimum orientation and
   optimum shading for buildings such as school buildings. Further, this
   study discusses the effective use of sunlight. Different building
   orientations were tested with a cube building model using the Ecotect
   simulation software. As a result, the minimum energy consumption area of
   the total annual energy use (heating and cooling) shows the optimum
   building orientation. Furthermore, the profile angle, which has the
   total minimum cooling consumption for the optimum building orientation,
   demonstrates the optimum shading element angle. In order to find the
   optimum orientation angle of the cube model, the building was oriented
   by incrementing 10 degrees azimuth angle (without shading elements) in
   the clockwise direction beginning from the north. As a result of the
   simulation of the cube model, the minimum energy consumption area was
   found at the azimuth 170 degrees, azimuth 180 degrees and azimuth 190
   degrees. For these orientations, simulations were conducted by
   incrementing a 1 degrees azimuth angle between 170 degrees and 190
   degrees. Based on the results of the optimum building orientation, the
   horizontal shading element was added to the window by incrementing the
   profile angle from 0 degrees to 40 degrees using 10 degrees step size.
   Then, an analysis was conducted by increasing 1 degrees angle for the
   estimated profile angles that show the minimum energy consumption. The
   simulation results for the cube model indicates that the optimum profile
   angle for the horizontal shading element is between 20 degrees and 30
   degrees. As a result, the optimum building orientation for the cube
   model was determined as azimuth 171 degrees (9 degrees towards east from
   the south) and 22 degrees for the optimum profile angle.},

Abstract = {This study aims to develop and understand the effect of a mobile game
   based learning (M-GBL) implementation on student learning outcomes
   associated with student learning independence. The research was
   conducted in three schools at 58 Jakarta High School, 77 Jakarta High
   School, and 78 Jakarta High School in the academic year 2016/2017. The
   research method used was quasi-experiment with two ways Anava research
   design (treatment by level 2x2). A total of 40 students, as a sample of
   the study, were selected using a simple random sampling technique. In
   the experimental class, the learning process used M-GBL media which has
   been validated by experts and tested against students and teachers.
   While students in the control class, the learning process used
   traditional media. The conclusions are: M-GBL media is feasible to be
   used as chemistry learning media which is practical, fun, interesting,
   can be used anywhere, and in accordance with facilities owned by
   learners. M-GBL media has a positive effect on students chemical
   learning outcomes when applied to groups of students who have high
   learning independence; in groups of students who have low learning
   independence, students' academic achievement when taught using M-GBL
   media were lower than students taught using traditional media owing to
   the factor of learning independence.},

Abstract = {Education regarding money and banking always tells us that banking is a
   critical point for macroeconomics. However, there is not enough evidence
   to further prove the relationship between banking and volatility. In our
   view, an integration of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with
   serious financing constraints, small open economy and bank-based
   financial system can provide the best opportunity to explore
   bank-volatility nexus. Fortunately, Taiwan is the most notable case to
   offer the key to an understanding of banking and volatility for our
   students of finance. There is sufficient evidence based on panel data
   analysis with spatial dependency to support the significance of regional
   bank lending (credit supply) rather than the stock market (credit
   demand) in explaining volatility. It is clear that the role of bank
   system in volatility in Taiwan deserves explicit emphasis.},

Abstract = {This study sought to explore the factors that help predict students'
   interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in
   Qatar. Drawing on recent work in the field, the present paper examines
   the intersection of personal characteristics (gender and grade level)
   and contextual (teacher) variables, and their association with interest
   in STEM. The study involved a nation-wide survey of preparatory and
   secondary levels of education in Qatar implemented in 2015, and data
   from a sample of 660 preparatory (middle) and secondary (high) school
   students. Factor analysis extracted five valid dimensions and a path
   analytic model suggested that student interest in STEM is influenced by
   teachers, perceptions of homework assignments, self-confidence and
   intention to pursue further study. Gender and level of education were
   also identified as variables likely to affect student interest in a STEM
   field. The paper concludes with important recommendations for policy and
   suggestions for further study and research.},

   faces a systemic refugee crises that affects minors as most vulnerable
   population. The research aimed to explore the above-mentioned
   dimensions, identify their stakeholders and tools, reveal the critical
   factors for their operation. The research methodology stood on the
   comparative approach, combined desk and field studies, included
   theoretical analysis of international white papers and academia
   contribution regarding refugee minors' protection against sexual
   violence. Special emphasis was laid to empirical analysis of the current
   state of affairs and promising practices of 40 countries that are member
   states to the Lanzarote Convention Committee of the Parties. The
   research results made it possible to outline major didactic dimensions
   for refugee minors' protection, identify key players and instruments for
   the above dimensions development, and to highlight promising practices
   in the area across various countries. The research significance is due
   to the confirmed efficiency of the developed methodology that allowed
   authors to explore current state of affairs and further trends to foster
   and enhance didactic dimensions of refugee minors' protection against

Abstract = {Drawing on social exchange theory, this study investigated the
   cross-level influence of high-performance work systems on organizational
   citizenship behavior, and verified the mediating role of psychological
   contract and the moderating effect of Chinese traditionality. With a
   sample of 51 enterprises and 1015 employees, results from cross-level
   analyses indicated that: (1) High-performance work systems had a
   significant positive impact on employees' organizational citizenship
   behavior. (2) High-performance work systems enhanced organizational
   citizenship behavior through the improvement of relational psychological
   contract and balanced psychological contract, at the same time, the
   high-performance work system could improve the organizational
   citizenship behavior by reducing transactional psychological contract.
   (3) Balanced psychological contract and relational psychological
   contract had a significant positive impact on organizational citizenship
   behavior, and the relationship with employee's organizational
   citizenship behavior was stronger for the balanced psychological
   contract, while transactional psychological contract had a significant
   negative impact on organizational citizenship behavior. (4) Chinese
   traditionality moderated the relationship between psychological
   contracts and employees' organizational citizenship behavior.},

Abstract = {The relevance of this study is determined by complete absence of serious
   research in the use of flipped learning model (FLM) in teaching students
   of engineering universities Descriptive Geometry, Engineering and
   Computer Graphics, Computer Geometry (DGECGCG); by the absence of
   scientifically-based, tried and tested programs and teaching materials
   for flipped DGECGCG learning; as well as by the need for the development
   of new, modern tools to support classroom work and forms of students'
   individual work. The purpose of the study is to examine the current
   state of knowledge and practice of existing DGECGCG courses, using the
   ``flipped{''} concept as the main pedagogical strategy. Research methods
   of the issues were: pedagogical experiment, expert assessment
   (individual and collective) and cluster analysis (Euclidean distance,
   squared Euclidean distance, Ward's clustering methods). The experiment
   involved 25 first-year students of Electromechanical and Mining
   faculties and 4 lecturers of the Department of Descriptive Geometry and
   Graphics of the Saint Petersburg Mining University. The results showed
   that since 2012, flipped learning has gained popularity not only among
   school teachers, but among professors of engineering universities. This
   article represents a synthesis of qualitative and quantitative
   researches of flipped learning models in the field of engineering
   education; students' attitude towards flipped learning, the role of
   teaching materials as well as the role of professor's personality have
   been identified. Advantages and disadvantages of this learning model
   have been revealed. The study proved the absence of scientifically-based
   and tried and tested programs and instructional materials for teaching
   students DGECGCG using FLM. The need of further scientific researches of
   flipped DGECGCG learning models has been identified. Recommendations for
   training students have been provided. The materials of the article can
   be useful for Professors in the field of engineering.},

Abstract = {The article is aimed at describing one of the possible interdisciplinary
   courses for students of the 7-9 classes of the basic school connecting
   mathematics with natural sciences and the study of such courses role in
   the formation and development of meta-subject competencies of students.
   The leading method for this is the modeling of interdisciplinary
   courses, the main tools for the development of meta-subject competence
   in which are the interdisciplinary character of the content, including
   open and partially open type tasks in the course structure and the
   organization of project activities of schoolchildren in the field of
   studying mathematics and related disciplines. As a result of the
   research conducted by the authors they worked out several author's
   interdisciplinary courses, among them a special place is taken by the
   course ``Mathematics in Natural sciences{''} for the classes of the
   natural-science profile. It is suggested in it to consider mathematical
   questions when applying them to the material of related disciplines both
   through the study of theoretical material and in the process of solving
   problems, including the open type, and involving schoolchildren in the
   project of interdisciplinary activity. Practical use of the
   interdisciplinary courses allows to see the achievements of meta-subject
   results by schoolchildren and the successes of students both in
   mathematical preparation, expressed by high marks on the subject, and
   related disciplines, which indicates the improvement of mathematical
   education quality of students who received training using the proposed
   methodology.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify the effects of GeoGebra software
   on students' conceptual and procedural knowledge and the achievement of
   Form Two students in Mathematics particularly on the topic Function. In
   addition, this study determined the role of procedural knowledge as a
   mediator between conceptual knowledge and students' achievement. This
   study employed a quasi-experiment approach on 345 students divided into
   two groups. A group with 169 students used the GeoGebra software, while
   another 176 students used the conventional method to learn Mathematics.
   The data were collected through conceptual and procedural tests, and
   from students' achievement in the topic Function of the Mathematic
   examination. The data were analysed using the SPSS 22.0, AMOS 18.0 and
   ANATES v4 software. Findings of the study show that students who used
   GeoGebra to learn Mathematics have higher mathematical conceptual and
   procedural knowledge compared to those who learnt Mathematics through
   the conventional methods. Both experiment groups show that procedural
   knowledge is a significant mediator between conceptual knowledge and
   students' achievement in Mathematics. In conclution, GeoGebra software
   is capable of enhancing students' conceptual and procedural knowledge,
   which at the same time significantly improves students' achievement.},

Abstract = {Engineering Graphics and Design (EGD) is a university course that
   teaches a medium of communication in the form of drawings. This study
   was undertaken to investigate factors associated with the difficulties
   experienced by student teachers in the sectional drawing component of
   the EGD course. Purposive sampling was used to select 40 students
   enrolled for the Bachelor of Education: Technical Education studying
   EGD. Questionnaires, classroom observations and focus interview were
   used to collect data. The results of this study reveal that students
   have a poor EGD background; experience difficulties in understanding
   sectional drawing; lack understanding of sectional drawing principles;
   lack knowledge of 2D/3D sectional drawing as well as poor pedagogic
   practices. It has also transpired that students perform poorly in the
   spatial visualization test. It is recommended that more attention be
   paid to line-work and spatial visualization exercises during teaching,
   using Piaget's perception of imagery theories. Specific subject
   didactics of technology subjects should be strengthened with these
   topics in order to prepare efficient and quality teachers of EGD and
   related subjects.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between prospective secondary
   mathematics teachers' perspectives and their mathematical knowledge for
   teaching in action. Data from two prospective teachers'
   practice-teachings, one in geometry and one in algebra, their lesson
   plans and self-reflections were analyzed with Teacher Perspectives and
   Knowledge Quartet frameworks. Results showed that prospective teachers
   who thought of mathematics and mathematics learning as dependent on the
   knower, corresponding with a progressive incorporation perspective, had
   demonstrated all the codes in Knowledge Quartet Framework. These results
   suggest that, once prospective teachers are given opportunities to
   develop a progressive incorporation perspective on mathematics,
   mathematics learning, and mathematics teaching during methods and
   practice teaching courses, this might conrtibute to the developments in
   their mathematical knowledge for teaching in action, independent of the
   particular concept they teach. Suggestions for developing a progressive
   incorporation perspective during methods and practice teaching courses
   are given.},

Abstract = {We conducted a qualitative research of case studies based on think-aloud
   protocols. The aim was to carry out in-depth analyse secondary students'
   cognitive difficulties appearing in early stages of transfer processes
   in problem-solving. The task was to relate several source problems to a
   target problem, in order to solve it effectively. Source and target
   problems had different Surface and/or Structural similarities. In this
   paper, the solvers' high or low Familiarity with the problem stories on
   transfer processes was also focused on. Two emergent instructional
   phenomena are described, both associated to specific students' cognitive
   obstacles to achieve success in solving the target problem: the `Screen
   effect' and the `Sisyphus effect'. The obstacles were harder for low
   Familiarity problems.},

   analysis. Three teachers. categories (Good, Middle, and Low) were
   established by cluster analysis methodology. The most teachers.
   challenge on MCK was figural representation. For MPCK, Indonesian
   teachers need more opportunity to learn the factor of Knowing students

Abstract = {There have been various studies about interaction, structure, social
   presence and satisfaction in online learning; however, there is not any
   research which represents the relationships among these concepts. The
   purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship among these
   variables. The population of the study is involved 205 university
   students who enrolled bachelor degree completion program at the Ankara
   University. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypothesizes.
   The results of this study indicated that there is a negative correlation
   between the course structure and interaction dimensions defined by Moore
   in transactional distance theory. Secondly, online students. social
   presence was predicted positively by interaction and negatively by
   course structure. Furthermore, online learning satisfaction was
   predicted positively by social presence. Students are most satisfied
   when their social presences are high in the online learning.},

Abstract = {This article seeks to present findings from the analysis of the TEDS-M
   reports on the mathematical content knowledge (MCK) and pedagogical
   content knowledge (PCK) of the pre-service teachers in Malaysia. The
   main objective of this study was to investigate the level of teaching
   knowledge attained by the Malaysian pre-service primary and secondary
   teachers. Some 576 primary level pre-service teachers and 389 secondary
   level pre-service teachers participated in the TEDS-M study. The
   significance of this study is pertinent as the level of teachers'
   knowledge influences students' achievement in schools. Results of
   analysis show that Malaysian pre-service teachers at the primary and
   secondary performed below the international average for both mathematics
   content knowledge (MCK) and mathematics pedagogical content knowledge
   (MPCK). The article suggested several steps on how teacher educators
   could improve the PCK and MCK of pre-service teachers in Malaysia.},

Abstract = {The year 2014 marks the end of the United Nations Decade of Education
   for Sustainable Development (ESD). All educational domains and levels,
   including primary and secondary science education, have been working to
   contribute to education enabling younger generations to become
   responsible citizens and promote sustainable development in our world.
   This paper gives insights into some theoretical foundations of the UN
   Decade for ESD. Different models of implementing ESD in the teaching of
   science and technology are presented and illustrated by various case
   studies, which were developed by the University of Bremen chemistry
   education group. These examples and the corresponding evaluation case
   studies show that thoroughly combining the ESD framework with science
   teaching that follows a socio-scientific issues-based approach to
   education has great potential for helping students develop many general
   educational skills. It also opens a path to a more balanced view of
   science in its societal and professional context. This allows career
   orientation both in and beyond science and engineering.},

Abstract = {This study has led to the development of the `Bioethical Values
   Inventory' that can be used to reveal secondary school students' ethical
   values in decisions that they make during ethical debates regarding the
   application of biological sciences. An original inventory development
   model was used, consisting of four steps and involving qualitative as
   well as quantitative data collection processes in line with the
   objectives of the study. In the first step of this model an analysis of
   ethical debates on biological sciences was followed by the statement of
   the inventory topics. In the second step, scenarios were created on the
   ethical dilemmas related to each chosen topic. In the third step, these
   scenarios were applied to ninth graders (n = 493) in 18 secondary
   schools in eight districts of Ankara, Turkey. The students' responses to
   the scenarios were revealed through content analysis strategies and the
   inventory was converted into a multiple-choice questionnaire through
   thematic coding. In the fourth step, the inventory was finalized by
   gathering experts' and students' views on the multiple-choice items. The
   final version of the inventory and its importance for science/bioethics
   education is discussed in the light of the relevant literature.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to present changes, if any exist, in early
   childhood teacher candidates' mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs
   (MTEB) after the implementation of a play-generated curriculum approach.
   This experimental one-group pretest-posttest design utilized qualitative
   data through an open-ended questionnaire conducted at the end of the
   instruction. Thirty-seven second-year college students from the Early
   Childhood Education department at Mersin University participated in the
   study. Among the instruments used during the study were a questionnaire
   for the participants' demographics, a Turkish version of MTEBI for
   teacher candidates, an open-ended questionnaire focusing on the
   difficulties confronted by teacher candidates during the preparation and
   implementation of a lesson plan utilizing the play-generated curriculum
   approach and lesson observation form. The results indicate that early
   childhood education teacher candidates' mathematics teaching efficacy
   beliefs when combined with their personal mathematics teaching and
   outcome expectancy beliefs possessed a positive and statistically
   significant change after they prepared play-based instruction.},

Abstract = {This poem likens learning mathematics to a boy who proposes love to a
   girl. In the African culture, there are certain qualities of a girl that
   are considered when she is ripe for being proposed to: outside physical
   appearance, hardworking capability and beauty as well as inner qualities
   such as intelligence, good morals, faithfulness, loving and feeling for
   others. However, there are challenges and obstacles encountered when the
   boy proposes love. In this poem, the `learner' of mathematics is the
   `boy' whereas the `girl' is mathematics itself. Suggestions for dealing
   with the challenges and obstacles are hereby given. This poem can be
   dramatized or acted by teachers and their learners in the mathematics
   classroom situation, or can be used as a motivational teaching strategy
   by mathematics teachers or college lecturers.},

Abstract = {Being affected by the rapid change in internal and external environments
   in past years, the fiercer competition has resulted in the declination
   of toy industry. For the sustained-yield management, toy manufacturers
   have been searching for strategies. In the consumer-oriented era, an
   enterprise has to precede statistics education of toy designers so that
   the market survey could accurately analyze consumer needs to establish
   differential products for creating product value and meeting consumer
   needs. The supervisors, employees, and customers of Traxxas are the
   major research subjects for the questionnaire survey in this study.
   Total 300 copies of questionnaire are distributed and 236 valid copies
   are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 79\%. The research results reveal
   significantly positive correlations between 1.product design and
   purchase intention, 2.statistics education and product design, and
   3.statistics education and purchase intention. According to the results,
   suggestions are proposed, expecting to assist domestic toy manufacturers
   in the future development of product design for the sustained-yield
   management.},

Abstract = {Examination of depressive tendencies among university students studying
   in North Cyprus in terms of factors as gender, class, economic status
   and satisfaction level from current social connections were aimed.
   Automatic Thoughts Scale (ATQ) was used to measure depressive
   tendencies. Participants were reached according to availability
   principle. Participants are 171 volunteered university students whose
   origin country is Turkey and studying in various universities at North
   Cyprus (85 females; 87 freshmen-84 senior; age range 18-30, (X) over bar
   age=21.25, SD=2.99). According to variance analysis, freshmen students
   differed with significantly higher mean scores regarding total ATQ
   scores, `confusion and escape fantasies', `loneliness/isolation' and
   `giving up/helplessness' subscales of ATQ. Males differed with
   significantly higher loneliness/isolation scores than females.
   Statistically significant depressive tendency differences in terms of
   ATQ total and all subscales among different economic levels were
   determined. The students who `unsatisfied' with their current social
   connections differed with significantly higher depressive tendencies
   from students who are `satisfied'.},

Abstract = {This study is specifically designed to measure the effectiveness of
   Contextual Teaching and Learning (CTL) on the students' scientific
   attitude and achievement in Natural Science among Junior school students
   in Pekanbaru, Indonesia. This quasi experiment involved some 215 Form
   VII students from three public schools, segregated based on their
   existing cognitive abilities. The CTL materials was developed by
   applying RANGKA strategy. Overall, the findings revealed that there is
   significant difference exist across experimental groups in terms of
   students' achievement. However, there is no significant difference in
   terms of scientific attitude. These findings contribute significant
   implications for the enhancement of scientific thinking skills among
   various students' capabilities and different categories of school.
   Contextual teaching strategy is found appropriate in achieving the above
   dimensions in heterogeneous schools. This is due to the fact that the
   RANGKA contextual learning strategy as developed in this study focuses
   on the right way for students to learn.},

Abstract = {This paper uses the downside realized semi variance to measure the
   downside risk and then the HAR-DR, HAR-DR-V and HAR-DR-DV models on the
   basis of the HAR-RV model are built. Finally, by comparing the three
   models' prediction ability for downside risk in the stock spot market
   and futures market, we test whether the trading volume and downside
   trading volume of the two markets can be used to predict the downside
   risk. And we also study the differences under different samples and
   different models. The results indicate that trading volume and downside
   trading volume have different prediction effects for the downside risk
   in different periods. The trading volume and downside trading volume
   exhibit much forecasting power in the futures market. However, they show
   little forecasting power in the spot market.},

Abstract = {China's mass entrepreneurship and innovation policy have inspired many
   individuals to join incumbent agglomerations to supplement their
   resource insufficiency. Based on the ties of kinship and township
   relations among a typical agglomeration, this paper explored the
   individuals' preferential attachment rules and analyzes the network
   properties. The main findings included: self-employment agglomeration
   with given preferential attachment rules has a large average degree;
   this kind of network is scale-free, and it follows power-law degree
   distribution; clustering coefficient is very large; the average path
   length is short and it follows a power-law distribution. Our findings
   demonstrated that this typical self-employment agglomeration is a kind
   of complex network. We also discussed the mechanism of complex network's
   advantages on self-employment activities.},

Abstract = {The main focus of this paper is to investigate intuitionistic linguistic
   information fusion based on Heronian mean. Two new intuitionistic
   linguistic aggregation operators called intuitionistic linguistic
   generalized Heronian mean (ILGHM) and intuitionistic linguistic
   generalized weighted Heronian mean (ILGWHM) operators, are introduced.
   The ILGHM and ILGWHM operators are characterized by the ability to deal
   with the intuitionistic linguistic multiple attribute decision making
   problems in which the attributes are interactive. Some desired
   properties and special cases with respect to the different parameter
   values in the developed operators are studied. Furthermore, a method
   based on the proposed operators is developed to deal with multiple
   attribute group decision making (MAGDM) method problems. Finally, an
   illustrative example concerning evaluation of scientific research
   capacity is provided to illustrate the decision-making process and to
   discuss the influences of different parameters on the decision-making
   results.},

Abstract = {Good interaction between the teacher and students in class is crucial
   for giving a good lesson. Only the teacher and students could well
   interact with each other than teaching quality could be better promoted.
   In this paper, literature consultation, mathematical analysis,
   questionnaire survey etc. are applied to study on teacher-student
   interactive behaviors in sports class at Chengdu municipal experimental
   primary school. Results indicated that there are four types of
   teacher-student interaction at Chengdu municipal experimental primary
   school, from which group interaction between the teacher and students
   were most frequent. Investigation finds that problems in interaction of
   the school were formalized class, ineffectiveness and unequal
   interaction. Whereas main influence factors of interactive behaviors
   cover teacher factor, student factor, teaching contents, teaching media,
   teaching environment etc., from which teach factor is the main part.
   Moreover, it acquired some promotion strategies to improve present
   situation that provided evidence for better interaction between the
   teacher and students in sports class.},

Abstract = {Studies show that students, within the context of mathematics and
   science, have difficulties understanding the concepts of the derivative
   as the slope and the concept of the antiderivative as the area under the
   curve. In this article, we present the Test of Understanding Graphs in
   Calculus (TUG-C), an assessment tool that will help to evaluate
   students' understanding of these two concepts by a graphical
   representation. Data from 144 students of introductory courses of
   physics and mathematics at a university was collected and analyzed. To
   evaluate the reliability and discriminatory power of this test, we used
   statistical techniques for individual items and the test as a whole, and
   proved that the test's results are satisfactory within the standard
   requirements. We present the design process in this paper and the test
   in the appendix. We discuss the findings of our research, students'
   understanding of the relations between these two concepts, using this
   new multiple-choice test. Finally, we outline specific recommendations.
   The analysis and recommendations can be used by mathematics or science
   education researchers, and by teachers that teach these concepts.},

Abstract = {It is a common sense in the field of world educational theory that the
   development of higher education is promoted and the participation of
   talents into practice of training for technical education is encouraged.
   All countries have taken active measures to encourage and promote the
   development of higher education in their own countries. With deepening
   of reform and opening up, talent shortage has become the bottleneck of
   social and economic development in China's higher education. In order to
   meet the needs of professional and technical talents in economic
   development, China's vocational higher education has established the
   goal of training talents to meet the needs of social and economic
   development. In educational practice, talent training is related to job
   gap in social technology. Under the guidance of this goal, the batch of
   market-oriented training model for qualified personnel has become the
   mainstream. As a result, China's higher educational system can alleviate
   the ``thirst for talent{''} in the market and provide a strong support
   for sustained and healthy development of economy. The mode of Chinese
   higher educational system and ``dual system{''} of British educational
   model constitute a different form of personnel training. The UK higher
   education pays more attention to ability training, which has significant
   tendency. It is beneficial to individual development, while Chinese
   higher educational system supported by university system will not only
   offer the talents systematic knowledge, but also timely adjust the
   teaching content according to the change of market demand and enhance
   the social applicability of higher education. In the reform of
   optimizing Chinese higher educational system, we should actively refer
   to experiences of higher education in Britain to build higher
   educational system with Chinese characteristics: strengthening basic
   construction of law system and top-level construction of vocational
   education; carrying out quality certification and encouraging
   enterprises to participate in practice of vocational education system;
   regulating the connotative construction of contents and model in higher
   education to improve the quality of vocational education.},

Abstract = {Compared with traditional learning methods, Educational virtual
   community has the incomparable advantage of knowledge diffusion with
   high efficiency and wide range. It is conductive to the knowledge
   acquisition and innovation of learners, and it provides a platform for
   learners to change their roles from the passive recipient of information
   to the main participant of knowledge acquisition. Based on the
   interactions between users' personal, technical and organizational
   characteristics, a modified technology acceptance model was presented in
   this paper to explain the willingness and behavior of knowledge sharing
   in EVC in order to propose and validate the effects of perceived
   usefulness, perceived ease of use, and psychological ownership on the
   willingness and behavior of knowledge sharing. In this research, the
   methods of interviewing and questionnaires with 40 questions included
   have adopted and 334 members from 32 educational virtual communities
   were surveyed. Based on the 326 valid samples, the hypothesis of
   research be tested with software SPSS 22.0 by structural equation model.
   Empirical research found that: Perceived usefulness and perceived ease
   of use has remarkable positive impact on knowledge sharing willingness,
   and perceived usefulness with greater function can significantly promote
   perceived ease of use; psychological ownership can affect not only the
   knowledge sharing behavior through the knowledge sharing willingness,
   but also the behavior directly; the knowledge sharing willingness plays
   a fully mediating role between perceived usefulness and knowledge
   sharing behavior, while there exist the significant mediating effects
   between perceived ease of use and knowledge sharing behavior, and
   between psychological ownership and knowledge sharing behavior. Based on
   the conclusion of this research, the interactions between different
   factors should be taken into account in order to advance the willingness
   and behavior of knowledge sharing among EVC members and the perceived
   usefulness, perceived ease of use and psychological ownership level of
   community members should be proactively promoted.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the issue covered in the paper is substantiated by the
   need to form secondary university teachers' readiness and abilities to
   work with university students with limited health opportunities. The
   paper provides the research results and experience of psychological
   skills formation in university teachers as part of their professional
   competency in issues of inclusive education environment arrangement. The
   main research method is pedagogic experiment (stating, forming and
   control) aimed to reflect quality characteristics and dynamics of
   teachers' psychological readiness to work in inclusive education
   environment. The paper suggests empirical data to determine factors that

Abstract = {The purpose of the research is to build a methodological system for
   teaching stochastics to university students of the Biology
   specialization in the context of implementing a professional-applied
   orientation. The leading method of researching this aspect is the
   modeling of the conceptual basis of the methodological system for
   teaching stochastics, which allows to form a system of mathematical
   knowledge and skills necessary for understanding the fundamentals of the
   process of mathematical modeling and statistical processing of
   biological data in professional activity; to develop practical
   application skills of statistical methods in biological research. In
   this article, the authors' methodology of forming professional
   competence of future specialists of the Biology specialization through
   the implementation of professionally-applied teaching stochastics is
   presented. The specificity of our methodology for teaching stochastics
   to university students of the Biology specialization is that between the
   theoretical and practical aspects of stochastics, a deep
   content-methodological interrelationship has been established; the
   authors' system of professionally-applied tasks has been proposed, which
   includes, among other things, real tasks from the discipline of Biology
   that facilitates the integration of natural science knowledge based on
   the modeling method. The research carried out by the authors proved the
   effectiveness of the suggested methodology for teaching stochastics to
   university students of the Biology specialization. The article materials
   can be useful for lecturers of higher educational institutions and
   teachers of secondary schools with in-depth Biology studying when the
   suggested methodology for teaching the probability theory and
   mathematical statistics is applied.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the efficiency level of digital
   teaching materials for higher education programs. The present study had
   a mixed research methodology to gather in-depth and rich context. Twenty
   participants were chosen from a distance education program of the
   Pedagogical Formation (2014-2015) at Near East University in Nicosia in
   North Cyprus. The sample of the present study was selected by using the
   purposeful sampling method. The participants who took the course
   (instructional technology and material design), half of them used
   electronic sources and the other half used traditional sources during
   the distance education. The participants' answers were categorized into
   who was taking distance education with digital materials and who was
   taking distance education with non-digital materials. The results
   indicate that the participants were aware of the facilities of using
   e-books and they were content with the facilities of using an electronic
   book. The participants' view show that using electronic book has
   function on being successful and interactive in their education. At the
   same time, using electronic book provide chances to students reach
   multiple sources. Thus, the participants' answers in qualitative data
   also indicate that using multimedia is necessity to increase level of
   motivation students in their study and using electronic book and
   electronic sources provide unlimited learning platforms for students.
   Thus, students' level of attention and permanent learning are increased.},

   become an essential way of learning in 21st century. Taking translation
   course as a case study, this research constructed a system of ubiquitous
   learning modes based on network and analyzed the teaching experimental
   results qualitatively and quantitatively. It is proved that construction
   of curriculum in the network will be a new teaching idea, which will
   bring more optimized, more real-time, more targeted results to teaching.},

Abstract = {Contemporary toy is characterized by accelerating social, cultural and
   technological change. An attractive action figure can grab consumers'
   attention, influence the latent consuming preference and evoke their
   pleasure. However, traditional design of action figure is always
   dependant on designer's opinion, subjective experience and preference.
   It could be a selling risk in the marketing in terms of new action
   figure. Therefore, how to objectively extract the appeal information of
   action figure is an important topic for aiding designers to develop an
   action figure of satisfying consumers. This study explores the task of
   action figure appeal to consumer psychological perception. A series of
   investigation is conducted to collect the action figure appeals
   including the abstract psychological perceptions and concrete
   factor/feature descriptions by means of the existing action figures
   based on the procedure of Evaluation Grid Method. Then, the
   Quantification Theory Type I is used to establish the relationship
   between the abstract consumer psychological perceptions and the concrete
   action figure appeal factors. The results show that the action figure
   appeals can be objectively and systematically extracted, and provide
   designers with useful design information to develop a particular action
   figure for satisfying consumers.},

Title = {Suggesting a NOS Map for Nature of Science for Science Education
   Instruction},
Journal = {EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1461-1483},

Abstract = {The aims of this research are 1) to explore the inter-relationships
   within the individual elements or tenets of Nature of Science (NOS),
   based on the dimensions of scientific knowledge in science learning, and
   2) to consider Kuhn's concept of how scientific revolution takes place.
   This study suggests that instruction according to our NOS Flowchart
   should include the tenets of NOS. The aspects of NOS that have been
   emphasized in recent science education reform documents disagree with
   the received views of common science. Attitudes about science can have a
   significant effect on scientific literacy. In education theory, the
   understanding of content lies in the cognitive domain, whereas attitudes
   lie in the affective domain. There are three major dimensions of
   learning in science: knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Additionally, it
   is valuable to introduce students at the primary level to some of the
   ideas developed by Kuhn. Key aspects of NOS are, in fact, good
   applications to the history of science through Kuhn's philosophy.
   Therefore, an NOS Flow Map could be a promising means of understanding
   the NOS tenets and an explicit and reflective tool for science teachers
   to enhance scientific teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present a professional development course designed to
   impact on teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching fractions. The
   main features of the course are the use of i) problem solving activities
   related with mathematical knowledge for teaching fractions ii) peer
   discussions and iii) monitor's interventions focused on answering with
   questions. The objective of this paper is to present some insights on
   how this type of course may contribute to the development of teachers'
   knowledge for teaching fractions. To do that we analyze in depth the
   case of one teacher, using the recording of his work during the course
   (video, audio, and written documents), his answers to two questionnaires
   and his responses to an interview six months after the course. Results
   show how the course's features contributed to the development of this
   teacher's specific fractions knowledge, knowledge of fractions and
   students, and of fractions and teaching.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates how prospective teachers develop mathematical
   models while they engage in modeling tasks. The study was conducted in
   an undergraduate elective course aiming to improve prospective teachers'
   mathematical modeling abilities, while enhancing their pedagogical
   knowledge for the integrating of modeling tasks into their future
   classroom practices. The participants of this study were six prospective
   teachers selected among the nineteen who enrolled in the course. Data
   was collected through five modeling tasks. The results showed that the
   prospective teachers went through five main stages during the modeling
   process: understanding the task, devising a solution plan, working out
   the plan, interpreting and verifying the model, and presenting the
   model. The nature of prospective teachers' modeling processes was rather
   result-oriented, consisting of a single cycle as they did not seek an
   improved solution by revising and refining their models.},

Abstract = {With the advance of mobile computing and wireless technology, a user's
   intent to interact with the interface of a mobile device is motivated
   not only by its intuitional operation, but also by the emotional
   perception induced by its aesthetic appeal. A graphical interface
   employing icons with suitable visual effect based on the users'
   emotional perception plays an essential role in determining the
   possibility of users' interaction with an interface of mobile device.
   This study commences to develop an integrated design approach based on
   Conjoint Analysis and TOPSIS Algorithm to the visual effect of icon
   design. The ``Facetime App{''} icon is chosen for illustration purposes.
   A series of evaluation trials are then performed to establish the
   correlation between the icon visual effects and the users' image
   perceptions of the icon. The integrated design approach can assist
   designers obtain effective information to develop the icon candidates of
   various visual effects so as to match the demands of multiple users'
   image perceptions. Although this study takes just the ``Facetime App{''}
   icon as an example for illustration purposes, the integrated design
   approach is equally applicable to various types of icons shown on the
   interface of mobile device.},

Abstract = {When we administered the Test of Understanding of Vectors (TUV) to
   students who were completing a physics university remedial course (which
   covers subjects of a traditional high school physics course), we
   observed that they had considerable difficulties in interpreting the dot
   product as a projection. As a result of this, we decided to design a
   tutorial worksheet to guide students through the development of this
   skill. The worksheet was implemented with 288 students of the same
   course in another semester. Upon using the TUV to evaluate the students'
   understanding, we confirmed that the tutorial worksheet facilitated
   their learning. This tutorial worksheet is presented in the Appendix and
   might be used by other physics instructors teaching this material in
   high schools, colleges or universities.},

Abstract = {This study aims to determine the effect on the achievement, motivation
   and self-sufficiency of students of the flipped classroom approach
   adapted to Keller's ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence and
   Satisfaction) motivation model and applied to a physics course. The
   study involved 66 students divided into two classes of a physics course.
   The first class used the traditional lecture format while the flipped
   classroom model was used in the second. The research data were obtained
   via the physics concept test, motivation questionnaire, physics
   self-sufficiency scale and semi-structured interviews. It was found that
   the experimental group students were achieve more than the students in
   the control group. An increase in motivation and self-sufficiency of the
   students in the experimental group was identified as well. Thereafter,
   semi-structured interviews were carried out with students of the
   experimental group. It was found that they had positive opinions
   regarding the flipped classroom approach.},

Abstract = {The difficulty of Virtual Reality application in industrial design
   education and learning is VR engineers cannot comprehend what the
   important functions or elements are for students. In addition, a
   general-purpose VR usually confuses the students and provides neither
   good manipulation means nor useful toolkits. To solve these problems,
   the ZMET-QFD model presented in this paper, can translate the in-depth
   demands of VR into actual functions from the students' thoughts. With a
   ZMET-QFD model, twenty-one items are determined to be the functions for
   VR from the students' perspective. According to importance ranking, top
   ten items are: real-world parameters, physical database, multiple
   viewpoints, multiple-windows operation, ruler and unit display,
   environmental database, material database, multiple presentation models,
   graphical interface, and customized parameters. The findings of this
   study should lead to the creation of a concept of a designer-oriented
   virtual reality system that can truly help industrial design education
   and students' learning.},

Abstract = {Visual cognitive style is an individual difference that is related to
   the preference or visual imagery tendency of an individual of processing
   visual information. This study examines the visual cognitive styles of
   university students according to their study subject, study year and
   genders and includes 448 first-and third-year university students from
   seven departments. The results indicate that spatial imagery tendencies
   were stronger among students in the sciences, whereas verbal tendencies
   were strong among students in linguistic fields. The spatial imagery
   tendencies of third-year students from the Department of Physics
   Engineering and the verbal tendencies of third-year students from the
   Department of English Language Teaching were significantly higher than
   those of first-year students of related departments. Different from
   previous studies the finding about the tendency increment among first to
   third year of study is remarkable which can be investigated through
   experimental studies.},

Abstract = {Many institutions monitor academic engagement to investigate student
   achievement and institutional performance. Relying only on self-reports
   is prone to misjudgment. Peer evaluation through teamwork has the
   potential to substitute for measuring engagement, which has not been
   emphasized in the literature. This study examines whether peer
   evaluation can represent perceived academic engagement with coursework,
   operationalized as ``active learning{''} and ``paying attention.{''}
   Data were collected through an online peer evaluation system.
   Participants were 215 undergraduate and graduate students from three
   universities. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test
   hypotheses. Results show that peer evaluation is statistically
   predictive of perceived academic engagement. Peers give high scores to
   their counterparts conforming to the literature. Students are more
   engaged than overall benchmarks. Results suggest that creating more
   opportunities for teamwork in the educational environment and efficient
   ways to incorporate peer evaluation through means such as social
   networks and online learning management systems are viable venues for
   improvement.},

Abstract = {One important function of school mathematics curriculum is to prepare
   high school students with the knowledge and skills needed for university
   education. Identifying them empirically will help making sound decisions
   about the contents of high school mathematics curriculum. It will also
   help students to make informed choices in course selection at high
   school. In this study, we surveyed university faculty members who teach
   first year university students about the mathematical knowledge and
   skills that they would like to see in incoming high school graduates.
   Data were collected from 122 faculty members from social science
   (history, law, psychology) and engineering departments
   (electrical/electronics and computer engineering). Participants were
   asked to indicate which high school mathematics topics and skills they
   thought were important to be successful at university education in their
   field. Results were compared across social science and engineering
   departments. Implications were drawn for curriculum specialists,
   students, and mathematics educators.},

Abstract = {One of the most important characteristics of period we live is change
   and transformation. Technology is one of the factors effecting this
   change. A new technological product or an advanced model of technology
   influences people. s lives. While technology leaves an impression on
   life in the past, this effect becomes in a very quickly way compared to
   today. Therefore, most people have witnessed a great number of
   transformations in the recent period. In this study, changes caused by
   technology on our lives have been reviewed with the eye of teacher
   candidates. 35 teacher candidates whose ages change between 19-23 were
   participated in this study supported by qualitative methods.
   Transformations resulting from technology witnessed by them during all
   their lives are given as a finding from the perspective of participants.
   We have made use of open ended question form as a data collection mean
   in this study. As a result of examination of data gained through content
   analysis, accessibility to information in the field of education,
   increasing of quality in the education, becoming important of visual
   learning, in particular using of new technologies with the purposes of
   communication in family and negative aspects of new technologies,
   gaining speed of communication in the communication, coming into our
   life of new technologies such as 3G via internet and decreasing of
   social communication have become prominent transformations in the recent
   times. On the other hand, it has been stated that transportation,
   entertainment, health, automobile industry, public enterprises and
   agriculture sector are fields affected too much from technology-oriented
   transformations subsequent to education, family and communication.},

Abstract = {The integration of decision-making competence or comparable constructs
   into science education has been strongly enforced during the last twenty
   years. Germany captured the tendency with the introduction of national
   standards for science education that included a domain that refers to
   decision-making competence. This domain - `evaluation and judgement
   competence' - is currently depicted by different models. This paper
   describes the models and existing international approaches on
   decision-making. To give insights into current research on the German
   construct, selected results of two studies regarding teachers'
   pedagogical content knowledge with the focus on improving the
   integration of evaluation and judgement competence into biology lessons
   are presented. Relations of evaluation and judgement competence to
   international approaches and its integration into biology lessons are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of a learning
   activity based on Science Fiction (SF) film (movie) on the technological
   creativity of middle school students. A quasi-experimental design was
   employed, and 132 middle school students were included in this study.
   The following conclusions were reached based on the data analysis: 1) SF
   film can stimulate middle school students' technological creativity. 2)
   Appropriate hands-on learning activities designed on the basis of
   students' learning styles are effective for stimulating students'
   technological creativity.},

Abstract = {The current study aims to design a proposal based on social networks to
   develop the competencies of active citizenship among middle and high
   school students. The descriptive and analytical method as well as a
   questionnaire utilized to achieve the study objectives. The sample
   consisted of (207) middle and high school students from Schools of
   Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University for Educational Development.
   The results showed that the extent of using social media networks among
   the participants was medium, and the most common social media used by
   middle students were YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat, respectively.
   There were no statistically significant differences between middle and
   high school students for the extent of their use of social media
   networks. A list of required active citizenship competencies (cognitive,
   skill, and emotional) made and a proposal for their development
   designed. It consists of ``objectives, general principles for the
   proposal, content, and team work, and the adopted educational activities
   and techniques. The study recommends paying more attention to the social
   media networks favorite by students, and benefiting from them when
   planning for educational programs and enrichment activities, and the
   need to launch young-leadership-based community initiatives to promote
   the concept of citizenship among young people.},

Abstract = {Although hands-on activities significantly improve achievement and
   attitudes toward animals, the use of the aesthetically unpleasant is
   questionable. We investigated whether the use of woodlouse, as an
   example of an unpopular animal, alters children's conservation
   attitudes, disgust for and knowledge of woodlice. The experimental group
   (n = 116), but not the control group (n = 110), achieved a better
   woodlouse conservation score with hands-on activities, but the
   intentions for woodlouse conservation were not generalized for
   conserving other animals. Disgust for woodlice was not influenced by the
   treatment, but females, albeit more disgust sensitive than men, showed
   higher conservation scores than men. Woodlouse knowledge scores
   significantly increased in both groups. In summary, this study
   demonstrates both the benefits and limits of using animals which are
   aesthetically unpopular, but essential parts of biodiversity and food
   chains.},

Abstract = {As more and more students from diverse families populate 21st century
   classrooms, the need for more culturally sensitive pedagogical
   approaches intensifies. Although literature suggests that differences of
   parenting styles between immigrant and native-born American parents will
   influence children's learning, classroom teaching, and policy making,
   little is known about whether there is any difference in parental
   involvement in the video game process and parental perceptions of
   integrating video games into the regular classroom. In this aspect, an
   online survey was conducted. Consistent with our hypotheses, although
   the sampled native parents were more likely to hold an overall negative
   attitude toward violence in games, they were less worried about the
   integration of video games in the classroom than immigrant parents were.
   Results also suggested that the sampled immigrant parents were less
   involved in the game playing process than their counterpart native-born
   parents were. Additional correlation analyses revealed that if parents
   held more negative attitudes toward social effects brought on by the
   violence in video games, they would most likely use stricter mediation
   techniques toward their children's video game playing. On the other
   hand, the more negative the attitude was, the more involved parents were
   in their children's gameplay. Implications, limitations and future
   research opportunities were discussed.},

Abstract = {The overall purpose was to analyze the reference to the concept of waste
   (closely related to sustainable development within the framework of
   environmental education) in the regulation that standardizes Compulsory
   Secondary Education. A qualitative research design was carried out based
   on a descriptive statistical analysis. A system of categories has been
   established. The different subjects in which the concept of waste is
   taught, the contents proposed and the approach that is given to the
   concept were analyzed. The concept of waste appeared in different
   expressions, which were the indicators of this study. The results reveal
   that the current legislation, both national and regional, gives very
   little relevance to this concept. Although the regulations offer
   opportunities in education to study this concept, it is insufficient and
   incomplete in this regard. These results allow us to affirm that the
   study of the concept of waste in the school stage is not encouraged.},

   which involved more than 600 adolescent participants aged 14-19 years
   (secondary school, college and university students), the authors have
   defined internet addiction as a complex phenomenon. The prerequisites of
   its development identify and highlights its formation in stages among
   students (mild fascination, passion, addiction, attachment). At the
   ascertaining stage of the experiment, a screening study was carried out
   to examine the state of internet addiction in young students in social
   networks. The results showed the necessity to design and implement
   internet addiction prevention programs for young students, which include
   three main blocks (motivational and cognitive, practice-oriented,
   reflexive), and a systematic plan for its implementation in the
   educational space framework. The stages of the experiment provided
   evidence of the authors' proposed effectiveness of methodologies for
   young people aged 14-19 years. This article may be useful to pedagogues,
   psychologists, and parents of students, social workers, and researchers
   working in the field of addiction prevention among young people.},

Abstract = {An inquiry-based integrative STEM education approach was implemented in
   two fourth grade Elementary Education classes, in Spain, through a
   module on simple machines. The viability of this science education model
   in the official Spanish curriculum and its influence on students'
   attitudes towards science and learning of STEM subjects has been studied
   through an adapted Test of Science Related Attitude scale, achievement
   tests, and teachers' interviews. Students participating in the
   integrative STEM project reported significantly more favourable
   attitudes toward science than students from traditional classrooms.
   Although attitude scale and achievement test results seem to show that
   an integrative STEM education may be feasible in 4th grade of the
   Spanish elementary education, interviews revealed reluctance among
   teachers to use integrative STEM education and more directive
   instructions on implementing such an educational model are demanded.
   Implications for science education and future studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {Objective: To understand the psychological factors inducing university
   students' illegal and criminal behavior, and provide scientific
   reference for provision of targeted preventive measures. Methods: A
   total of 680 school students were randomly selected as study objects
   from universities in random sampling investigation, to be divided into
   intervention group and control group. The intervention group received
   3-month intervention to control the criminal psychological incentive,
   while the control group received no intervention. Results: A significant
   positive correlation between SCL-90 total score and 10 influencing
   factors (r = 0.2257 similar to 0.130 P<0.001 similar to 0.05) was found
   using the self-rating symptom scale as a tool. The multi-factor LOGISTIC
   regression analysis of university students' psychological problems and
   criminal behavior found that the psychological factors affecting
   university students' potential criminal behavior include academic
   stress, love state and interpersonal relationship. After intervention,
   the overall mental health level increased from previous 9.8\% to 88.9\%
   in the intervention group, with statistically significant difference (P
   < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in mental health
   level in various dimensions before and after intervention in the control
   group. Conclusion: Psychological problems prevail among university
   students, of which, employment, love state and interpersonal
   relationship obviously affect university students' criminal behavior.
   Timely adoption of intervention measures can reconstruct the mental
   health system of university students and reduce the risk of crime.},

Abstract = {1799 prospective elementary and prospective science teachers from six
   countries (Croatia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia and
   Turkey) participate in the study about the level of motivation toward
   science courses, pedagogy courses and self-efficacy. The most important
   findings were that choosing educational career as the first choice of
   prospective teachers depends on country and study track. The highest
   percentage of prospective teachers who choose teaching career and will
   probably stay teachers is in participating institutions from Slovenia
   and Croatia and the lowest in Slovakia and Turkey with Czech Republic
   and Lithuania in between. The percentages are higher for prospective
   elementary teachers than for prospective science teachers. Motivation of
   prospective teachers' regarding to the science courses and pedagogy
   courses vary. Differences between countries are small but as a rule
   future science teachers are more motivated for science courses than for
   pedagogy/didactics courses and the opposite is true for elementary
   teachers. Differences on general self-efficacy beliefs vary within and
   between countries? On average values falls in the upper third range what
   can be predictor of good teaching. Correlation between students'
   motivation toward science courses, pedagogy courses and their
   self-efficacy beliefs is statistically significant but low, showing that
   good students are generally motivated for all courses but differences
   between motivation toward science and pedagogy exists and depends on
   study track. Conclusion of our study is that science teachers are better
   equipped to cope with problems than elementary teachers, but elementary
   teachers will most probably work at the working place they choose as
   their first will.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to reveal a method that will help arrange
   creative mathematical problems for the development of creative
   competences of the basic school students. The main method here is
   modeling of creative mathematical problems taking into account the
   complexity levels of the tasks in accordance with the systemic scale and
   the requirements for the formulation of creative tasks in basic school.
   The article presents author's approaches to the differentiation of
   creative mathematical tasks for basic school students in accordance with
   the systemic scale, which were formed by adaptation of creative problem
   solutions classified in terms of their degree of difficulty and the
   quality of the obtained results, considered in the theory of inventive
   problems solving. The author proposes a system of requirements for the
   creative mathematical problem such as the contradiction in the condition
   of the problem, the sufficiency of the condition, the rectitude of the
   question, the independence of facts, the completeness of information,
   and scientific consistency. The system of requirements allows to
   preserve the didactic value of the proposed mathematical problem. As a
   result of experimental research and experiential teaching using creative
   mathematical tasks, the proposed differentiation and the system of
   requirements for the condition were successfully tested. That
   contributes greatly to the development of creative competencies of
   students in the basic school and their ability to solve creative math
   problems. Practical use of creative mathematical problems makes it
   possible to increase schoolchildren's interest to study mathematics and
   show interdisciplinary connections with various disciplines, e.g.,
   informatics, chemistry, biology.},

Abstract = {This study explored the effectiveness of different concept mapping
   techniques on the learning achievement of senior accounting students and
   whether achievements attained using various techniques are affected by
   different learning styles. The techniques are computer-assisted
   construct-by-self-concept mapping (CACSB), computer-assisted
   construct-on-scaffold concept mapping (CACOS), paper-and-pencil concept
   mapping (PAP), and traditional textbook exercise (TTE) methods. A
   pretest-posttest control group design was employed. The subjects were
   151 students who were taking an advanced accounting course. An analysis
   of covariance was used to analyze the results. The research findings are
   fourfold: (1) the two computer-assisted concept mapping techniques
   (CACSB and CACOS) are more beneficial to students' learning achievement
   than PAP and TTE; (2) PAP is better than TTE in relation to students'
   learning achievement; (3) when students' different learning styles were
   taken into account, CACOS offers better assistance to students who have
   accommodating and converging learning styles, followed by CACBS, PAP,
   and TTE; (4) for students who have assimilating and diverging learning
   styles, CACSB has the most significant effects on their learning
   achievement, followed by CACOS, PAP, and TTE. The computer-assisted
   concept mapping technique needs to fit learners' learning styles. The
   match between learning styles and learning techniques will further
   enhance learning achievement.},

Abstract = {In the context of mobile Internet, college students' leisure time has
   fragmentation characteristics to improve the value of time, it is of
   great practical significance to make full use of fragmentation time to
   study effectively. This research focuses on mobile learning model and
   its effect, firstly, qualitative research is used to construct the
   mobile learning model and mobile learning mechanism which is different
   from the traditional teaching mode; Secondly, based on the perspective
   of ``Mobile Internet + Teaching{''} and a case of ``international
   marketing{''} course, the author uses the method of questionnaire and
   single group quasi experiment to test the learning effect. The empirical
   results show that the mobile learning model can fully mobilize the
   enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the students in the mobile
   learning process and help to improve the quality of learning, efficiency
   and effectiveness of teaching. Comprehensively utilizing system push,
   multiple customizations and multiple communication functions of mobile
   communication platform to reach the orientation of ``learn everything
   you can, everywhere you can{''}, so, take specific course to carry out
   practice testing, which provides theoretical reference for the relevant
   curriculum teaching reform.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a scale instrument to allow us
   to establish the self-efficacies of elementary education teachers
   regarding their use of information technologies when educating their
   students. The study group comprised a total of 924 teachers from
   different branches working in central Ankara elementary schools. Based
   on the data acquired from the scales, exploratory and confirmatory
   factor analyses were conducted during the process of testing the
   construct validity of the scale. In the wake of the exploratory and
   confirmatory factor analysis, the model comprising 48 clauses and two
   factors was found to be statistically and theoretically coherent. When
   the obtained results are considered with regards to its reliability, the
   scale can be said to be sufficiently reliable. The scale instrument is
   thought to put forth perceptions of self-efficacy regarding the use of
   technology from the context of basic skills and anxiety state.},

Abstract = {Using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as its theoretical
   foundation, this study intends to explore the use of Travelling Beam
   devices in road engineerings in Taiwan and offer suggestions based on
   its findings to encourage industry willingness for device deployment
   resulting in improving road pavement smoothness in Taiwan. The study
   subjects were pavement smoothness device operators in Taiwan. A total of
   107 valid questionnaires were returned. The questionnaire results were
   analyzed using descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis and
   structural equation modeling. Study results show that more
   training/support and perceived ease of use can lead to more willingness
   to use travelling beam devices and consequentially help improve pavement
   smoothness. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis results also
   indicate training/support, perceived ease of use and attitude will give
   users' positive attitudes towards use of travelling beam devices.},

Abstract = {In the knowledge economy era, the competitive advantage of an enterprise
   is established on intangible resources and capability. Trust allows
   individuals acquiring and exchanging intellectual capitals, especially
   in ambiguous and uncertain situations, and knowledge exchange relies on
   the existence of trust. Different from past other industries, hi-tech
   industry stresses on intangible assets, endeavors to transform real
   assets into valuable knowledge, and manage and create ``intellectual
   property{''} based on value for specific operating performance of an
   enterprise. This study therefore discusses the effect of organizational
   trust on organizational learning and creativity in hi-tech industry.

Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to explore South African Grade 11
   learners' conceptual understanding of `image formation by lenses'. The
   participants for this study were 70 Grade 11 learners from a selected
   senior secondary school in Mthatha, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.
   The qualitative approach employed in the study made use of a two-tier
   open-ended questionnaire as the data collection instrument. The study
   explored several alternative conceptions the learners had held in terms
   of the roles that the lens and the screen play in the image formation
   and the characteristics of the image formed when a lens with a larger
   diameter is used and when a portion of the lens is covered. Most of the
   participants could not respond correctly in the situations presented in
   the questionnaire. However, almost all of them were found to have
   adequate conceptual understanding about the role of a lens in the image
   formation.},

Abstract = {This research is a qualitative case research. The objects were eight
   senior high students taking information application program in Nan Oau
   Aboriginal Key Senior high school in Taiwan. The study was aim to design
   a project-based e-book making course for Nan Oau Aboriginal Key Senior
   high school by studying the Atayal handicraft art curriculums. The
   course had six units, including two free creation units, and three
   lessons per unit for a total of 18 lessons, 900 minutes. Collections of
   research data included the research notes, the teaching observation
   notes, the problem-solving examination forms, the e-book making
   evaluation forms, the interview outlines, and the students' learning
   sheets and homework.
   After collecting and cross analyzing the information, the main results
   were as follows:
   A) Most of the students were satisfied with this e-book making course.
   B) The students performed best in ``the quality of problem solving{''},
   and ``the attitudes of how they face problems{''} next. However, the
   ways how they ``deal with problems{''} last, which should be enhanced.
   C) Their e-book works were all appreciated by professors, teachers,
   craftsmen, and students. During the problem-solving process, they faced
   problems with a positive attitude and displayed initiative and
   willingness to solve problems.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at examining context effects of processing science
   terminology in Chinese during the reading process. The science texts
   were first chosen, and then they were replaced by science terminology
   with familiar words; other common words remained in both texts. The
   results implied that readers spent longer rereading durations and total
   fixation durations for the same common words in science texts than for
   corresponding texts. Readers performed shorter gaze durations for
   replaced words than the science terminology. However, the first fixation
   durations for the two-word types did not show significant differences
   from each other. Besides, readers sought for more contextual information
   to aid their comprehension. The adult readers seemed to successfully
   process the meanings of each Chinese characters but they failed to
   access the meanings of science terminology at the initial processing
   stage. With the assistance of contextual information, the adult readers
   were able to comprehend the unfamiliar words. Instruction for teaching
   science in school was suggested to improve the learning processes.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on teachers' views on concept mapping: its
   applicability; reliability; advantages and; difficulties. A close-ended
   questionnaire was administered to 50 purposefully selected secondary
   school mathematics teachers from Sekhukhune District, Limpopo, South
   Africa. The findings indicate that mathematics teachers generally
   perceive that concept map: is useful; effective; is a practical tool for
   teaching mathematical concepts; represents and organises knowledge;
   helps retention and recall of concepts learnt and; provides feedback on
   the understanding of the concepts learnt. An important implication of
   this study is that there is a need for teachers to incorporate the
   concept mapping in the formative assessment process.},

Abstract = {The study investigated early years teachers' understanding and use of
   graphic symbols, defined as the visual representation(s) used to
   communicate one or more ``linguistic{''} concepts, which can be used to
   facilitate science learning. The study was conducted in Cyprus where six
   early years teachers were observed and interviewed. The results indicate
   that the teachers had a good understanding of the role of symbols, but
   demonstrated a lack of understanding in regards to graphic symbols
   specifically. None of the teachers employed them in their observed
   science lesson, although some of them claimed that they did so. Findings
   suggest a gap in participants' acquaintance with the terminology
   regarding different types of symbols and a lack of awareness about the
   use and availability of graphic symbols for the support of learning.
   There is a need to inform and train early years teachers about graphic
   symbols and their potential applications in supporting children's
   learning.},

Abstract = {This study used content analysis to examine the most studied conceptual
   change factors that influence students' science learning processes and
   their learning outcomes. The reviewed research included empirical
   studies published since Posner et al. proposed their conceptual change
   model 30 years ago (from 1982 to 2011). One hundred sixteen SSCI journal
   and full text articles were sampled from the Education Resources
   Information Center database. ``Conceptual change{''} in the title of the
   articles was used for screening the articles. The results showed that
   learning outcomes chiefly examined students' conceptual change and their
   science achievement. The most studied factors influencing conceptual
   change were associated with instruction and personal reasoning ability.
   As for instruction, multiple instructional methods were usually
   integrated in the research, and ``conceptual conflict{''} and
   ``cooperative learning{''} were found to be gaining the most attention.
   In addition, certain instructional methods were more frequently linked
   to specific science subjects. Educators require knowledge of conceptual
   change theories and strategies. Such information should be more readily
   available in order to develop teachers' pedagogical content knowledge
   and help them put it effectively into practice.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate how a poster study focusing on the
   biographies of today's scientists affected 8th graders' scientist
   images. The study utilized a mixed model which combined qualitative and
   quantitative research techniques. 142 8th graders from a secondary
   school in Ankara Province Kecioren District participated in the study.
   Implementation took place in the spring term of 2013-2014 academic
   years. In implementation, students were given ``Draw A Scientist Test
   (DAST){''} in order to determine the scientist image of students before
   and after implementation and students were asked to explain scientists
   in their drawings. After the pretest, control group students continued
   their training following the curriculum, while experimental group
   students were given the task of preparing poster studies titled
   ``biographies of today's scientists'{''} in addition to their regular
   curriculum. According to research results, poster study on biographies
   of today's scientists had no effect on 8th graders' scientist images. In
   this sense, it can be argued that teaching process should include
   biographies of past scientists rather than today's scientists and
   teaching practices that include the use of posters in presentations and
   discussions should be carried out with students at different educational
   levels.},

Abstract = {The current study aims to explore ICT integration in Turkish K-12
   schools purposively selected as a representation of F@tih and non-F@tih
   public schools together with a private school. A convergent mixed
   methods design was employed with a multiple case strategy as such it
   will enable to make casewise comparisons. The quantitative data was
   collected through e-capacity measurement scales. Concurrently, the
   qualitative data was gathered through three open-ended questions. The
   evaluation results illustrate that a private school outperformed all
   public schools, including F@tih and non-F@tih schools. However there are
   some promising results indicating that F@tih project has made some
   significant inroads into improvement of ICT related school conditions,
   specifically ICT infrastructure of public schools. Yet, the findings
   also illustrate that ICT coordination and support, ICT vision, policy
   and teachers' ICT training, and their ICT use are policy domains that
   should be addressed and improved in both F@tih and non-F@tih schools.},

Abstract = {To assist learners in obtaining professional abilities, meet social
   demand for talent, and achieve favorable educational outcomes, academic
   courses generally have unique syllabuses, learning goals, and teaching
   purposes according to their characteristics and specialized knowledge
   and skills. Furthermore, it could help the students of Industrial Design
   enhance the connection with employment after the graduation when they
   understand the characteristics of auxiliary devices and equipment before
   entering workplaces. Meanwhile, the students being cultivated the design
   capability could improve and innovate tools, as the improvement of
   auxiliary devices and the practical design of innovative products and
   the functions from a professional engineer are close to the users'
   demands. In this study, the Delphi method, a group decision-making
   technique, andthe analytic hierarchy process (AHP) multiattribute
   decision-making function was adopted to establish a decision-making
   model for designing multifunctional products for assessing the students
   of Industrial Design in learning effectiveness in innovative engineering
   product design and development. In addition, a practical multifunctional
   product-design case was investigated to demonstrate the application of
   the model. This study found that integrating interdisciplinary courses
   and instruction by industry professionals and introducing
   industry-academia cooperation had a considerable influence on
   interdisciplinary teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {This study aims to develop a feasible instrument for determining middle
   school students' motivation to learn technology in South Korea. The
   authors translated Glynn's motivational instrument and modified it to
   measure Korean middle school students' motivation to learn technology.
   The instrument was applied to 441 students of grade 8 and 9 from six
   different middle schools in metropolitan cities in South Korea. We
   conducted both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor
   analysis to validate the modified instrument. In addition, we
   investigated motivational differences by gender and career pursuit using
   an independent t-test and identified factors affecting preference for
   technology subject. In terms of the results, first, we identified five
   sub-factors governing the motivation to learn technology. Second, we
   confirmed three factors that affect the preference for technology
   subjects, namely, intrinsic motivation, career motivation, and teacher
   preference. This study provides meaningful insights for technology
   educators into teaching and learning strategies to consider diverse
   motivational factors and students' gender and career pursuit.},

Abstract = {Delivering knowledge and economic information through the Internet has
   been so popular that a lot of countries make major information
   technology construction plans to enhance competitiveness. In this case,
   sharing educational resources and narrowing the rural-urban education
   divide with computer networks have become a common trend globally.
   Educational reform in past years does not simply focus on memorizing
   materials, but learning practical knowledge so that the importance of
   cognition in learning processes is highlighted. When engaging in a task,
   a person has to know the resources which he/she owns, the task
   requirements, the timing for using strategies, solving problems,
   regulating oneself, and monitoring personal working conditions in order
   to effectively complete the tasks.
   This study focuses on universities students majoring in hospitality
   management in Taiwan. A total of 600 copies of the questionnaire were
   distributed to college students and 396 valid copies were collected,
   with the retrieval rate of 66\% for this study. The research results
   reveal that: 1. Self-regulated learning shows significant positive
   effects on motivational beliefs; 2. Motivational beliefs present
   remarkably positive effects on academic performance; and 3.
   Self-regulated learning appears to have notably positive effects on
   academic performance. According to the research results, conclusions and
   suggestions are proposed at the end of this study, intending to enhance
   teachers' instruction and students' academic performance.},

Title = {Students' Representational Fluency at University: A Cross-Sectional
   Measure of How Multiple Representations are Used by Physics Students
   Using the Representational Fluency Survey},

Abstract = {To succeed within scientific disciplines, using representations,
   including those based on words, graphs, equations, and diagrams, is
   important. Research indicates that the use of discipline specific
   representations (sometimes referred to as expert generated
   representations), as well as multi-representational use, is critical for
   problem solving and developing understanding. This paper consolidates
   these ideas using the Representational Fluency Survey (RFS) over two
   years with 334 students at The University of Sydney. Analysis shows that
   there was a significant difference between the representational fluency
   of the 1st year Fundamental and Regular students (low level 1st year
   physics courses) compared to the 1st year Advanced, 2nd year, 3rd year
   and Postgraduate level students. The existence of this distinct gap is
   further supported by evidence from qualitative coding that students with
   a high level of representational fluency use a greater number of
   representations and more visual and symbolic representations to explain
   their answers. There is no mention of such an overall trend of variation
   of representational use in extant literature, largely because there have
   been no studies that compare representational fluency across closely
   spaced levels of physics, or science, learning.},

Abstract = {This paper investigated pre-service mathematics teachers' mathematics
   beliefs, beliefs about information and communication technology (ICT),
   and their relationships. 787 pre-service mathematics teachers in China
   completed a survey questionnaire measuring their beliefs about the
   nature of mathematics, beliefs about mathematics learning and teaching,
   attitudes toward ICT, and beliefs about ICT use in mathematics
   education. Descriptive statistics, simple correlation analysis, and
   step-wise progression analysis were performed in the data analysis. The
   results indicate that pre-service mathematics teachers' dynamic belief
   about the nature of mathematics, constructivist belief about mathematics
   learning and teaching, and positive attitudes towards ICT are more
   likely to be correlated with their constructivist belief about ICT use.
   In contrast, their traditional beliefs about the nature of mathematics
   and its learning and teaching are more likely to be associated with
   their traditional beliefs about ICT use.},

Abstract = {The present study sought to design calculus tasks to determine students'
   preference for visual or analytic processing as well as examine the role
   of preferred mode of processing in calculus performance and its
   relationship to spatial ability and verbal-logical reasoning ability.
   Data were collected from 150 high school students who were enrolled in
   Advanced Placement calculus courses. The measures of preferred mode of
   processing did not correlate with the measures of spatial ability and
   verbal-logical reasoning ability, suggesting that cognitive abilities
   did not predict the students' preference for visual or analytic
   processing. Multiple regression analysis revealed that spatial
   visualization ability, verbal-logical reasoning ability, preference for
   visual processing contributed significantly to the variance in calculus
   performance. Correlations between calculus performance and the measures
   of preferred mode processing suggest that the nature and complexity of
   mathematical tasks might have influenced the students' degree of
   preference for using visual processing.},

   been found between the achievement levels of U. S. and Korean students
   in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) mathematics.
   Since PISA measures the mathematical proficiency of 15-year-old
   students, this study focuses primarily on 8th-grade curriculum standards
   and textbooks. The findings provide valuable information for curriculum
   designers and textbook editors to help improve the quality of geometry
   curricula and textbooks. Teachers can also use these findings to assess
   the proficiency levels of items in the textbooks they use, so that they
   can develop lesson plans appropriate to the ability of their students

Abstract = {Cultural values, traditions, and symbols are manifested in the life
   every society. Culture, therefore, occupies a very important place in
   human life and society, affecting economic, social, religious, and
   educational activities. Education in general and mathematical education
   in particular is also affected by cultural values. This essay discusses
   the importance of the development and implementation of math curricula
   that integrates cultural and folkloric elements and values from the
   daily life and society of the students, including folklore stories,
   games, and tools, and their contribution to increasing student
   motivation to study math, which in turn improves their academic
   achievements in this subject.},

Abstract = {For a few decades now, scholars have tried to make mathematics education
   more meaningful and motivating by using narratives. However, there still
   remains a gap between the theory of narratives and classroom practice.
   In this paper we provide two design heuristics for teachers by which to
   bridge this gap. We discuss Dietiker's mathematical story framework,
   based on narratology, and present a design heuristic based on this
   framework by which to design mathematical stories. We extend this
   heuristic on the basis of the work of the Russian formalist Vladimir
   Propp, who analyzed Russian folktales. He found that 31 irreducible
   narrative elements, called functions or narratemes, can be
   distinguished. We exemplify our heuristics by means of two mathematical
   stories, one of which concerns Kepler's conjecture. The value of this
   approach is that it provides mathematics teachers with a heuristic story
   framework that is suitable for designing or redesigning mathematical
   stories.},

Abstract = {This research is presented in a way that provides useful knowledge for
   successful problem posing by mathematics pre-service teachers. We
   present a review of the concept of mathematical creativity (by different
   authors) and review studies that underline the relevance of problem
   posing in teaching mathematics, studies that consider problem posing a
   way to identify students' learning patterns and to test them, and
   studies that relate mathematical competences to problem posing.
   Participants in the study were 10 pre-service teachers who were
   successful in problem solving. Data were gathered through qualitative
   techniques: classroom observations, sequences of tasks, questionnaires,
   student focus groups and discussion. The case study illustrated some of
   pre-service teachers' difficulties in problem posing: creating problems
   that students recognize as relevant to their everyday lives, problems
   adapted to the school curriculum at a specific educational level, and
   problems that can be self-corrected.},

Abstract = {This study integrates STEM education and imaginative education with
   project-based learning, and develops a set of ``iSTEM (imagination,
   science, technology, engineering, mathematics) learning{''} methods in
   order to construct iSTEM ability indexes for vocational high school
   students and to explore the application and effectiveness of the
   learning model. This study employed the fuzzy Delphi method, a
   questionnaire survey, content analysis and focus group interviews and
   included 12 experts and 39 vocational high school students as the
   subjects. The important results obtained in this study are as follows:
   20 iSTEM imagination ability indexes and 50 STEM integrated thinking and
   application ability indexes are constructed; a student-centered iSTEM
   learning model is developed; iSTEM learning activities can enhance the
   learning and integration of STEM knowledge; the iSTEM learning model
   produces a positive effect on integrated STEM thinking and the
   imagination ability of vocational high school students. Finally, this
   study puts forward recommendations for improving STEM education
   practices, teaching strategy design and high-level STEM ability
   assessment in the future.},

Abstract = {Studying teachers' knowledge management is also an entry point to
   studying knowledge management in the field of education. To guarantee
   the healthy and continuous development of teachers' knowledge management
   ability, it is crucial to evaluate their management level in a
   scientific, objective and comprehensive way. Using the expert
   consultation and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we put forward and
   set up an evaluation index system for college teachers' knowledge
   management, we evaluated the knowledge management levels of college
   teachers. The results showed that rankings of knowledge management
   levels of college teachers were knowledge acquisition, knowledge
   organization, knowledge development and knowledge innovation from high
   to low. Their knowledge management was above the average as a whole.
   From all levels, the scores of knowledge acquisition and knowledge
   organization were relatively high.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid wavelet neural network (HWNN) model is developed
   for effectively forecasting rainfall with the data of antecedent monthly
   rainfalls, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is combined with
   particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to improve performance of
   artificial neural network (ANN) model. ACO is adopted to initialize the
   network connection the weights of and thresholds of WNN and PSO is used
   to update the parameters of ACO, HWNN can avoid falling into a local
   optimal solution and improve its convergence rate and obtain more
   accurate results. In simulations based on monthly rainfall data from the
   city of Ningde in the southeastern China. The forecasting performance is
   compared with observed rainfall values, and evaluated by common
   statistics of relative absolute error, root mean square error and
   average absolute percentage error. The results show that the HWNN model
   improves the monthly rainfall forecasting accuracy over Ningde in
   comparison to the reference models. The performance comparison shows
   that the proposed approach performs appreciably better than the compared
   approaches. Through the experimental results, the proposed approach has
   shown excellent prediction performance.},

Abstract = {In New Era high level thinking skills, personal development and network
   could be demonstrated as the keys of life success. Because of this,
   enrichment camps became very popular. This paper presents the layout and
   results of a summer camp project that aims to promote insight on high
   school students towards many disciplines of science, culture, develop
   their self-confidence and help high school students to choose the most
   appropriate job for themselves. The students introduced university
   lectures from different branches such as; molecular biology and
   genetics, solid works, international relations, forensic psychology,
   nano materials and x-ray analyses etc. The the core body of knowledge
   has been enriched with applications in a laboratory environment. The
   students have been assigned to learn by experience with the help of
   hands-on project design activities during the project. Drama, cultural
   tours, seminars, meetings, sports, dance and yoga have been used as
   social activities for introducing campus life and facilities. In
   addition to these, the students have also been informed about the
   importance of discovering their interests and talents within the scope
   of this camp. This program was in operation in summer term of 2015-2016
   academic year at Istanbul Aydin University. The students were given
   semi-structured interview and the data were analyzed through descriptive
   analysis. The sample of the study consists of 39 students coming from
   different state and private schools in different cities. The results
   indicated that summer camp increased academic motivation, awareness of
   life and career also the socialization skills of the participants.
   Besides, the students stated that they were able to be recognize of a
   university, university environment, scientists and different
   professions.},

Abstract = {The call to reform education systems is being heard in many countries
   around the world. The purpose of this study is to develop and apply a
   framework that captures some of the essential qualities of the knowledge
   required by teachers for effective pedagogical practice in a
   technology-enhanced educational environment using technology and
   pedagogy content knowledge (TPACK). A TPACK Short and Quick (TPACK-SQ)
   survey questionnaire was used to explore and assess 244 in- and
   pre-service science and mathematics teachers in Kuwait. The results of
   the survey showed that in-service teachers needed help with some aspects
   of TPACK. Therefore, a workshop was developed and 57 in-service teachers
   were enrolled and trained based on the TPACK-SQ model. The results of
   posttests for their knowledge were significantly positive as against
   pretests. The workshop thus provides a rich example of how to support
   the implementation of essential elements of the TPACK-SQ model.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to develop content and identify appropriate
   methods, forms and means of studying formal languages that take into
   account the specific character of professional development of the future
   specialist. The methodological basis of the study is the system approach
   and the methodology for selecting the content of education, which allows
   to generalize and systematize the process of constructing the content of
   teaching formal languages, and to improve the content of training to
   specific formal languages. The article suggests a system for studying
   mathematical foundations of formal languages as a system-forming element
   in the training of specialists in the field of computer science,
   programming, and IT-technologies. It gives reasons for the inclusion of
   elements of the theory of formal languages in the learning process,
   defines the structure and content of learning tasks and objectives,
   develops the system of end-to-end concepts and the logical structure of
   the course program, suggests the order of presenting the training
   material, the system of training assignments for a laboratory course on
   a computer. The developed system allows graduates to get the opportunity
   to develop a high-level understanding of systems in general, which
   contributes to a common understanding of the structure of computer
   systems, and the processes of their creation and analysis.},

Abstract = {The psychological harmony of kindergarten teachers will have a profound
   influence on the development of children's psychological health, but
   relatively few studies of kindergarten teachers in the mind. This
   article is based on the establishment of kindergarten teachers in the
   minds of harmonious questionnaire, attitude and interpersonal
   relation-ship, campus culture, from the outside world, self-psychology
   expounded in four directions, the harmonious status of staff quantifies,
   and it is concluded that the survey is to the reliability and validity.
   In addition, the harmony in the overall analysis of kindergarten
   teachers in the heart, heart teachers low heart harmony level is poorer,
   the in the mind high group and intermediate group teacher heart harmony
   level is higher; Also, came to the kindergarten teachers in the heart of
   harmony and there is a positive correlation relationship between job
   satisfaction, at the same time, the higher the degree of harmony of the
   heart the corresponding work of the higher the degree of satisfaction.},

Abstract = {High-tech industry creates economy for Taiwan; nevertheless, it is
   wondered whether it also results in environment crises. With the
   excellent geo-environment, fast growth of parks, and global product
   marketing, Taiwan is successfully promoted to the third of information
   industry and the fourth of semiconductor industry globally after
   developing for two decades. In consideration of the rising demands for
   environment-friendly products, it is a primary issue for hi-tech
   industry in Taiwan to develop environment-friendly products conforming
   to market demands and to further get rid of the vicious circle of price
   competition by enhancing employees' environmental literacy through
   environmental education. Aiming at supervisors and employees of
   enterprises in Hsinchu Science Park, total 500 copies of questionnaire
   are distributed in this study. 327 valid copies are retrieved, with the
   retrieval rate 65\%. The research results conclude that 1.
   environment-friendly product R\&D shows significantly positive
   correlations with green innovation capability, 2. environmental
   education reveals remarkably positive correlations with
   environment-friendly product R\&D, and 3. environmental education
   presents notably positive correlations with green innovation capability.
   Based on the research results, suggestions are proposed in this study,
   expecting to assist hi-tech industry in developing environmental
   education and grasping green business opportunities to further get rid
   of the vicious circle of price competition.},

Abstract = {A five-stage prediction-observation-explanation inquiry-based learning
   (FPOEIL) model was developed to improve students' scientific learning
   performance. In order to intensify the science learning effect, the
   repertory grid technology-assisted learning (RGTL) approach and the
   collaborative learning (CL) approach were utilized. A quasi-experimental
   design study was conducted to examine whether the students who used the
   FPOEIL model only had better learning performances than those who used
   FPOEIL with RGTL or CL. This study adopted purposive sampling, selecting
   123 fourth grade students. The experimental process was conducted during
   five weeks. It was found that the FPOEIL model improved the students'
   learning performance. Moreover, the low prior knowledge students who
   learned science using FPOEIL with RGTL or CL had better learning
   performances than those who learned using the FPOEIL model only, and the
   effectiveness showed no significant differences between the low prior
   knowledge students and the high prior knowledge students. Using the
   FPOEIL model, the positive effects were intensified in the continuous
   inquiry-based learning activities and feedback-correction process for
   the students learning science. The RGTL approach helped the students
   find, remember, and comprehend scientific knowledge. In the CL process,
   the students spent more time discussing how to integrate clues to answer
   the science question.},

Abstract = {We show an approach to semi-automatic grading of answers given by
   students to open ended questions (open answers). We use both
   peer-evaluation and teacher evaluation. A learner is modeled by her
   Knowledge and her assessments quality (Judgment). The data generated by
   the peer- and teacher-evaluations, and by the learner models is
   represented by a Bayesian Network, in which the grades of the answers,
   and the elements of the learner models, are variables, with values in a
   probability distribution. The initial state of the network is determined
   by the peer- assessment data. Then, each teacher's grading of an answer
   triggers evidence propagation in the network. The framework is
   implemented in a web-based system. We present also an experimental
   activity, set to verify the effectiveness of the approach, in terms of
   correctness of system grading, amount of required teacher's work, and
   correlation of system outputs with teacher's grades and student's final

Abstract = {The research reported on here is part of a larger study exploring the
   alignment of the intended, implemented and attained curriculum with
   regard to practical work in the Zimbabwean A-level Biology curriculum.
   In this paper we focus on the alignment between the intended and
   implemented A-Level Biology curriculum through the lens of teachers'
   interpretation of the curriculum. This interpretive study sought to
   understand how teachers interpret a particular curriculum design.
   Participants were five teachers drawn from four High schools in
   Zimbabwe. The findings show a misalignment between the intended and
   implemented curriculum caused by teachers' misinterpretation of the
   intended curriculum. Teachers lacked knowledge of Science Process Skills
   and could not interpret them from the curriculum documents. They
   interpreted the curriculum through the examinations and were reluctant
   to engage with the curriculum in order to understand the objectives for
   practical work. The poor design of the curriculum contributed to this
   reluctance. This misalignment has implications for curriculum design and
   implementation.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the influence that the ``Environmental
   Leadership Professional Development{''} program had on preschool
   teachers. The program's aim is to enhance environmental awareness, thus
   developing environmental citizenship and leadership. The program offered
   experiential and reflective learning, meetings with environmental
   researchers and educators, discussions, a course website, and most
   uniquely, an environmental venture exemplifying active environmental
   leadership and citizenship conducted by the learners and accompanied by
   intensive professional support. Data sources included questionnaires
   presented before, immediately after, and one year after the program, and
   the portfolios documenting the venture's processes and outcomes. The
   qualitative evidence attests to affirmative change among the
   participants, who demonstrated personal growth and empowerment as
   educators and leaders, even a year after the program ended. The results
   indicate that the ``Environmental Leadership Professional
   Development{''} program may serve as a professional development model
   for empowering teachers to become both environmental leaders and
   environmental citizen role models.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the perspectives of
   pre-service and inservice teachers in the College of Education (COE) at
   Kuwait University (KU) on the use of online streaming media services as
   a facilitative and innovative tool for teaching, learning, professional
   development, and teacher preparation. Five research questions were used
   to compile a questionnaire and to guide analysis of the data. Various
   descriptive methods of analysis were applied to the collected data
   (e.g., frequencies and percentages to summarize the demographic data;
   means and standard deviations to address the research questions). The
   study revealed that the participants' awareness of the availability of
   such services is low (M = 2.49; SD = 0.57). However, their attitudes
   toward online streaming media as an innovative tool for teaching,
   learning, professional development, and teacher preparation were
   significantly positive among all subgroups, with a high mean score (M =
   4.5213, and SD = 0.27707). Thus, online streaming media prepares
   teachers and students alike for a voyage of imagination and discovery.
   No school can afford to be without this tool-a gateway to a new world of

Abstract = {This study was conducted in order to analyze the relation between high
   school students' Facebook addiction and loneliness levels. The study was
   conducted with the relational screening model. The sample of the study
   consists of 712 randomly selected high school students. The data was
   collected using the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale (BFAS) to analyze
   the students' Facebook tendencies and with the UCLA Loneliness Scale to
   analyze the students' levels of loneliness. Data was analyzed with
   descriptive statistic instruments along with t-test, ANOVA test, LSD
   test, and Correlation Analysis. Research findings suggest that the
   Facebook addiction levels of the high school students in the sample are
   rather low. Analyses conducted regarding the gender variable indicate
   that there is no relationship between Facebook addiction levels and the
   time spent on Facebook. Findings show that students most commonly share
   photographs and videos. This suggests that students use Facebook as a
   leisure pastime. Also, analyses indicate that there is a statistical
   significant relationship between the time participants spend on Facebook
   and their Facebook addiction scores. Findings of the study suggest that
   both male and female students' loneliness scores are low. In addition,
   the Correlation Analysis conducted to determine participants' Facebook
   addiction and loneliness levels was examined and no statistical
   significant relationships were found. According to the findings, it can
   be asserted that the participants of this study are not in the risk
   group regarding their Facebook addiction and loneliness levels.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a cloud multi-criteria group decision-making model
   for teacher evaluation in higher education which is involving
   subjectivity, imprecision and fuzziness. First, selecting the
   appropriate evaluation index depending on the evaluation objectives,
   indicating a clear structural relationship between the evaluation index
   and objectives and establishing a proper evaluation system are all
   critical and fundamental tasks. Then, collect expert evaluation data,
   process data, establish training set to build the decision trees,
   extract evaluation rules, simplify evaluation process, while reducing
   the cost of evaluation in real applications. Third, establish the
   interval cloud evaluation matrix through the decision cloud,
   transforming the evaluation value through the cloud model, determining
   the order of importance of the decision program, and make the decision.
   Finally, an addressing linguistic decision-making problem for college
   teacher evaluation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed model.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an ongoing study of the development of a
   customizable web browser information organization and management system,
   which the author has named Lexicon Sextant (LS). LS is a user friendly,
   graphical web based add-on to the latest generation of web browsers,
   such as Google Chrome, making it easier and more intuitive to store and
   retrieve favorites (bookmarks) since it only uses two levels (six main
   headings \& 12 sub-headings). A total of 98 participants completed the
   task of categorizing 18 thumbnails from specific websites, together with
   18 thumbnails from random websites, under six main LS headings, i.e.
   Work, Lifestyle, Travel, Health, Education, and Money. This was followed
   by a recall exercise of 12 randomly generated websites. The results
   showed that the participants had a better correction rate in Money and
   Lifestyle, but a worse correction rate in Work and Education among the
   overall correction rate, appointed correction rate, and self-chosen
   correction rate, in terms of each category task performance.},

Abstract = {Since the popular applications of information technology, digitalized
   materials, media, and equipment have become the essential abilities and
   instruments for teachers in modern education. In addition to some
   curricula requiring computing \& reasoning and operation \&
   demonstration, the situations of teachers utilizing transparencies,
   films, and network communications present that digitalized materials
   have become the mainstream teaching instruments. Creative Thinking
   Instruction is also largely promoted in school education that various
   creative teaching strategies are created. Such teaching strategies or
   models aim to develop and cultivate students' creative teaching
   abilities through various effective routes and approaches. The effects
   of teaching approaches and strategies on students' learning achievements
   and interests as well as the use of distinct teaching strategies and
   approaches for the promotion of teaching effectiveness are considered as
   the research motivation. The quasi-experimental research is preceded
   with the nonequivalent pretest posttest control group design model,
   where 104 students in two classes in a national university are selected
   for the experiment. The research results show that 1. Creative Thinking
   Instruction presents higher sensitivity than general traditional
   instruction, 2. Creative Thinking Instruction reveals higher fluency
   than general traditional instruction, 3. Immersion in virtual reality
   appears the highest sensitivity on Creative Thinking Instruction, and 4.
   Interaction in virtual reality presents the highest fluency on Creative
   Thinking Instruction},

Abstract = {As technology has become more advanced and accessible in instructional
   settings, there has been an upward trend in computer-based testing in
   the last decades. The present experimental study examines students'
   behaviors during computer-based testing in two different conditions and
   explores how these conditions affect the test results. Results indicate
   that some of the psychometric features of a test (reliability and
   validity) could be enriched on computer-based testing if students are
   provided optimum item response time. In addition, it was found that
   providing optimum response time for each item influenced the students in
   the experimental group to not engage in rapid guessing behaviors.
   Thereby, students spent a reasonable amount of time answering the
   questions, which resulted in more reliable and valid scores,
   aforementioned. Lastly, there was no statistically significant
   difference in two groups in terms of student performance.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine relationships among pre-service
   science teachers' conceptual knowledge of electric current, motivational
   beliefs, and self-regulation. One hundred and twenty-seven students
   (female = 107, male = 20) enrolled in the science education program of a
   public university in Ankara participated the study. A concept map
   technique was used to determine students' conceptual knowledge level of
   electric current. To determine students' motivational beliefs and
   self-regulation, a scale developed by Velayutham, Aldridge, and Fraser
   (2011) was first translated into Turkish and adapted to Turkish culture
   and then used as a measurement tool. Results showed that students'
   motivational beliefs were positively associated with their
   self-regulation, and students' task value, self-efficacy, and
   self-regulation were positively related with students' conceptual
   knowledge of electric current. These results show that students'
   motivational beliefs and self-regulation have important roles in
   students' conceptual knowledge level when assessed using concept map
   technique.},

Abstract = {The current work reveals the data of the study which examines the
   relationships among epistemological beliefs, conceptions of learning,
   and self-efficacy for biology learning with the help of the Structural
   Equation Modeling. Three questionnaires, the Epistemological Beliefs,
   the Conceptions of Learning Biology and the Self-efficacy for Learning
   Biology, have been used to investigate 384 high school students'
   epistemological beliefs, conceptions of learning, and self-efficacy for
   learning biology, respectively. The results indicate that the students'
   epistemological beliefs about the source/certainty, justification, and
   development of biology knowledge have some direct and positive relations
   with some factors of conceptions of learning. Moreover, it has been
   found that those students' epistemological beliefs about justification
   and development, and their conceptions of learning about applying,
   understanding, and seeing in a new way directly and positively relate to
   the students' self-efficacy for learning. Only the source/certainty of
   knowledge directly and negatively relates to the students'
   self-efficacy. In addition, the students' epistemological beliefs play
   an indirect role in the students' self efficacy through the mediator of
   conceptions of learning. It can be said that all these information about
   the students' epistemological beliefs, conceptions of learning, and
   self-efficacy for biology learning are required for an effective
   teaching and learning process.},

Abstract = {The main aim of this study was to determine the teaching practices of
   prospective high school physics teachers with respect to their
   preference for teaching as a traditionalist or as a constructivist. To
   study the beliefs of prospective high school physics teachers on this
   subject, firstly, the Teacher Belief Survey was administered to 135
   prospective high school physics teachers; and then semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with eleven prospective high school physics
   teachers. Analyzing of the survey and interviews showed that most
   prospective high school teachers had intermediate (traditionalist to
   constructivist) beliefs about teaching physics.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the effectiveness of integrating Interactive
   Whiteboard (IWB) into the junior high school biology teaching. This
   research adopts a quasi-experimental design and divides the
   participating students into the conventional ICT-integrated learning
   environment and IWB-integrated learning environment. Before teaching,
   students took the pre-test of summative assessment. The entire teaching
   process was recorded as a teaching video for analysis of teacher-student
   verbal interactions. Finally, students took the post-test of summative
   assessment and Constructivist Multimedia Learning Environment Survey
   (Maro \& Fraser, 2005). The findings show that students in the IWB group
   have significantly better learning effectiveness. They also tend to have
   more positive attitudes towards their learning environment. The verbal
   interactions in the IWB group tend to involve less lecturing and more
   active participation by students.},

Abstract = {The advent of integrated multidisciplinary research has given rise to
   some of the most important breakthroughs of our time, but has also set
   significant challenges to the current educational paradigm. Current
   academic education often limits cross-discipline discussion, depends on
   close-ended problems, and restricts utilization of interdisciplinary
   methods. ``Advanced Methods in Mathematical Programming{''} is a new
   course developed at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. We used MATLAB
   as the course platform, exploiting the software's high levels of
   abstraction and modularity to teach network analysis, signal processing,
   module-oriented design, and mathematical modeling to students of all
   disciplines. Enrollment included students from different disciplines
   ranging from computer science to psychology. In their final projects,
   students presented novel ways of approaching classic disciplinary
   problems.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of prospective
   science teachers at Sultan Qaboos University towards and their views
   about using journal writing in the Methods of Teaching Science course.
   Twenty-six prospective science teachers were asked to write about each
   topic in the course in their journal to show their understanding of it.
   In addition, they were asked to reflect on that topic. Two research
   instruments were used to collect the data; a scale of attitudes towards
   using the journal in the course and a focus group discussion. The
   attitude scale consisted of 29 items and its reliability coefficient was
   calculated by internal consistency using Cronbach's Alpha, which gave a
   value of 0.91. The focus group discussion was conducted with eight
   prospective science teachers. Both instruments were applied at the end
   of the course. The results of the study showed that prospective science
   teachers have a positive attitude towards using journal writing in the
   ``Methods of Teaching Science{''} course. They cited several advantages
   and benefits they gained from using the journal. They are also willing
   to use the tool when they become teachers of science in schools after
   graduation. However, they highlighted some points for improving the tool
   in future, such as giving them examples from previous works and more
   feedback from the instructor. Several recommendations are proposed to
   enhance the use of journal writing in ``Methods of Teaching Science{''}
   courses.},

Abstract = {This study explored pre-service teachers' conceptual understanding and
   performance on science process skills. A sample comprised 91 elementary
   pre-service teachers at a university in the Midwest of the USA.
   Participants were enrolled in two science education courses;
   introductory science teaching methods course and advanced science
   methods course. Data were collected through a questionnaire. Results
   showed that pre-service teachers had limited conceptual understanding of
   science process skills. On the other hand, they had higher performance
   on the science process skills. Whilst majority of the participants were
   unable to provide correct definitions of the science process skills,
   they performed well on the test that involved novel situations of the
   process skills. The findings have implications for science teaching,
   learning and teacher education.},

Abstract = {Group discussions were introduced in an introductory physics course at
   the National University of Laos. About 200 students discussed two
   qualitative questions in groups of 3-4 students. This was followed by
   whole class discussions. We examined this new method and identified
   problems and possibilities with it. Seven groups were recorded and
   students and teachers were interviewed. Findings indicate that many
   students had problems with mechanics concepts. In the group discussions
   most students co-constructed an answer. However, the students in general
   did not seem to come to an understanding of the physics concepts, and in
   class follow-up discussion proved to be an essential tool for a better
   understanding. To improve the discussions, the students need more time
   and should also be informed about the essentials of working in groups.},

Abstract = {The sustainable management of natural resources requires a thorough
   analysis of the land-use and forest cover dynamics and the effective
   factors in the changes occurring in them. This study investigated the
   roles played by social factors in the temporal changes in land cover and
   deforestation within the Torul State Forest Enterprise in northeastern
   Turkey. Between 2005 and 2016, this area was examined in terms of forest
   crime, demographic movement and forest dynamics using the Geographic
   Information System (GIS). Major changes were observed in the temporal
   dynamics of the forested areas and their parameters, with an overall net
   increase of 3.26\%. There was a productive forest area increase of
   16.459 ha. Regenerated-young stand areas had increased because of the
   regeneration activities carried out over the period. This was partially
   due to decreased forest crime, decreased rural population and increased
   gross national product (GNP), which had been below Turkey's average.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to examine the learning styles of
   prospective teachers in terms of emotional intelligence with some other
   variables. Grasha-Reichmann's learning style scale prepared by
   Grasha-Reichmann (1994) and Turkish version of which was adapted by
   Saritas and Sural (2010) was used to measure the learning styles of
   students who are candidates to become teachers. Their emotional
   intelligence was measured using this scale. The study group of the
   research composed of 406 university teacher candidates who were studying
   in the Education faculty in the academic year of 2016/2017. The research
   was carried out using the relational screening model. A significant
   relationship between subscales of learning styles and emotional
   intelligence sub-dimensions was found. In addition, significant
   differences were found in the dependent learning style and participative
   learning style sub-dimensions of learning styles according to the
   genders of teacher candidates. A significant level of differentiation
   was seen in the independent learning style, dependent learning style,
   competitive learning style and avoidant learning style sub-dimensions.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the social and emotional learning scale developed by
   Coelho, Sousa and Marchante in the English language aimed at determining
   the social and emotional learning competencies of students (2015) has
   been adapted into Turkish. The study also investigates the reliability
   and validity of the scale. The sample of the research consisted of 534
   students - 300 female and 234 male who were enrolled in secondary
   science education schools under the Ministry of National Education of
   Northern Cyprus. The statistical package programmes were used in
   statistical analysis of the data obtained from the research
   questionnaire. The normality of the distribution of scores obtained from
   social and emotional learning competencies was calculated using the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests, which were also used to
   calculate the QQ plot graph and skewness-kurtosis coefficients of the
   scores Accordingly, the Social and Emotional Learning Competencies
   Coefficient adapted to Turkish consists of 26 items in total, in which
   there five items in the social awareness sub-dimension, five items in
   the social isolation sub-dimension, seven items in the self-control
   sub-dimension, four items in the social anxiety sub-dimension and five
   items in the establishing relationships sub-dimension.},

Abstract = {Sales Promotion has been the routine marketing of businesses appealing
   consumers to making orders and increasing media exposure in recent
   years. Sales Promotion is a tactic for the sales of goods with price or
   non-price discounts. There are various sales promotions in the market,
   but not all of them are effective in marketing, as brand image,
   perceived value, and purchase intention are also associated. Sales
   Promotion therefore has become a primary issue for marketing. Aiming at
   2014 Kaohsiung International Travel Fair, 1000 copies of questionnaires
   are distributed to the customers, and 421 valid copies are retrieved,
   with the retrieval rate 42\%. The research results present the
   significant correlations between 1. Sales Promotion and Consumer
   Involvement, 2. Consumer Involvement and Purchase Intention, and 3.
   Sales Promotion and Purchase Intention.},

Abstract = {Construction industry has been criticized as the industry producing high
   pollution. Especially, a newly built house is often torn down and
   renovated the walls in the interior space at the life cycle stage of a
   housing project when buyers are using and maintaining, due to distinct
   customer demand and preference. Structural walls and beam columns are
   even randomly drilled for the piping requirement of air conditioner
   pipelines to result in public danger. It could be attributed to the
   regulation of interior environmental decoration without safety check in
   Taiwan and some interior designers, in order to strive for cases in the
   high competition, corresponding to customers' demands for changing
   interior patterns. In addition to newly built houses, the sale and
   transfer of second-hand houses is another thought for the renovation
   work of interior space environmental decoration to disturb the life of
   neighbors and seriously damage the environment. Accordingly, Delphi
   method, Analytical hierarchy process, and Utility theory are applied in
   this study to establish an AHP expected utility based evaluation model
   for management performance on interior environmental decoration, aiming
   to provide the safety management for interior environmental decoration
   and reduce the management review for energy consumption and
   environmental protection.},

Abstract = {The reform of teaching and physical quality of university students is
   the hope of the future, university life is the period for their body and
   mind to get the comprehensive development. Students only have the good
   physical quality, can be energetic to study. In order to better promote
   students' physical and mental development, physical education is set in
   higher schools to promote the health of students and improve the
   physical quality of students. At present, the reform of physical
   education in China is carried out for the development of students'
   physique. This paper analyzes the causes of decreased physical quality
   of contemporary university students, suggestion are proposed through
   changing the traditional concept of education, reforming university
   physical education, improving the school sports facilities and
   conditions to constantly improve the level of students' mental health,
   and provide the theoretical reference for optimizing the physical
   education quality and enhance the physical health of university
   students. Students' health consists of two aspects: physical and
   psychological aspects. In order to improve the students' self-confidence
   and willpower and adjust the mental state of students through sports,
   especially in the teaching of physical education, only paying attention
   to teaching sports skills and ignoring the health and education of
   university students should be prevented. During the process of physical
   exercise, university students should not only master the basic motor
   skills, but also develop the psychological quality. Teachers need to
   take some special measures to promote university students' mental health
   according to the psychological characteristics and physical
   characteristics of university students.},

Abstract = {This article develops a model of real option game to analyze effect of
   asymmetric government subsidy on the investment thresholds of private
   investors who compete with each other in the same market with uncertain
   price. The optimal investment thresholds of innovator and imitator are
   derived, and the effects of some key variables, such as inflation rate,
   interest rate, and degree of intellectual property protection, on those
   thresholds were analyzed. With the help of our model and a numerical
   example of sewage treatment industry, we demonstrate that subsidy to
   both innovator and imitator reduces optimal investment thresholds, while
   subsidy only to innovator raises the investment thresholds rather than
   reducing them. Based on the results of our study, we suggest that the
   government should offer subsidy to both of innovator and imitator
   indiscriminately, raise the overall level of IP protection, and reduce
   the financial cost for private investors in order to motivate them to
   invest in PPP projects.},

Abstract = {The macro-financial structure risk is an important part of financial
   risks. This paper constructs the sub-indices of foreign financial assets
   risks, monetary liquidity risks and mismatch structure risks for
   integration into the macro-financial structure risk index according to
   the index principle. The data of related indicators from January 2007 to
   April 2015 of China are collected for measuring each sub-index and their
   subsequent summarization into the total index of the macro-financial
   structure risk, and the trends of each sub-index and the total index are
   analyzed. After that, statistical tests and practical analysis are
   conducted to study the effectiveness, sensitivity and relevance of the
   macro-financial structure risk index. The practical analysis of the
   index shows that the macro-financial structure risks of China are on the
   rise, with prominent tendency characteristics, that the characteristics
   of each sub-index and their impact on the macro-financial structure
   risks are different, that the macro-financial structure risk index can
   be expected to play a leading role for predicting the macro economy and
   that the sub-indices are correlated to the total index to different
   degrees, despite their common action effects.},

Abstract = {Objective: Education undergoes constantly reform and school education
   also constantly makes progress, however, presently many schools have
   omissions in fostering students' practical ability, causing extremes in
   polarization of theory and practice after graduating. Practical ability
   is an important ability in physical education major, and so its
   cultivation study is very necessary. Research method: in this paper,
   literature consultation, questionnaire survey, mathematical statistics,
   logistic analysis and interviewing are applied to investigate
   systematically on fostering our school's physical education major
   students' practical ability from Grade 2013 to 2016. Research process:
   Finding issues in students' cultivation process through parsing how
   school fosters practical ability of students in physical education
   major, what about students' mastering level on practical ability, and
   then making analysis of the issues and putting forward suggestions.
   Result shows that students in physical education major are weak in
   practical ability, with a main reflection of general practical ability,
   physical education ability, sports race organization ability,
   extracurricular activity ability, sports training ability and scientific
   research ability. Suggestions: We should strengthen sports knowledge and
   skills' practical teaching, organization on sports race, construction of
   external-campus practice base, guidance on working out thesis; school
   should make proper adjustment on physical education talents cultivation
   plan in accordance with realistic social conditions.},

Abstract = {The pace of the development of contemporary science and technology is
   accelerating, and the multimedia assisted instruction technology with
   computer as the core has become an indispensable teaching means in
   higher vocational colleges (HVCs), and also an important mark of
   educational reform in HVCs in China. The development of modern network
   technology provides a strong impetus to the teaching reform in HVCs.
   This paper analyzes the research status of modern network technology
   application in domestic and overseas higher vocational education (HVE).
   It was found that the research on the application of modern network
   technology in HVE in China has a certain gap with that in overseas
   countries, especially the developed countries. Meanwhile, problems also
   exist that multimedia technology is too backward, the quality of CAI
   courseware cannot be guaranteed, and the interaction between teachers
   and students lacks, etc. Focusing on these problems, we suggest the
   following measures. First, vigorously strengthening the construction of
   campus information environment, establishing strict introduction and
   management systems of network facilities, strengthening the construction
   requirements of software teachers, and enhancing the propaganda of
   modern network technology. Second, integrating information technology
   with curriculum teaching, focusing on the inspection and verification of
   theoretical knowledge and application results, and improving the effect
   of students' knowledge acquisition. Third, enhancing the modernization
   of teaching technology in HVE, improving the memory effect of students'
   knowledge, thus arousing the enthusiasm of learning and teaching
   enthusiasm, and solving the lack of interaction between teachers and
   students, through the service function provided by network information
   technology. The starting point of optimizing the atmosphere of teaching
   activities in HVC is from these three aspects. Improve the application
   level of modern network technology in higher vocational teaching
   activities in China, and establish the application strategy of modern
   network technology in higher vocational teaching activities.},

Abstract = {With the rise and development of various media, more and more people
   have become the audience affected by the media. The influence of media
   on people's life is more and more extensive, especially for young
   people, the influence is more profound and lasting. At present, the
   multimedia technology has been applied to the vast majority of college
   teaching, but the application in the teaching of physical education is
   still in the exploration and practice stage. This paper analyzes the
   significance of multimedia technology applied in college sports teaching
   from different aspects, and it believes that the application of
   multimedia technology in college sports teaching not only helps to
   improve teaching quality and cultivate students interested in sports,
   but also improve teachers' occupation accomplishment. We should use the
   influential of media platform, to arouse public concern on the situation
   of college sports, to improve the students' enthusiasm for sports, and
   promote the college sports education and the healthy development of

Abstract = {Listening is highly critical as it is the first skill that is acquired
   from birth. However, this skill can be developed if it is acquired
   through proper methods and approaches. The purpose of this study is to
   identify whether technology-assisted context-based teaching improves the
   listening skills of teacher candidates. The research was based on a
   mixed research approach where quantitative data were obtained through
   experimental study and qualitative data were obtained through
   interviews. The study group of the research consisted of 50 teacher
   candidates in total; - 25 in the experimental group and 25 in the
   control group - who took the Comprehension Techniques II: Listening
   Education course in the Turkish Language Teaching department of Near
   East University in Northern Cyprus during the 2016-2017 academic year.
   The topics were conveyed to the experimental group using a context-based
   approach with technology-assisted context-based teaching, meaning the
   digital stories and drama method. A traditional method and approach was
   applied to the control group. ``Listening Success Tests{''} and
   ``Student interview forms{''} developed by the researchers were used for
   data collection. The obtained quantitative data were analysed using the
   Mann-Whitney U test, while qualitative data were analysed through
   content analysis. As a result of the findings obtained in the listening
   success tests, it was seen that there was a significant difference
   between the experimental group on which technology-assisted
   context-based teaching was applied and the control group where
   traditional teaching was used. Thus, it was proved that this approach
   applied to the experimental group was highly beneficial for developing
   the listening skills of the teacher candidates. Additionally, based on
   the opinions of the teacher candidates, it was revealed that this
   approach improved the listening skills from several perspectives.},

Abstract = {Previous research identified a strong correlation between mathematics
   and science performance albeit for small samples of students. Even
   though there was a high correlation between mathematics and science
   performance, researchers examining students' STEM achievement
   investigated mathematics and science achievement separately. The present
   study brings science and mathematics objectives together to constitute a
   higher order STEM assessment model. Data (science and mathematics
   scores) were gathered from 231,966 students (52\% female) who were in
   11th grade and took the state mandated test in 2013. A second-order
   confirmatory factor analysis was used to create a STEM assessment model.
   The fit indices showed indicated it was an adequate model fit for the
   data. However, the lack of assessments of technology and engineering
   objectives taught in K-12 make estimating the effectiveness of STEM
   teaching and learning tenable at best.},

Abstract = {Science standards of different countries introduced disciplinary core
   ideas and crosscutting concepts-such as energy-to help students develop
   a more interconnected science understanding. As previous research has
   mostly addressed energy learning in specific disciplinary contexts, this
   study targets students' cross-disciplinary understanding of energy.
   Since no respective test instrument was available, we present the
   development and validation of an instrument that can be used to compare
   students' progressing energy understanding across contexts from biology,
   chemistry, and physics. In a cross-sectional study, we administered the
   new instrument to N = 752 students at the end of grades 6, 8, and 10. In
   addition to a detailed discussion of the instrument's reliability and
   validity, the study findings compare progressing energy understanding in
   the three disciplinary contexts. With regard to energy as a crosscutting
   concept, the results are then used to discuss how students' energy
   understanding may be connected across disciplinary boundaries.},

Abstract = {In m-learning environments, context-awareness is for wide use where
   learners' situations are varied, dynamic and unpredictable. We are
   facing the challenge of requirements of both generality and depth in
   generating and processing high-level context. In this paper, we present
   a social approach which exploits social dynamics and social computing
   for generating high-level context. It is a novel and generic paradigm
   where the crowds of learners in m-learning environments directly engage
   in creating contents about high-level context and interactions by social
   tagging, and these contents and interactions are further explored to
   discover more implicit and complex high-level contextual information. We
   present the concept model, the context representation, the context
   matrix, and the context retrieval method. We evaluate our approach by a
   social simulation based experiment. The experimental results demonstrate
   that the context retrieval performance is improved in both the accuracy
   and the diversity, and validate that the proposed social approach is
   effective for generating high-level context.},

   prepared test questions on the university calculus topic of ``finding
   the area by integration.{''} The quiz is divided into two types of
   multiple choice items (one out of four and one out of many). After the
   calculus course was taught and tested, the results revealed that the Q
   matrix of the second type of multiple choice items (one out of many) is
   closer to that of the experts compared with that of the first type of
   multiple choice items (one out of four). The statistical information was
   then analyzed using Bayesian probability analysis methods to establish
   the ``find the area by integration{''} unit model as an example of a
   Bayesian network adaptive diagnostic test system and to establish how
   this structure could be used as the foundation for developing remedial

Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to investigate the main factors influencing the
   adoption and continuous utilization of statistical software among
   university social sciences students in Slovenia. Based on the Technology
   Acceptance Model (TAM), a conceptual model was derived where five
   external variables were taken into account: statistical software
   self-efficacy, computer attitude, statistics anxiety, statistics
   learning self-efficacy, and statistics learning value. The model was
   applied to the purposive sample of 387 university social sciences
   students in Slovenia who have been introduced to IBM SPSS Statistics
   during statistics courses. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation
   Modeling (SEM). The results indicated that all external variables
   considered in the model directly or indirectly affect the behavioural
   intention to use statistical software and are therefore relevant for our
   study. The most influential factors are found to be statistics anxiety
   and statistics learning value. The latter one plays a central role in
   our extended TAM, as its impact is stronger when compared with other
   external variables. The findings from our empirical study are useful for
   statistics educators. The recommendations proposed can improve the
   educational process in order to strengthen students' attitudes towards
   statistics and to decrease the level of statistics anxiety.},

Abstract = {The beliefs of teacher regarding their students' learning in mathematics
   are an essential factor due to their importance in developing a
   desirable mathematics classroom culture. The purpose of this study is to
   investigate the mutual relationship between the construction of
   sociomathematical norms in classroom mathematical culture and teachers'
   beliefs. We observed 13 sessions of a fourth grade elementary
   mathematics class for two periods totaling one year, and conducted
   interviews with the elementary teacher and students who participated in
   this study. The study results revealed that the mathematical belief of
   the elementary school teacher was reflected in the decision making for
   mathematics instruction, and greatly influenced the purpose, contents
   and methods of the mathematics class, which contributed to creating
   sociomathematical norms, or repeated patterns appearing between the
   teacher and students.},

Abstract = {The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine prospective teachers'
   mathematics teaching efficacy belief during their enrollment in teacher
   education program and at the end of their first year of teaching. In
   addition, the factors that enhance or inhibit participants' efficacy
   belief and how these factors affect their mathematics teaching efficacy
   when they become inservice teacher were investigated. Mixed research
   design was used in which data were collected through longitudinal survey
   and electronic interviews. Findings revealed that prospective teachers'
   mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs increase during their enrollment
   in teacher education program but decrease during their first year of
   teaching. In addition classroom management, communicating with student,
   communicating with parents, mathematical knowledge for teaching,
   material usage, and textbook usage are the factors that enhance or
   inhibit teachers' efficacy beliefs during their first year of teaching.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether a Role Play Game (RPG) with embedded
   geological contents and students' anticipation of an upcoming posttest
   significantly affect high school students' achievements of and attitudes
   toward geology. The participants of the study were comprised of 202 high
   school students, 103 males and 99 females. The students were divided
   into four groups: 1. RPG group with pre-announced posttest, 2. RPG group
   with unannounced posttest, 3. No RPG group with pre-announced posttest,
   and 4. No RPG group with unannounced posttest. A 2x2 MANCOVA was
   conducted on the posttest scores with students' pretest scores as the
   covariates. The results indicated that: (a) there was no statistically
   significant interaction effect between RPG and anticipation of posttest
   on students' learning outcomes; (b) there was no statistically
   significant main effect for RPG on students' learning outcomes; however,
   (c) whether or not students had anticipated an upcoming posttest
   significantly affected their geological achievements and attitudes. In
   conclusion, testing has positive effects as a reinforcement to help
   students both retain their content knowledge and have positive attitudes
   towards geology.},

Abstract = {A group of teacher educators and practitioners in mathematics education
   and early childhood education generalized a set of inquiry-based
   mathematics models for Taiwanese young children of ages 3-6 and designed
   a series of inquiry-based mathematics curriculum tasks in cultivate the
   children's diverse mathematical concepts and mathematical power. In this
   paper, we mapped the blueprint of the whole curriculum with a brief
   section of ``number{''} activities. We also compared this inquiry-based
   curriculum and instruction with the traditional mathematics teaching
   process in practical settings through a teaching experiment process, in
   which young children's mathematical learning performances were collected
   and analyzed as empirical evidence. Reflecting on the outcomes of this
   comparison, we presented exploratory findings of teaching experiments,
   and proposed relevant discussion for future works.},

Abstract = {This survey study examines an assessment methodology through e-quizzes
   administered at a military vocational college and subsequent student
   perceptions in spring 2013 at the ``Computer Networks{''} course. A
   total of 30 Computer Technologies and 261 Electronic and Communication
   Technologies students took three e-quizzes. Data were gathered via an
   online questionnaire. A model derived from Technology Acceptance Model 2
   (TAM2) was proposed to examine perceptions about the e-assessment
   system. A structural equation modeling analysis employed to examine
   relationships among age, type of high school student graduated from,
   computer ownership, course grade, technological complexity, content of
   questions in online quizzes, perceived usefulness and intention to use.
   Also, content analysis was performed on qualitative data. Results showed
   that perceptions about question contents significantly affected
   perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness had great influence on
   behavioral intention - substantiating the TAM literature. Student
   perceptions were neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic
   qualitatively. All in all, students appear to require training about
   e-assessment to benefit from it. The overall implication is that to
   boost use of e-quizzes, it is imperative to help students recognize the
   e-quizzes are useful for themselves.},

Abstract = {Science education reform emphasizes innovative and constructivist views
   of science teaching and learning that promotes active learning
   environments, dynamic instructions, and authentic science experiments.
   Technology-based and hands-on instructional designs are among innovative
   science teaching and learning methods. Research shows that these two
   types of instructional methods designed with constructivist views of
   science are more beneficial for students in learning science concepts
   when compared to traditional science instruction. However, the
   comparison of effectiveness of the two approaches as well as their
   affordances has not been clearly addressed. This paper presents a case
   study comparing the effectiveness of computer-based versus hands-on
   instructional activity on learning electric circuits. The results show
   that both approaches significantly improved pre-service mathematics and
   science teachers' learning of electric circuits. The two types of
   instructional activities did not significantly differ from each other in
   terms of learning gains. However, hands-on activity provided ample
   opportunities for group interaction as well as task-related discussions.
   This study shows that both computer-based and hands-on activities can be
   effective when utilized in the right classroom environment.},

Abstract = {FATIH project (Movement of Enhancing Opportunities and Improving
   Technology) is an information and communication technologies (ICT)
   project to promote social justice for all schools in Turkey. The
   educational movements and reforms in Turkish Educational System (TES)
   are not new but this project has a purpose to integrate the newest
   technologies into school curriculum nationwide. This study aims to
   explore how the FATIH project ensures social justice in the context of
   education. In order to achieve the goal, quantitative data is collected
   on teachers' views. The data is consisted of survey responses from
   teachers who practically involve in the project. The theoretical
   framework of the study was built on Cribb and Gewirtz' (2003) social
   justice perspectives which presents distributive, cultural and
   associational justice. The finding of the study shows that the teachers
   have hope that the project will overcome some injustice issues in TES
   but there are new injustice appearing with the project as well.},

Abstract = {Imagining is the first step in actualizing something. Several
   technological developments have been the product of people's dreams.
   This study discusses the results of a workshop related to dreaming about
   what e-learning will be like in the future that was part of an
   in-service training course included in the European Union Lifelong
   Learning program. The purpose of the current study is to shed light on
   the workshop participants' visions of the future of e-learning. The
   participants emphasized that e-learning will not only develop toward
   technology but also lead to pedagogical outputs. It was predicted that
   e-learning will contribute to education as blended learning and lifelong
   learning become popular. Other leading issues will be the integration of
   technology with the human body and the facilitation of learning. The
   author of the current study, who took part in the workshop, emphasized
   cloud-based technologies. Workshop participants stated that cloud-based
   services will inevitably become part of fields such as information
   security storage and estate services, as well as education. Moreover,
   they predicted that information and education clouds will emerge that
   can be accessed anywhere and anytime, and that these clouds will be used
   at all grade levels through facilitation by moderators on a local and a
   national basis. They also mentioned that the concept of e-learning will
   evolve into cloud-based learning.},

Abstract = {This study explored the factors that influenced the understanding of
   good mathematics teaching. A mixed methodology was used investigate the
   beliefs of beginning secondary teachers on good mathematics teaching.
   The two research instruments used in this study were the survey
   questionnaire and an interview. Beginning teachers selected Immediate
   Classroom Situation, Mathematical Beliefs, Pedagogical Content
   Knowledge, and Colleagues as the top four factors from the survey
   analysis that influenced their understanding of good mathematics
   teaching. The study's results have implications on investigating
   specific mathematical content knowledge that is important for classroom
   instruction at the secondary level. Furthermore, this study can be used
   as a reference for teacher education programs to improve the
   effectiveness of the pedagogical courses in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {This study explored the impact of explicit instruction on
   argumentation-based pedagogy, coupled with modelling and hands-on
   learning activities on pre-service physics teachers' perceived
   self-efficacy to teach science through argumentation. Participants
   consisted of 24 pre-service physics teachers attending an established
   teacher education program at a Turkish university. The results showed
   that the intervention had a positive impact on participants'
   self-efficacy to teach science through argumentation. More specifically,
   pre-service teachers who participated in this study: 1) viewed
   argumentation as a pedagogical tool that can help students to engage in
   meaningful learning, 2) reported high self-efficacy to teach science
   through argumentation and 3) indicated high motivation to teach science
   through argumentation in their future classrooms. In spite of these
   positive outcomes, participants shared their hesitations to teach
   science through argumentation as well. The implications of these
   findings for teacher education, teacher induction and future research
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {The effect of different textual versions (macroscopic (control),
   submicroscopic, and guided imagery) of the explanation of a chemical
   phenomenon on students' submicroscopic explanation of a related
   phenomenon was examined. The sample included 152 pre-service science
   teachers. The three textual versions of the explanation were distributed
   randomly to the participants. The results revealed that students who
   received the submicroscopic version and those who received the guided
   imagery version outperformed students who received the macroscopic
   version. These results indicated that students' use of the
   submicroscopic understanding was not spontaneous and they needed to be
   cued to do so. Also, the submicroscopic mean scores of all three groups
   were low, and this might be an indication of a weak ability to: 1)
   translate between macroscopic and submicroscopic levels of chemistry,
   and 2) transfer a submicroscopic understanding of one phenomenon to
   another related one.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research, conducted in a science methods course in
   Turkey, was to explore the qualities of hands-on science activities
   which might motivate preservice kindergarten teachers to use these
   activities in their own classrooms. Two similar classes totaling 47
   students and taught by the same instructor were used in this study. On
   surveys filled out at the end of the course, students rated course
   activities as fun, interesting, and high in learning and identified
   which activities they were likely to use in their own classrooms.
   Results indicated that student ratings of activities as fun,
   interesting, and high in learning were highly correlated and that
   students rated the activities they expected to use in the classroom
   significantly higher in fun, interest, and learning than the activities
   they did not intend to use. Implications for teaching science methods
   courses are discussed.},

Abstract = {The following interview was conducted with Professor David Hestenes in
   Gazimagusa, North Cyprus on March 23, 2009 during his visit for
   attending the Frontiers in Science Education Research Conference. He has
   served the physics education community since late 70s. He is most
   notably known by the project he led named the Modeling Instruction.
   Also, the Force Concept Inventory (FCI for short) is a very well-known
   tool for diagnosing student misconceptions in introductory mechanics. He
   alone and within his research groups, throughout the many decades, drew
   attention to the ways of conducting rigorous physics education research
   and contributing to the improvement of physics teaching and learning.
   Thanks to his leadership combined with the finest of the scholarship in
   the field, we now know much more than we did in the past. At the end of
   this paper, a list of Professor Hestenes' related publications is given
   for the readers' convenience.},

Abstract = {The current article about pre-service teachers (n=60) describes the
   implementation and evaluation of an innovative curriculum for teaching
   sound, waves and communication systems (SWCS). The study sought to
   investigate pre-service teachers' successes and difficulties in learning
   a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) based program,
   to examine the program's influence on students' interest and self
   efficacy beliefs about learning science and technology, and to explore
   the factors that affected their achievements and motivation. The
   participants were two groups of pre-service teachers who learned the
   course within their studies towards a B.Ed. degree in science teaching.
   Quantitative and qualitative data were collected by a final exam, a
   retention exam, a Motivation Questionnaire, final projects, class
   observations and interviews with the students. The findings revealed
   that the pre-service teachers successfully learned the new subject and
   were motivated in learning the course. The integration of science and
   technology studies, engaging the students in hands-on lab work and the
   use of ICT tools played a crucial role in promoting meaningful learning.
   However, the PBL part of the course contributed relatively little
   because the learners encountered difficulties in learning new subjects
   independently.},

Title = {The Development of Two High School Students' Discourses on Geometric
   Translation in Relation to the Teacher's Discourse in the Classroom},

Abstract = {Research exploring student development on geometric translation in
   relation to classroom teaching is scarce. We used a qualitative case
   study design and examined two students' development of thinking on
   translation in relation to the teacher's discourse in a Turkish high
   school classroom through a discursive framework. We examined the
   teacher's discourse through the video-taped classroom session in which
   he talked about translation. We examined the students' discursive
   development through three video-taped task-based interviews. Finally, we
   compared the students' discourses on translation with the teacher's
   discourse. The teacher's discourse on translation in the classroom was
   formal and based on an algebraic realization of the concept as an
   addition and a geometric transformation. The students adopted particular
   discursive elements used by the teacher right after instruction but
   later abandoned some of those and used their more established
   realizations of translation. The findings revealed the complexity of
   discursive development as the students continually and actively adjusted
   their discourses by taking into account the teacher's discourse while
   also making it compatible with their own realizations of translation. We
   conclude that socio-cultural and discursive approaches have the
   potential to shed additional light on issues regarding learning and
   teaching of geometric translation.},

Abstract = {A visual work of art carries various types of information on the context
   and period of its emergence. This information may be about the artist,
   the surrounding environment, society, and the theme of the work or all
   of these aspects. Besides, its mission of artistic existence, the work
   inherently transfers this information about the past. This inherent
   quality is sometimes referred to as the feature of documentation. The
   acceptance of artworks as documentation can be exemplified with the
   paintings of Venedician painters, which were used by experts to
   determine the rise in the sea water level of the city. Although
   documentation is one feature of art, the primary role of art is its
   societal mission, which suggests a translation of social problems into a
   universal artistic language. In this article, copper mining operated in
   Lefke region by Cyprus Mining Coporation (CMC) and its environmental
   effects are studied through the works of Inci Kansu. The purpose of
   reading the works is; to create an awareness of environmental pollution,
   also to it is also about reaching information about the time and
   conditions at the time of the event. For this purpose, the works of the
   artist on the subject will be read, interpreted, interpretation and
   judicial methods. All published article on the topic of the
   environmental pollution in Lefke region printed or verbal have been
   examined.},

Abstract = {Under the social pattern with gradual increase in consuming ability and
   the enhancement of the citizens' emphasis on leisure travel, the rapidly
   increasing outside dining has catering businesses move toward
   diversified brand management. The ratio of labor force employed in the
   relevant industries and catering industry in Taiwan in total labor force
   employed and the employment population are increasing. It becomes
   critical to promote the competitiveness of catering businesses through
   complete educational training systems. Aiming at the supervisors and
   employees of Wowprime Corp., total 500 copies of questionnaire are
   distributed and 384 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate
   77\%. The research results show significant correlations between 1.
   experiential education and elf-efficacy, 2. self-efficacy and
   organizational commitment, and 3. experiential education and
   organizational commitment. Eventually, suggestions are proposed,
   expecting to assist catering businesses in educating the employees,
   reducing costs for the enterprises, and enhancing the competitiveness.},

   the long-term development of school's infrastructure, it is also the
   main target for education reform, because all education activities were
   done with the education quality as the center. With the situation of
   increasing demand for high quality talents in our society, the scale of
   higher education has increased gradually, how to maintain the high
   quality and high level of higher education has become an urgent problem
   for ensuring the effectiveness of education. This paper based on EFQM
   model, combing with some constitute elements such as education content,
   responsibility allocation, management mode, resource distribution,
   research result and analysis improvement, analyzing the function need
   and performance requirement of the higher education quality assurance
   system, and designing of the system's general framework and process,
   constructing the model of higher education quality assurance system and

Abstract = {From the statistical data of World Tourism Organization on the number
   and average growth of travelers and the travel income, Asia-Pacific
   Region presents the best potential in tourism markets. A lot of visitors
   would choose to receive information through Word-of-Mouth when planning
   a tour. The Word-of-Mouth experiences and shared information could
   induce a visitor's travel demands. It therefore becomes a primary issue
   for the marketing in tourism industry to understand the function of
   Word-of-Mouth on a visitor's trust and employment of a tourism business
   brand. Taking EasyTravel as the research subject, the questionnaire
   survey is preceded through e-mails. With convenience sampling, total
   1000 copies of questionnaires are distributed to the web members of
   EasyTravel, and 382 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate
   38\%. The research results show the significantly positive correlations
   between 1. Word-of-Mouth and Brand Reliability in Brand Trust and 2.
   Word-of-Mouth and Brand Intention in Brand Trust; besides, 3.
   demographic variables reveal remarkable effects on the correlations
   between Word-of-Mouth and Brand Trust.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate how much Korean students
   recognize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and
   Mathematics) and to find out what keywords they associate with it and
   what the relationships among keywords mean. This study has surveyed
   1,009 middle school students by using the purposive sampling method. In
   order to achieve the goal of this study, we have developed a
   questionnaire in consultation with survey research experts. The
   questionnaire asks each student to write down three words that come to
   his or her mind in each area of study: S/T/E/A/M. The survey was
   conducted during the period between July and September, 2016, and the
   results were collected directly from the target groups. For data
   analysis, KrKwic was used for selecting top 30 keywords, and Ucinet6.0
   was employed to obtain meaningful relationships among keywords in the
   whole network. Then we built and visualized a network by using Netdraw.
   In this study the contents of analysis include the frequency of
   keywords, the network degree centralization index. The results of this
   study can be summarized as follows: First, the words students associate
   with science are ``experiment, chemistry, physics, scientist, biology,
   life, etc.{''} Second, the words students associate with technology are
   ``machine, home economics, robot, science,, invention, technician,
   etc.{''} Third, the words students associate with engineering are
   ``machine, technology, robot, computer, mechanical engineering, science,
   college of engineering, engineer, etc.{''} Fourth, the words students
   associate with the arts are ``art, music, painting, beauty, dancing,
   song, dance in Korean, etc.{''} Fifth, the words students associate with
   math are ``calculation, function, numbers, difficulty, equation,
   formula, etc.{''} Sixth, With regard to STEAM, middle school students
   recognize science as experiment, technology and engineering as machine,
   arts as art, math as calculation. Seventh, Each network of STEAM turns
   out to be a complicated one. It is difficult to find a meaningful
   creation of images due to their lack of learning experience in combined
   knowledge. This explains the need of learning experience in the STEAM
   programs. The fact that all of middle school students consider STEAM
   difficult supports this explanation.},

Abstract = {The cultivation of university students' healthy social emotion is a
   prerequisite for students to adapt to the new environment of social
   development, which is conducive to the overall improvement in university
   students' comprehensive quality. However, study on this subject is
   insufficient in the current relevant theoretical research which stays in
   shortcomings analysis, lacking theoretical verification of key means. To
   further improve the relevant theoretical work, this paper conducts
   linear regression empirical analysis based on analysis of traditional
   issues. The conditions influencing cultivation of university students'
   healthy social emotion was analyzed by regression model, and targeted
   study was conducted on shaping of students' healthy personality and
   cultivation of students' moral feelings. The three manifestations of
   university students' social emotions were then put forward. This paper
   proposes that efforts should be made to establish targeted cultivation
   path for university students' healthy social emotion by starting from
   shaping students' healthy personality and strengthening cultivation of
   students' moral feelings under the constraints in cultivation conditions
   of university students' healthy social emotions. In the process of
   cultivating university students' social emotion, we should integrate
   humanities education, real social environment, and apply interpersonal
   communication cultivation method, proceed from shaping students' moral
   feelings and healthy personality based on the current basic
   characteristics of university students' social emotion, explore the path
   to cultivate students' healthy social emotion and ensure healthy
   development of cultivate students' social emotion.},

Abstract = {Business Statistics is an important course for teaching administration
   and business colleges in colleges and universities. In most colleges and
   universities, traditional ``teaching{''} mode is till used in course
   teaching of business Statistics; the mode of interfered realization of
   course teaching goal in a certain extent. In this essay, current status
   and characteristics of course teaching of Business Statistics were
   sorted out with guidance of information age background. The study
   suggested that there were following problems in course teaching of
   Business Statistics: defects of teaching position,
   ``teaching-learning{''} was main mode, connection with practical demands
   was not close enough and etc. In the study, overall reform framework was
   proposed through content, method and evaluation of course teaching;
   ``Practical Business Statistics{''} was conducted and used; teaching
   reform mode with theories and practical teaching was formed which could
   provide reference for course teaching reform of Business Statistics in
   colleges and universities.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of the paper is to present some theoretical approaches
   and some methods providing assessment optimization in specialists'
   accreditation in area of public health services. The results of research
   presented in this paper, include the model of multistage adaptive
   measurements and two methods for reliability and validity analysis,
   providing high justice decisions in accreditation and corresponding to
   requirements in High-Stakes Testing procedures. The assessment
   optimization intends for minimization time of assessment and for
   reliability and validity data increasing. For optimization the special
   model of measurements based on multistage adaptive testing is offered.
   The using of offered model in assessment design allows to realize the
   advantages of traditional adaptive testing and linear testing, while
   minimizing their disadvantages. So, this model is recommended as
   dominating for assessment in accreditation. For validity increasing in
   assessment in accreditation the approach based on Structural Equation
   Modeling is offered. This method allows to analyze the significance of
   relations between observed and latent variables that have any
   interpretation as causal effects, and to construct the model of their
   relations. The example of model of casual relations between disciplines,
   latent variables (competencies) and factors is offered. The model helps
   to increase construct and content validity of measuring tool using in
   public health services accreditation. The methods of reliability
   estimation in multistage measurements, offered in paper, has innovative
   character. It has branching structure as the value of reliability in
   multistage measurements depends not only on reliability of separate
   stages, but also from correlations between them. The presented
   approaches allow to increase validity and reliability of decisions in
   public health services specialists' assessment or in other spheres of
   assessment during accreditation.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of organizational
   learning on employee's innovative behavior, and further proposed the
   mediation effect of work engagement between the relationship of
   organizational learning and employee's innovative behavior. The study
   targets on executives and their subordinates by paired samples within
   the Southern Taiwan Science Park and a total of 21 useful firms
   collected, including 54 managers and 511 employees, and to evaluate
   research model by using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The
   empirical results indicated that work engagement fully mediated the
   relationship between organizational learning and employee's innovative
   behavior, that is, executives with organizational learning can
   strengthen the work engagement of employees, thereby affecting
   employee's innovation behavior. Besides, we further found that work
   engagement also plays a full mediating role among organizational
   learning and employee's innovative ideas generation, advocacy, and
   implementation respectively. This paper suggests managers should take
   advantage of their learning culture to enhance their employees' work
   engagement and then this is also beneficial for the generation of
   innovative behavior of employees.},

Abstract = {Cross-grade studies are valuable for the development of sequential
   curriculum. However such studies are time and resource intensive and
   fail to provide a clear representation to integrate different levels of
   representational complexity. Lin (Lin, 2006; Lin \& Chiu, 2006; Lin,
   Chiu, \& Hsu, 2006) proposed a cladistics approach in conceptual
   evolution to construct a hypothetical Conceptual Evolution Tree (CET;
   also called Evolutionary Pathway of Student Mental Models) in electric
   circuits which overcome the limitations of earlier cross-grade studies.
   The aims of this study are to validate this hypothesis and to integrate
   with the CET graph to better understand Taiwanese students' conceptual
   evolution in electric circuits. This study uses a web-based mental model
   diagnosis system to collect 1,441 cross-grade students' data. The
   results show that the empirical cross-grade survey data closely meet the
   hypothesis. The CET graph in electric circuits well explains the
   relationship between student conceptual evolution from Grade 1 to 9 and
   the curriculum influences by comparing to the empirical data. The
   validated CET graph in electric circuits could be a useful tool for
   science educators in designing sequential curriculum content.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine the progression of
   exemplifying and example generalization by students. We investigated
   whether example generalization occurs by analyzing collected data by
   identifying whether students recognize, describe, and define general
   features of geometric examples. We also investigate how example
   generalization progresses by identifying students' use of abduction,
   induction, diagrams and deduction. As a result of this study, we
   revealed that the sub-mechanisms undertake the generalization of
   examples as supported by the coordination of abduction, induction,
   deduction, and the use of diagrams. We empirically confirmed
   generalization by students through exemplifying and found that their
   generalization of examples involved the coordination of abduction,
   induction, deduction, and the use of diagrams.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop a scoring rubric to assess primary
   school students' problem posing skills. The rubric including five
   dimensions namely solvability, reasonability, mathematical structure,
   context and language was used. The raters scored the students' problem
   posing skills both with and without the scoring rubric to test the
   reliability of the rubric. The study used generalizability theory to
   test the reliability of the scores obtained with and without the use of
   the rubric. More reliable scoring was obtained using the scoring rubric.
   The G and phi coefficients rose somewhat after increasing the number of
   items and raters in both scoring methods. However, increasing the number
   of items affected these coefficients slightly more than increasing the
   number of the raters.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to explore the current status of teachers'
   multicultural education literacy and multicultural curriculum practices,
   with a total of 274 elementary school science teachers from Taitung
   County as survey participants. The questionnaire used a Likert-type
   four-point scale which content included the teachers' perception of
   multicultural education literacy and their multicultural education
   curriculum practices. The primary findings were as follows: (1)
   Teachers' perception of multicultural education literacy reflected a
   highly positive and affirming attitude. (2) Teachers from various
   backgrounds did not demonstrate significant differences in their
   perception related to multicultural education literacy. (3) Teachers who
   graduated from junior teacher colleges, normal universities, or teacher
   colleges and those who teach natural sciences were more likely to place
   importance on multicultural concepts and practices in their curriculum.
   (4) Although teachers had a high level of perception related to
   multicultural education, there was still a gap in their ability to
   actually carry out multicultural teaching.},

Abstract = {The Russian and international legislation ensure equal educational
   rights to all people regardless of whether have a disability or not.
   However, traditional approaches to organization of educational
   activities often do not provide a high enough level of education
   (including higher education) for people with disabilities as they do not
   take into account their special needs. This significantly narrows down
   the scope of professional options for people with disabilities.
   Mathematical disciplines are among the most difficult to master which
   means that if people with disabilities are not provided with specific
   support it might cut them off from professional fields that require
   mathematical competence. This determines the relevance and importance of
   the present study. The main objective of our research is to identify
   features of effective teaching of mathematical subjects to bachelor
   students with disabilities. We specifically focus on the group of
   students with musculoskeletal disabilities as this type of disabilities
   is one of the most common. The main research method is expert assessment
   of teaching practices (within mathematical subjects) and evaluation of
   influential factors, effectiveness indicators and resources.
   Representatives of public organizations, ministries, psychologists (that
   specifically specialize in working with people with disabilities),
   representatives of higher education, employers and HR managers-all in
   all 95 people took part in the experiment.},

Abstract = {Tourism development could drive the enhancement of national income and
   the demands for international tourism that tourism benefits have become
   the key source of national revenue. The integration of cultural relics
   with tourism development to drive the national or regional development
   has currently become the world trend. Making good use of the integration
   of historic and cultural heritage with unique national characteristics
   and customs has become a major incentive to tourists. Aiming at Kinmen
   as the research target, the local residents are researched in this study
   to discuss the attitudes towards the development after the opening to
   tourism. Total 412 valid copies of questionnaire are retrieved, from
   which negative correlations appear between the residents' perception of
   tourism impact and attitudes towards the sustainable development of
   Kinmen; besides, the perception of tourism crowding would deepen the
   negative correlation between the perception of tourism impact and the
   attitudes towards the sustainable development. In this case, the
   government must solve the problem of tourism crowding by effectively
   dispersing tourism crowding.},

Abstract = {This paper applies data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic
   frontier analysis (SFA) to explore the relative efficiency of China's
   research universities of science and technology. According to the
   finding, when talent training is the only output, the efficiency of
   research universities of science and technology is far lower than that
   of comprehensive universities. However, when the outputs of scientific
   research and social service are taken into consideration, the former
   will increase remarkably and even exceeds the latter. Moreover, the
   research universities of science and technology have a higher inner
   homogeneity because their standard deviation of efficiency score is
   obviously lower. The study also reveals that the number of research
   universities of science and technology with redundant inputs is more
   than that of comprehensive universities. Beyond that, the environmental
   variables and statistical noise exert no significant effect on the
   efficiency of Chinese research universities.},

Abstract = {Science education reform in Qatar has had limited success. In the Trends
   in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS), Qatari 4th and
   8th grade students have shown progress in science achievement, but they
   remain significantly below the international average. Also, in the
   Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), Qatari students
   have shown progress in science achievement, but they are again below the
   international average. To gain insight into what factors limit the
   students' science achievement, the School Science Teaching Inventory
   Questionnaire (SSTIQ) was administered to science coordinators and
   teachers in 24 independent schools in Qatar. The questionnaire results,
   in conjunction with interviews, indicated that science coordinators and
   teachers believed that a set of factors was responsible, and that low
   student motivation was the factor that was most responsible. Low student
   motivation was due, in part, to textbooks being overemphasized, and
   inquiry-based and problem-based methods being underemphasized. Based on
   these findings, recommendations for improving students' science
   achievement were provided.},

Title = {Research on the Development of Middle School Mathematics Pre-service
   Teachers' Perceptions Regarding the Use of Technology in Teaching
   Mathematics},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the changes in teacher perceptions
   regarding the use of technology subsequent to the training about
   technology integration in mathematics teaching. A training program that
   included combined technology, pedagogy and content knowledge was
   prepared and implemented on pre-service teachers with this aim.
   Exploratory sequential mixed method, one of the mixed method designs
   that include qualitative and quantitative research techniques, was
   utilized in the study. While pretest-posttest experimental design with
   no control groups was used in the quantitative dimension of research,
   pre-service teachers' written views were collected during the
   qualitative part of the study. Study participants were 34 pre-service
   teachers attending Middle School Mathematics Teaching Department of a
   state university during the spring semester of 2013-2014 academic year.
   Perception Scale for Technology Use and interview forms were used as
   data collection tools. Descriptive statistical methods and t-test were
   utilized for analyzing quantitative data whereas content analysis was
   preferred for qualitative data. Research results presented that
   significant differences were identified in middle school mathematics
   pre-service teachers' perceptions regarding the use of technology as a
   result of the training related to technology integration in mathematics
   teaching. Based on the findings, it was concluded that trainings that
   incorporate technological, pedagogical and content knowledge that are
   provided during teacher training process develop pre-service teachers'
   perceptions related to the use of technology in mathematics teaching.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore how Korean preservice
   elementary teachers' beliefs about nature of science (NOS) and their
   beliefs about constructivist teaching were structured and related and if
   any relation was prevalent in the content-specific contexts. As the same
   format, three versions of questionnaires were developed in three
   different science content topics, using episodes about rival theories in
   the history of science and students' relevant alternative conceptions.
   The data analysis suggests that the content context can partially affect
   teachers' beliefs about NOS and their beliefs about constructivist
   teaching. Additionally, no significant correlation between beliefs about
   NOS and constructivist teaching was found.},

Abstract = {In this study it was aimed to determine pre-service primary teachers'
   knowledge structures of fraction through problem posing activities. A
   total of 90 pre-service primary teachers participated in this study. A
   problem posing test consisting of two questions was used and the
   participants were asked to generate as many as problems based on the
   following conditions: i) using both 1/2 and 3/4 fractions, and ii) using
   either 1/2 or 3/4 fractions. Data were analyzed using both semantic and
   constant comperative analysis techniques. The results of the study
   showed that there was substantial diversity in the problems posed by
   pre-service primary teachers. Moreover, participants preferred to pose
   story and symbolic equations in first task and story equation in second
   task. Furthermore, the participants faced some issues such as not
   realizing 1/2 + 3/4 situation is more than 1, missing data, choosing
   wrong number, using different fractions and posing non-fraction problem.},

Abstract = {In this paper, abstraction is associated with an activity in the sense
   of activity theory by Vygotsky. To him, participation in social
   activities is a fundamental act for the child in order to achieve higher
   mental functions. The present paper aimed to experimentally investigate
   the abstraction process and illustrate how meaning emerges on social
   plane from the perspective of theory of abstraction. The analysis is
   from a science classroom activity. The activity was videotaped,
   transcribed, and later translated into English. The results indicated
   that in a contextualizing action five central elements (Scene, Agent,
   Purpose, Act and Agency) played important role.},

Abstract = {Vee diagrams have been a metacognitive tool to help in learning the
   nature and structure of knowledge by reflecting on the scientific
   process and making knowledge much more explicit to learners during the
   practical work. This study aimed to assess pre-service science teachers.
   understanding some aspects of NOS by analyzing their reflections on the
   Vee diagrams constructed during the general biology laboratory course.
   In this single case study, elementary pre-service science teachers who
   cited mainly ``the cell theory{''} in their Vee diagrams while building
   around the cell concepts were asked to participate in focus group
   reflective interviews. These interviews compared the patterns of the
   nature of scientific knowledge to the ways their constructed the cell
   related concepts. The content analysis of transcripts revealed that
   pre-service teachers gained a superficial understanding of history of
   scientific ideas in the development of the cell biology, not a deeper
   epistemological understanding in conceptualizing a contemporary
   understanding of the aspects of NOS. The emergent categories of naive
   understandings and misconceptions held by the participants were
   demonstrated and discussed in the light of NOS related literature.},

   strategies, and student attitudes toward mathematical word problem
   solving among primary school students. The experimental group (N= 96)
   received the VStops approach in teaching and learning of mathematical
   word problem solving, while the control group (N= 97) received the
   conventional approach. Five instruments were used to collect the data:
   the achievement test, conceptual knowledge test, metacognitive awareness
   questionnaire, problem-solving strategies awareness questionnaire, and
   attitudes toward mathematical word problem- solving questionnaire. Pre
   and posttest data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance
   (MANOVA) followed by univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). Overall,
   the study found that the VStops approach had a positive impact on
   achievement, conceptual knowledge, metacognitive awareness, awareness of
   problem- solving strategies, and student attitudes toward mathematical
   word problem solving.},

Abstract = {This study situates the educational needs of pre-school educators based
   on the essential aspects of the Reggio Emilia approach. A total of 156
   pre-school educators agreed to participate in the study. The
   investigation combines both qualitative and quantitative research
   methods. The Reggio Emilia themed survey was conducted with the aim of
   gathering data on the educational needs related to the particular
   subject group. The survey consisted of two sections. The first part of
   the survey involved examining nine demographic factors, while the second
   part consisted of 49 Reggio Emilia based educational need items in
   total. All surveys were applied to the pre-school teachers' face-to-face
   in order to increase the reliability level of the research. In the
   survey, the opinions of the teachers were consulted in order to evaluate
   their needs in terms of the Reggio Emilia approach. Statistical analysis
   of the gathered data demonstrated that all teachers' have educational
   needs according to all of the determined dimensions of the approach. The
   dimensions included techniques, assessment and evaluation, tools and
   techniques and parental involvement in the survey. It was found that
   vocational seniority, vocational placement and family involvement
   matters affected the educational needs of the teachers' in various ways
   based on the approach.},

Abstract = {The submitted article supports the multidisciplinary approach to STEM
   (Science, Technology, Engineer, Mathematics) teaching. Pupils in many
   countries are showing a reduced interest in STEM studies. Should we wish
   to increase their interest in STEM studies, then we must increase their
   interest in the study of mathematics. This article concentrates on
   providing an illustrative demonstration of the interdisciplinary
   relations between mathematics and information and communication
   technology (ICT) that can readily be used in teaching these two subjects
   at primary and secondary schools. The interdisciplinary teaching
   approach described promotes not only a better understanding of the study
   of mathematics but it also develops pupils' logical reasoning and
   critical thinking. The need to interconnect mathematics and ICT in
   teaching is documented through specific examples. Attention is focused
   on number translation between individual numerical systems and entering
   numbers in the memories of computers and calculators.},

Abstract = {A comic book with rich picture and storyline, which needs to combine the
   storyboard creation and visual picture design. In the comic production
   process requires a lot of manpower and time cost to complete the work.
   This study presents an intelligent comic production system (ICPS) in
   which cartoons are subdivided into many design elements and integrated
   into the framework of Creative Design Resource Integration (CDRIM). By
   analyzing the creative requirements of cartoon scripts, ICPS
   reconstructs the new comic design elements and completes the new Comics.
   The comic design of the paper is to let the author use the text script

Abstract = {Started from the microbodies of real estate market, this paper supposed
   real estate price is mainly determined by the bodies' market behaviors
   and related interactions, while the demanders in real estate market are
   heterogeneous. and local government and central government are with
   different purposes in regulating the market. For these considerations
   above, this paper constructed a real estate price deterministic model,
   and conducted a numeric simulation. The main findings include: the price
   fluctuation of real estate market has chaotic characteristics, and the
   systematic parameters have a comparatively big effect on market
   equilibrium. The sensitivity that both consumption demanders and real
   estate developers have on real estate price is positively correlated to
   real estate market equilibrium. In the long term, the price of real
   estate market will be approaching to its actual value.},

Abstract = {There is no clear answer in academic world about whether to establish a
   social security system for migrant worker, and if doing so, whether it
   will influence the enterprises-competitiveness. Migrant worker has been
   contributing a lot for the urban construction, but it is also a
   vulnerable group, so the research in social security system for migrant
   worker is an inevitable problem. How to protect and guarantee the
   interests of the migrant workers become the social problem needed to be
   solved immediately nowadays. Based on the investigation about the
   situation of migrant worker's social insurance in Lanzhou and applying
   the Logistic regression model to analyze the influence factors of
   migrant worker's participation in social insurance in Lanzhou. This
   article proposes some suggestions about establishing a national
   electronic information files for migrant workers and transforming of the
   advertisement methods of the government.},

Abstract = {It is worthwhile to investigate abnormal performance of IPOs by
   incorporating investor sentiment. Using the method of Agent-based
   Computational Finance (ACF), we analyze the effect from different kinds
   of investor sentiment on IPOs first-day underpricing and long-term
   performance. The results show that individual investor's sentiment is
   positively correlated with the IPO's first-day underpricing and its
   long-run performance. In the long run, along with the rising of
   individual investor sentiment, IPOs' long-term performance will change
   from underperforming to outperforming. This conclusion provides a more
   reasonable explanation for the different IPOs long-term performance.},

Abstract = {With the recent technological advances, there is a shift from
   traditional education to tablet-assisted learning environment. This
   study compares the problems experienced by students in traditional
   education and tablet-assisted educational activities. The impact of
   traditional education on students has been discussed by a comprehensive
   analysis of the literature. The findings showed that the physical
   discomforts due to tablet-use are intensively experienced at neck, upper
   back, lower back, and shoulder regions, which are very similar to those
   experienced in traditional education. Reading and writing activities
   have impact on the shoulders, upper back, and the left upper arm. The
   developed risk assessment model has shown that both educational and
   extracurricular activities result in significant risk factors of
   physical discomfort. Analysis of the muscular activity data implied that
   there were significant differences among muscle groups for each
   respondent, which validates and verifies our risk assessment model.},

Abstract = {The imagination capability in technology commercialization is the key
   success factor for innovation. However, higher education in general and
   engineering-related curricula in particular, has offered limited courses
   incorporating imagination. A complete and well-verified curriculum that
   will enhance the imagination capability in technology commercialization
   is critical and imperative to resolve the problem. Thus, this research
   summarizes possible course modules and the criteria for evaluating and
   selecting the core modules based upon a literature review. Final
   criteria were defined by using the modified Delphi method. The influence
   relationships of each criterion on the others were derived by the
   Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). Subsequently,
   the derivation of critical criteria, a weight was defined for each
   criterion by using the DEMATEL-based Network Process (DNP). Finally, the
   correlations between the criteria and the course modules were derived by
   using the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). Based on the analytic results,
   QFD, TRIZ, and SCAMPER courses were recognized by the experts as
   important for enhancing engineering students' imagination capabilities.},

Abstract = {Maritime radar is the kernel sensor for tracking vessels in Vessel
   Traffic Service system, it is important for Maritime Situation
   Awareness. However, the images collected by the maritime radar are
   inundated with excessive noise blips, which bring variety of troubles in
   extraction of ship targets from the images. This paper proposes a radar
   target recognition method based on fuzzy C-means. First, the attributes
   of the blips in the sequential radar images, such as speed, direction
   and size, are quantified as three pieces of evidence to determine
   whether a radar blip is a moving vessel. Then, an artificial
   intelligence was built based on FCM. According to the three pieces of
   evidence, the possibility of a blip being a real vessel is computed with
   FCM. The main difficulty in building the FCM framework is to find an
   appropriate way to provide the classification coefficient C and the
   fuzzy coefficient m. Since the C in classification is finite, this study
   proposes a method to obtain C by assessing the Euclidean distance of the
   expected result. Since m is related to the discreteness of evidence and
   results, the coefficient can be assessed by Shannon entropy and gain.
   Field experiments suggest that the improved FCM is capable of
   classifying the radar blips accurately, and reducing the operational
   strength of the ship operators and improving the safety.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the study is due to the emergence of new
   Internet-addictive strategies of behavior among adolescents. The use of
   existing of psychodiagnostic of methods on revealing behavioral
   addictions children and adolescents from the virtual space does not give
   valid results. This leads to uncontrolled development in the teenage
   years mechanism of pathological addictive behavior on the basis of which
   can then easily be navigated to chemical addictions (smoking,
   alcoholism, drug addiction). Despite the seemingly harmlessness of
   internet addiction, they became the first step in the addiction
   personality and pose a threat to state security. The purpose of this
   article is to explore the possibilities of psychodiagnostics
   Internet-addictive behavior among pupils, as well as the need to update
   pedagogical prevention of addictive behavior in the educational
   environment. The leading method of the research is the analysis of
   psycho-pedagogical literature and legal acts in the field of prevention
   of addictive behavior, psychodiagnostic methods. In the article, there
   is an attempt to justify the need for increasing a conceptual model of
   coping prevention for all types of addictive behavior. It is shown that
   at the stage of pedagogical prevention it does not make sense to develop
   various programs of prevention of drug using, nicotine, smoking blends,
   alcohol, gaming and Internet addictions. The single purpose of
   preventive educational activities is the formation of adaptive coping
   strategies and coping resources of adolescents and young people that are
   at the heart of personality's resilience. Results of the study showed
   that the method for the diagnosis of Internet addiction does not detect
   those adolescents who already have symptoms of adaptation disorder. They
   were discovered by us on the basis of a study of strategies of coping
   behavior of pupils.},

Abstract = {The most dramatic factor shaping the future of higher education is Big
   Data and analytics. In the Big Data era, the explosive growth of massive
   data manipulations imposes a heavy burden on computation, storage, and
   communication in data centers. Increasing uncertainties in information
   system availability have become a daily serious problem. An appropriate
   evaluation and selection of the right information system disaster
   recovery (DR) site can ensure business continuity and investment
   optimization. However, most academic institutes always neglect the
   importance of DR. Not to mention the DR sites in the era of Big Data.
   Existing research results do not evaluate or select DR sites in general
   or those for academic Big Data applications in particular. Therefore,
   this research aims to establish an analytic framework for evaluating,
   selecting DR sites for academic Big Data. The proposed analytic
   framework is consisting of the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation
   Laboratory (DEMATEL), DEMATEL-based network process (DNP) and
   VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) methods. An empirical
   study based on a real Big Data DR application of an Asian
   high-performance computer center's evaluation and selection of DR sites
   for academic Big Data is used to illustrate the feasibility of the
   proposed framework. The analytic results can serve as a foundation for
   information technology administrators' strategies to reduce the
   performance gaps of a DR site for Big Data manipulations in general, and
   academic Big Data manipulations in special.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the research problem is reasoned by the need to develop
   conceptual approaches and technologies for designing educational
   curricula based on current and prospective order for specialists'
   training from educational services' consumers - regional entities of the
   labor market. The goal of the article lies in justification of the
   concepts and techniques of educational curricula designing that are
   based on joint activities of the University and employers to determine
   the needs in employees for the regional labor market; to formulate
   requirements on the basis of professional standards to the qualification
   characteristics of graduates; to develop the content of the basic
   professional educational curricula. Leading research methods for this
   problem were: pedagogical modeling and design, study of the
   universities' experience, questionnaires, pedagogical experiment, as
   well as methods of mathematical statistics, which allowed completely,
   explore the effectiveness of educational curricula design and carry out
   their correction taking into account the requirements of the regional
   labor market. The article reveals the concept and technology of
   educational curricula designing, including pre-project analysis;
   definition of design idea and construction of the curriculum concept;
   development of the content and main components of the curriculum and its
   testing; assessment of the design effectiveness. The role of the
   regional labor market's entities at different stages of high educational
   curriculum development is justified. The materials of the article can be
   useful for the universities' development of the basic professional
   educational curricula, the basic and optional parts' content of
   educational curricula; at curricula and projects' development in the
   sphere of professional education.},

Abstract = {The scientific integrity, perceptions of scientific misconduct, and
   students' needs in the research ethics education of Korean and Japanese
   gifted students were analyzed to address three questions. First, how
   well do students practice research ethics in their research? Second, how
   do students perceive scientists' misconduct? Third, do students want to
   learn research ethics and what aspects do they want to learn?
   Participants comprised 397 Korean and 370 Japanese science gifted high
   school students. Survey results showed that 48.92\% of Korean students
   and 14.86\% of Japanese students experienced scientific misconduct
   regarding their research. However, 90.61\% of Korean students and
   87.54\% of Japanese students could identify these behaviors are
   scientific misconducts. Only 32.94\% of Korean students and 19.63\% of
   Japanese students expressed a desire to learn about research ethics
   concepts and practical issues during research. Although professing
   knowledge about scientific integrity, their scientific misconduct
   demonstrates a lack of authentic understanding. Thus, there is a need to
   accurately present students with the training they need.},

Abstract = {Electronic Assessment (E-Assessment) also known as computer aided
   assessment for the purposes involving diagnostic, formative or summative
   examining using data analysis. Digital assessments come commonly from
   social, academic, and adaptive learning in machine readable forms to
   deliver the machine scoring function. To achieve real-time and smart
   e-assessment, data modeling needs dramatic improvements at the level of
   representation which will improve examinees to gain prompt response
   instantly after attempting exams. Whereas, computer based inference to
   gain intelligence in assessing results through computations is becoming
   a useful feature in todays' testing systems. Induction of rule base
   linked data is desired to be reformed from the old tradition data model
   found either in spread sheet or relational database used for data
   storage. These data forms are essential to be converted into semantical
   annotated form to support Artificial Intelligence. This can be done with
   the use of Semantic Web data model Resource Description Framework (RDF)
   built-up using hierarchal and linked data representation. Updating
   assessment source data later for results is one of the hardest problem
   of all viabilities in traditional and semantically augmented systems
   when combined for evaluating. This study purposes a methodology of
   bidirectional data transformation back and forth from Relational
   Database (RDB) and RDF. A case study representing qualitative analysis
   of transforming student's results information into RDF store reforming
   data as ready to be analyzed. At the end of this study outcomes show how
   data updating becomes feasible by following proposed data transformation
   procedure.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore physics teachers' ramification of
   theory and practices as a result of physics content and pedagogical
   changes in the Further Education and Training (FET) phase. The
   researchers adopted the mixed method research approach. The quantitative
   aspect involved 109 physics teachers and the qualitative approach used
   ten purposively selected grade 12 physics teachers in two districts in
   the Eastern Cape Province. Data was analysed via simple descriptive
   analysis and themes. The findings revealed that irrespective of teaching
   experience at a stage in the content changed period, physics teachers
   felt confused regarding what theories and policies are to be practised.
   It was demonstrated that current CAPS policies and theories are not
   followed but rather old theories and practices of NATED 550 often
   dominate in teaching and learning of physics content. The need to ensure
   science teaching develops active problem-solving learners through
   current policies, theories and practices in curriculum reformations
   seems not engulfed by the physics teachers.},

Abstract = {Background-This article reports contributions of an assessment tool
   called Portfolio of Evidence (PE) in learning college geometry.
   Material and methods-Two classes of second-year students from one
   Ethiopian teacher education college, assigned into Treatment and
   Comparison classes, were participated. The assessment tools used in the
   Treatment and Comparison classes were PE and paper-and-pencil,
   respectively. Data sources were scores of: Self-/Teacher-Assessment
   Rubric (STAR); Mathematical test measuring Skills, Properties, Uses, and
   Representations (SPUR); and Learning and Study Strategies Inventory-High
   School Version (LASSI-HS).
   Results-Comparison of students' Self-and Teacher-Assessment data showed
   that students in the Treatment Class were able to assess their own
   learning and progress as authentically as the teacher. Analyses of SPUR
   data revealed that the learning gains among the students in the
   Treatment Class were significantly greater than that of the Comparison
   class in tests requiring higher order thinking (p <= 0.05). Analyses of
   LASSI-HS showed that students in the Treatment Class made more
   statistically significant shifts towards demonstrating supportive
   learning behaviors and towards abandoning inhibiting behaviors than
   those in the Comparison Class (p <= 0.05).
   Conclusions-Thus, effective integration of PE in the instructional
   process helped students develop reflective thinking and other
   metacognitive skills and solve real-life problems that demand higher
   order thinking.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the current study is to develop a mathematics self-report
   inventory (MSRI) to measure Turkish elementary students' mathematics
   expectancy beliefs and task values based on the expectancy-value theory
   of achievement motivation. In Study-1 (n = 1,315), exploratory factor
   analysis (EFA) and reliability analysis are used to evaluate the MSRI.
   EFA results suggest a five-factor model that consists of interest value,
   extrinsic-utility value, importance value, personal cost, and expectancy
   beliefs. In Study-2 (n = 1,343), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and
   convergent, discriminant, and subgroup validity results are also used to
   examine construct validity for the MSRI. The results indicate that (a)
   elementary students' scores on the MSRI did not significantly differ by
   gender; (b) elementary students' scores on the MSRI were significantly
   influenced by grade level; and (c) a significant, positive, and strong
   relationship existed between students' scores on the MSRI and students'
   achievement scores from the Level Determination Exam. The findings of
   this study showed that, with a few exceptions, the MSRI is a reliable
   and valid psychological tool for use with the elementary students in
   Turkey and may be regarded as beneficial in guiding subsequent study
   goals by explaining students' achievement-related beliefs grounded in
   the expectancy value theory.},

Abstract = {The article gives an account of an experiment in which sixty-eight high
   school students of age 16 - 19 developed spreadsheet applications that
   simulated fall and projectile motion in the air. The students applied
   the Euler method to solve the governing differential equations. The aim
   was to promote STEM to the students and motivate them to study STEM at
   universities. A questionnaire survey was carried out to find out if the
   participants found the lessons interesting and if developing and using
   the spreadsheet models benefited the learning and contributed to the
   mathematical and technological knowledge of the students.},

Abstract = {In 2015, PISA and TIMSS are coming up to us together. In this study, the
   data from PISA and TIMSS are used to investigate that which one is a
   better indicator of national science and technology (S\&T)
   competitiveness? Number of S \& T journal articles (per million people)
   is used as a measure to represent the national S\&T competitiveness.
   Average IQ of the population, research and development (R\&D)
   expenditure (\% of GDP) and number of R\&D researchers and technicians
   which affect the national competitiveness in S\&T were also
   investigated. The study shows that PISA science scores would more
   significantly indicate national S\&T competitiveness than TIMSS.
   Moreover, the study also shows a strong link between competence in S\&T
   and IQ, research and development expenditure (\% of GDP) or number of
   research and development researchers and technicians. Some possible
   micro-foundations of these relationships are discussed, and policy
   implication is clear.},

Abstract = {In 2013 China announced the ``One Belt and One Road{''} policy,
   including the ``Silk Road Economic Belt{''} and the ``21st Century
   Maritime Silk Road.{''} The purpose of the two plans aims to establish a
   new connection of trade transportation between China, Central Asia and
   Europe, ``this is by far the most massive regional infrastructure plans
   we have seen.{''} In 2015 China again proposed the ``Made in China
   2025{''} plan, which identifies ``smart manufacturing{''} and applies
   technology innovation as the core development of equipment
   manufacturing, and thereby implementing major projects such as the
   national manufacturing innovation center. Nonetheless the predicament of
   industrial OEM model and the invasion from the rise of the red supply
   chain in China have led to considerably urgent demand for transition of
   manufacturing industry. The study objects comprise of manufacturers in
   transition to manufacturing servitization under the strong advocacy by
   Taiwan and applies TAM model to verify the user intention and
   suggestions for manufacturers in such innovative product development
   model. This conclusion is in accord with previous studies on new product
   development thinking model, which suggests that when users perceive ease
   of use and ease of learning, the innovative product development model
   will be considered to help performance improvement. The model allows
   first-line and entry-level employees to comprehend and understand they
   key execution, which is the best solution for perceived usefulness in
   supporting attitudes toward use and reducing risk concern factors.},

Abstract = {Early intervention and early education have a special place in educating
   the children with Impaired Hearing (IH). The advancements in information
   and communication technologies have led to adopting the view that such
   technologies could be applied in the educational process of the children
   with IH. Besides, the positive results acquired in the studies conducted
   in the light of this review have brought up the fact that proper
   technology-based educational environments should be provided and
   popularized for the young children with IH. In this study, educational
   software has been developed for the purpose of teaching emotions and
   opposite concepts to young children with IH. With this software, videos
   with topic descriptions, games reinforcing funny and topic-based
   learning, questions and audio-visual feedbacks have been used. The
   effectiveness of this software in concept education along with its
   usability by children has been examined; and in addition, the subjective
   viewpoints of the teachers of students with IH on this software have
   been consulted as well.},

Abstract = {International trended assessments have long attempted to provide
   instructional information to educational researchers and classroom
   teachers. Studies have shown that traditional methods of item analysis
   have not provided specific information that can be directly applicable
   to improve student performance. To this end, cognitive diagnosis models
   (CDMs) were developed to identify the presence or the absence of
   multiple fine-grained skills or attributes. This study reanalyzed the
   TIMSS 2003 8th grade mathematics assessment by applying a cognitive
   diagnosis modeling approach to provide useful information about test
   takers. Specifically, the deterministic, inputs, noisy, ``and{''} gate
   (DINA; Junker \& Sijtsma, 2001) model was used to provide more valuable
   diagnostic information about how well students perform on underlying
   skills and cognitive processes necessary to answer mathematics problems.
   Results showed that the interpretable benefits of using the DINA
   discrimination index provided additional information about comparative
   differences between the U.S. and Korea.},

Abstract = {In our study, we aimed to compare the impact of simulations, sequences
   of printed simulation frames and conventional static diagrams on the
   understanding of students with regard to the one-dimensional kinematics.
   Our student sample consisted of three classes of middle years students
   (N=63; mostly 15 year-olds). These three classes served as comparison
   groups in our pre-post quasi-experiment, whereby each of them was
   assigned to one of the experimental treatments, i.e. media types. The
   results of the ANCOVA showed that students who learned from simulations
   or from printed sequences of simulation frames significantly
   outperformed their peers who had learned one-dimensional kinematics from
   conventional static diagrams. Thereby, we have found that learning from
   sequences of simulation frames seems to be particularly effective for
   girls. The use of simulations or printed simulation frames has also
   proved to be associated with more positive attitudes of students towards
   kinematics instruction.},

Abstract = {In the past three decades, previous researches showed that students had
   various misconceptions of Newton's Third Law. The present study focused
   on students' difficulties in identifying the third-law force pair in
   gravity interaction situations. An instrument involving contexts with
   gravity and non-gravity associated interactions was designed and
   conducted among students in junior secondary school, senior high school
   and university. The finding revealed that students in all grades did
   statistically worse in gravity interaction contexts and had general
   difficulties in distinguishing interaction forces and balanced forces.
   However, students improved their reasoning on third-law force pair with
   the increase of grade level irrespective of contexts. Special
   difficulties for junior secondary school students in understanding
   gravity interaction were also addressed. It is important to emphasize
   that the educational contexts of gravity interactions should be paid
   more attention to.},

Abstract = {Even though dynamic geometry software (DGS) is becoming an emergent
   instructional tool for mathematics teachers, many teachers are still in
   the process of consideration about whether to use it. In order to
   encourage teachers to use DGS, this study seeks to discover mathematics
   teachers' salient beliefs about the use of DGS in mathematics class. The
   theory of planned behaviour serves as the theoretical framework for
   understanding teachers' intentions to use DGS. Thirty mathematics
   teachers who have knowledge of and experience using DGS were invited to
   fill out an online survey. Content analysis of teachers' responses was
   analysed using the theory of planned behaviour. The behavioural,
   normative and control beliefs of mathematics teachers using DGS in class
   were identified. These noticeable beliefs of teachers may be used to
   create conditions for teachers to successfully integrate this new tool
   in mathematics class.},

Abstract = {Whether teachers' conceptions of NOS are reflected in their
   instructional planning and classroom practice remains an important
   research question. Consequently, this study investigated teachers' NOS
   views and their relationship to their classroom practice and delineated
   the factors that facilitate or impede this relationship. To achieve
   this, seven high school biology teachers with teaching credentials were
   selected to participate in this study. These teachers filled out an
   open-ended questionnaire entitled Views of the Nature of Science
   Questionnaire, participated in semi-structured interviews, were
   videotaped, and their lesson plans were collected. Results showed that
   most teachers do not possess appropriate NOS views, lesson plans lacked
   any planning for teaching NOS, and teachers' practices lacked any
   explicit reference to the aspects of NOS.},

Abstract = {Investigating predictors of environmental attitudes may bring valuable
   benefits in terms of improving public awareness about biodiversity
   degradation and increased pro-environmental behaviour. Here we used an
   evolutionary approach to study environmental attitudes based on
   disease-threat model. We hypothesized that people vulnerable to diseases
   may ultimately protect themselves by increasing pro-environmental
   efforts. Indeed, school children who perceived themselves to be
   vulnerable to diseases had better pro-environmental attitudes than their
   less disease vulnerable counterparts. Disease sensitive children showed
   greater beliefs to myths about owls and cuckoos, but myths did not
   correlate with environmental attitudes. Children from rural areas and
   girls showed greater environmental concerns than males and children from
   cities. Only scientistic attitudes toward owls showed correlations with
   environmental attitudes which suggests that attitudes toward animals
   show no strong associations with environmental concerns as was
   implicitly suggested in previous studies. Overall, our study showed that
   an evolutionary approach can be applied to investigate the nature of
   inter-personal differences in environmental attitudes in humans.},

Abstract = {This paper used a Virtual Companion System (VCS) to examine how specific
   design variables within virtual learning companion affect the learning
   process of learners as defined by the cognitive continuum of
   field-dependent, field-independent and field-mixed learners in LINE app
   for m-learning. The data were collected from 198 participants in a
   training project that used virtual learning companion as an adjunct to
   classroom instruction. The study considered to what extent the three
   guidance methods offered by the VCS would affect the learning outcomes
   of participants with three different types of cognitive styles. Each of
   the three guidance methods available within the VCS was designed to
   conform to the specific needs of field-independent, field-dependent, or
   field-mixed participants. The results showed that participants who
   received a ``guidance method{''} matching their ``cognitive style{''}
   presented a significant improvement in their learning performance.},

Abstract = {This study attempted to explore 15 Korean elementary pre-service
   teachers' views of inquiry teaching. During a science teaching methods
   course, pre-service teachers implemented a peer teaching lesson, had a
   group discussion to reflect on five teacher educators' comments on their
   first peer teaching practice, and revised and re-taught the lesson as a
   second peer teaching practice. The results indicate that pre-service
   teachers changed their views of inquiry teaching from following the
   process of inquiry or a completely unstructured discovery approach to
   facilitating students' inquiry learning with instructional guidance. The
   importance of reflective group discussion and re-teaching a lesson is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Applicability of the issue under study is conditioned by the need in
   development of principal educational programs by higher education
   institutions with accounting for requirements of appropriate
   occupational standards and necessity in reviewing of the requirements of
   occupational standards and reflecting them within the scope of
   competences formed. The paper is aimed at substantiation of the subject
   matter of profile training disciplines for vocational education of
   bachelors within the context of competence and process approaches and
   with accounting for occupational standards. The leading method of study
   of this issue is modeling which allows considering the issue under study
   as a process of recognized accounting of requirements of appropriate
   occupational standards wherein employers' opinions are fixed in the
   regulatory mode. The structural-functional model of selection of the
   subject matter of profile disciplines for the training program is
   developed; the following algorithms are developed: 1) of analysis of
   occupational standards; 2) of comparing of occupational standards with
   curriculum disciplines; 3) of analysis of the subject matter of labour
   functions, labour actions, knowledge and skills when developing working
   programs and assessment resources funds; the model has been successfully
   tested on the example of profile training of vocational education
   bachelors. The paper presents the structure-functional model of
   selection of the subject matter of profile disciplines of the
   educational program with taking into account of occupational standards
   requirements which define competences acquired by a graduate, i.e.
   his/her ability to use knowledge, skills and personal qualities in
   accordance with the occupational activity; the process approach to
   implementation of this model is applied.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to specify the essence and the specifics of
   implementation of the pedagogic technology of forming the basics of
   future mathematics teachers' professionalism using the potential of
   multimedia in higher education. The major research method is pedagogical
   experiment (comprising analytical search, ascertaining, forming, and
   control stages) aimed at verifying the efficiency of the pedagogical
   technology of forming the basics of future mathematics teachers'
   professionalism; statistic methods have also been employed for checking
   efficiency and reliability of the experimental research results. The
   participants of the pedagogical experiment have been 290 students (150
   students of the experimental group and 140 students of the control
   group) of the training area 44.03.01 ``Pedagogical education{''}, skills
   profile ``Mathematics{''}. Theoretical issues on the nature, structure,
   criteria, indicators and levels of formation of the basics of future
   mathematics teachers' professionalism have been disclosed; the
   notion-category apparatus of the theory of the teacher professionalism
   has been specified; there has been scientifically grounded and developed
   the pedagogical technology of forming the basics of future mathematics
   teachers' professionalism that corresponds to the structure of the
   holistic pedagogical process and includes: target orientations,
   conceptual bases and regulations, procedural characteristics,
   program-methodological support, and an appropriate combination of
   traditional and multimedia tools. The results of the gradual
   introduction of the pedagogical technology of forming the basics of
   future mathematics teachers' professionalism by means of multimedia
   technologies indicate significant positive shifts in the formation of
   all the components of the basics of students' professionalism, which was
   reflected in the positive dynamics of the criteria for all indicators
   and generally indicates the effectiveness of the proposed pedagogical
   technology. Research materials can be used to further improve the theory
   and practice of the professional training, in particular, in the
   training of future mathematics teachers in the process of qualification
   improvement and personnel retraining, and in the self-educational
   activity of teachers.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to reveal the opinions of voters regarding the
   social environment and new media tools with respect to their educational
   status. In the survey, it was aimed to reveal the factors that
   constitute the elements of the social environment and new media tools by
   taking into account the educational situation of voters, which are
   preliminary. For this purpose, a questionnaire was applied to 440
   persons and interviewed in 5 provinces of the Northern part of Cyprus,
   which were determined by non-probability sampling method. When the
   research findings were evaluated, it was determined that the graduates
   of secondary schools are the mostly affected group by social environment
   during the campaigns. In addition, it was determined that `new media
   tools mostly affected graduate/doctoral graduates while voting decision

Abstract = {Mathematical representations are an essential tool in the study of
   mathematics and problem solving. They are also used in word problems to
   facilitate the transformation from textual to symbolic information. We
   proposed a stepwise, blocked, structured state transition graph (STG)
   based on the principles of instructional message design. In this study,
   we adopted a posttest-only non-equivalent group design to compare the
   performance of students who used either STG or matrix-like tables to
   learn to solve word problems via transition matrices. We also took into
   account the student's previous learning achievements in mathematics. The
   participants included four classes of senior students in a vocational
   high school, with two classes randomly designated as the experiment
   (STG) group and two designated as the control (Table) group.
   High-achieving students taught using STG outperformed their counterparts
   who were taught using matrix-like tables. The performance of
   low-achieving students appeared to be unaffected by the instructional
   method. These findings suggest that STG provides a clear representation
   of the relationships used in matrix calculation, which makes it easier
   to select and organize information. Nonetheless, alternative methods
   will be required to improve the performance of low-achieving students.},

   into everyone's life, and the positioning of data collection is an
   important goal of data analysis. However, the current applications
   mainly focus on outdoor device such as WIFI positioning technology was
   discussed the most often and also got a lot of well research results.
   This paper mainly discusses the application of Beacon technology in the
   information service of the library, and understands the user for the
   acceptance of new technology. Beacon technology is a combination of user
   and space environment of intelligent technology, beacon is a low-power
   Bluetooth sensor technology, the library can use this equipment to
   understand the use of library physical space and collections. The
   library can be combined with a smart mobile device via Beacon
   technology, allows users to receive the latest library information,
   users can also search on the smart mobile devices on various
   collections. Users can also direct the user to the bookshelf where the
   destination book is located, depending on the search needs entered by
   the user. This study discusses the user's intention to use Beacon in
   combination with the technology acceptance model and the innovation
   diffusion theory.},

Abstract = {Infographics have been frequently used in recent years with the purpose
   of the visual presentation of information. It is a visualisation method
   which aims at presenting any content with a visual composition,
   combining such elements as shapes, symbols, graphics, photographs,
   illustrations, and texts for the target audience. The purpose of this
   research is to develop an instructional design based on the ADDIE
   (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) model of
   infographic design as well as the determination of student and teacher
   opinions on the usage of infographics in teaching. The study group of
   the research consists of 43 teachers and 51 elementary school students
   from elementary schools in Cyprus who participated in the research
   process voluntarily. The implementation process of the study consisted
   of 52 hours of education in face-to-face and online learning
   environments with the participation of 43 elementary school teachers.
   The purpose of this education activity was to develop knowledge and
   skills in the theoretical and applied dimensions required for the design
   of infographics. The data collection tools used in the research were the
   ``self-efficacy scale for the design and usage of infographics{''}, the
   ``opinion survey for the usage of infographics in teaching
   environments{''}, a ``semi-structured interview form for the design of
   infographics for teachers and their usage in teaching environments{''}
   and a ``semi-structured interview form for elementary school students
   for the usage of infographics in education{''}. According to the results
   of the study, the opinions of elementary school teachers on the usage of
   infographics and their self-efficacy for infographic design shows a
   significant and positive difference before and after training.
   Interviews were held on the usage of infographics in learning
   environments with the 43 elementary school teachers and 51 elementary
   school students after the completion of the training process. Teachers
   used the infographics that they had developed according to the course
   contents for eight weeks in their courses after the training was
   completed and observed the impact of infographics in terms of different
   dimensions. At the end of the implementation, it was found that both
   teachers and students had positive opinions on the usage of infographics
   in learning environments.},

Abstract = {Objective: The rise of ``MOOC{''}, a newly online learning mode, has
   many Chinese courses moved forward teaching mode based on ``MOOC{''}. It
   refers to mode that learners could learn their essential course via
   internet and better communicate and interact with classmates online. So
   it is very necessary to go deeper into study the mode to give its
   teaching method into better play. Methods: In this paper, efforts have
   been made to consult lots of documents so as to design the application
   of ``MOOC{''} into sports course teaching. Results: Research has shown
   that ``MOOC{''} enable students to learn profession-al sports
   theoretical knowledge and skills and movements in traditional class, but
   also obtain same achievement through online learning. The teaching mode
   breaks through previous teaching method as teachers-centered and
   students passively accepting knowledge, which could promote students'
   ability to learn knowledge proactively, stimulate them to learn
   independently, ``get out of{''} independence on teacher on books, and
   enhance their ability of exchanging and interacting with classmates. For
   teachers, under the circumstance of ``MOOC{''}, they have to face with
   heavier amount of sports course teaching work, they should timely
   investigate students learning progress, share the experience online and
   address problems students may occur to as well as mobilize online course
   timely in accordance with students' concrete conditions before, during
   and after class.},

Title = {Forecasting Patient Visits to Hospitals using a WD\&ANN-based

Abstract = {Forecasting the number of patient visits to hospitals has aroused an
   increasingly large interest from both theoretic and application
   perspectives. To enhance the accuracy of forecasting hospital visits,
   this paper proposes a hybrid approach by coupling wavelet decomposition
   (WD) and artificial neural network (ANN) under the framework of
   ``decomposition and ensemble{''}. In this model, the WD is first
   employed to decompose the original monthly data of the number of patient
   visits to hospitals into several components and one residual term. Then,
   the ANN as a powerful prediction tool is implemented to fit each
   decomposed component and generate individual prediction results.
   Finally, all individual prediction values are fused into the final
   prediction output by simple addition method. For illustration and
   verification, four sets of monthly series data of the number of patient
   visits to hospitals are used as the sample data, and the results show
   that the proposed model can obtain significantly more accurate
   forecasting results than all considered popular forecasting techniques.},

Abstract = {This study examined the concerns of faculty members regarding the
   adoption of a Learning Management System (LMS) employing the
   Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM). Forty-seven faculty members from a
   university in Jordan completed the Stages of Concern Questionnaire
   (SoCQ). The SoCQ was used to assess the strength of faculty members'
   concerns in seven areas: awareness, information, personal impact,
   management, consequences, collaboration and refocusing. The results
   showed that the respondents' concerns were greatest in the early stages
   of the introduction of the LMS. Faculty members had a general lack of
   awareness about LMS and did not have enough information about it. The
   faculty members had little interest in or engagement with the LMS; they
   wanted to know more about the effect of LMS on them personally.
   Furthermore, faculty members had concerns about the management, time,
   and logistical aspects of the implementation of LMS.},

Abstract = {The topicality of the research is stipulated by the challenges the legal
   education faces due to the controversial trends toward globalization and
   national legal system preservation, toward comprehensive legal training
   on the one hand, and the market increasing demand for narrow-field
   practitioners. The aims of the research are to study law students'
   perceptions regarding teaching/learning formats of studies in progress,
   to follow the development of students' perceptions regarding their legal
   studies at different levels of higher education. The research methods
   included theoretical analysis, law students' survey, statistics data
   processing. The empirical studies included two surveys: the entry survey
   of second year students of LLB and the same students' survey when they
   have moved to the second year of their master studies. The research
   enhances the awareness of the specific characteristics of public
   international law teaching within national system of legal culture and
   its values. The empirical data contributes to teachers' understanding of
   students' needs and raises awareness of learner-centered education
   within legal domain. The article had both theoretical and practical
   value as the theoretical background and the proposed methodology can be
   applied to developing training courses for legal faculty.},

Abstract = {Didactical strategies are one of the most influential vehicles that
   directly contribute to transforming knowledge. Varying types of
   didactical approaches are being adopted and implemented in the
   preparation of future teachers in the initial teacher education set up.
   The current conceptual paper is based on rigorous literature review on
   the typologies of didactical strategies adopted in the initial teacher
   education. The purpose of this conceptual and theoretical study is to
   evaluate and contrast varying didactical approaches while navigating
   through literature. The study also aims at exploring the
   interrelationship of didactical approaches with teacher cognitions i.e.,
   teacher pedagogical beliefs. The methodology of this study based on the
   selection of six types of didactical strategies by Van De Grift (2007)
   and to compare and contrast them with other typologies available in
   literature and to explore the interrelationship with teachers'
   pedagogical beliefs. The study concludes that the varying typologies of
   didactical strategies are being adopted and implemented in the ITE set
   up and these strategies have strong relationship with teacher's
   pedagogical beliefs. The study recommends that the teachers' cognitions
   i.e., teachers' pedagogical beliefs may be included in the curriculum
   when preparing future teachers in the initial teacher education setting.
   These findings are substantial for policy makers, curriculum developers,
   head teachers, and other stakeholders in the initial teacher education.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the primary school teachers'
   attitudes toward teacher evaluation for professional development (TEPD)
   and teaching effectiveness in remote districts. The questionnaire survey
   method was adopted in this study, formal questionnaires were distributed
   to 500 elementary school teachers in Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas by
   stratified random sampling, 446 questionnaires were returned, 393 were
   answered completely, the valid return rate was 88.12\%. The findings
   were as follows: (1) The attitudes toward teacher evaluation for
   professional development among primary school teachers in remote
   districts was above average, with the most positive attitudes toward
   ``evaluation outcome application{''}. (2) Teachers in remote districts
   in Kaohsiung and Pingtung had a favorable perception in teaching
   effectiveness, with the most favorable perception in ``teaching
   assessment and classroom management{''}. (3) There are differences among
   primary school teachers' attitudes toward teacher evaluation for
   professional development in seniority, experience of participating in
   TEPD and school districts. (4) The primary school teachers' attitudes on
   teaching effectiveness have middle to high performance. However, no
   difference was observed on teachers' various backgrounds of gender, age,
   highest academic degree, post, seniority, experience of participating in
   TEPD, and school location in remote districts. (5) The primary school
   teachers' attitudes toward teacher evaluation for professional
   development show low positive correlation with their teaching
   effectiveness at various dimensions.},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, many researchers have tested course designs
   that may better engage students in developing countries, accommodate for
   Millennials' desires to learn and teach at will, and teach students the
   skills they need for their first jobs. The vision of this paper for a
   web design course seeks to address these issues for engineering
   students. The paper first details the ` study everywhere, anytime, from
   any device and using any tool' approach, following the CDIO (Conceive,
   Design, Implement and Operate) contextual learning model sustained by
   gamified crowdsourcing. Then the multi-pronged approach has been tested
   in a high-enrollment (269-student) web design course at a university in
   China. The success of integrating the gamification and crowdsourcing
   techniques into the web design course is then analyzed. Results are
   positive overall. A linear upward trend is observed in the number of
   students who completed the course exercises over the duration of the
   course, marking an increase in student engagement over time.},

Abstract = {The Mechanical Waves Conceptual Survey (MWCS), presented in 2009, is the
   most important test to date that has been designed to evaluate
   university students' understanding of four main topics: propagation,
   superposition, reflection, and standing waves. In a literature review,
   we detected a significant need for a study that uses this test as an
   assessment tool and presents a complete analysis of students'
   difficulties on the test. This article addresses this need. We
   administered the MWCS at a private university in Mexico to 541 students.
   In this article, we present a complete description of these students'
   performance on the test, a description of their main difficulties, an
   elaboration of these main difficulties in terms of students'
   inappropriate conceptions, and recommendations for instruction based on
   the results obtained by the test. Our analyses may be used by
   instructors and researchers who intend to use the MWCS or create new
   instructional material.},

Abstract = {This study explores the attitudes of mathematics pre-service teachers,
   based on their initial exposure to a model-eliciting challenge. The new
   Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement determines that mathematics
   students should be able to identify, investigate and solve problems via
   modelling. The unpreparedness of mathematics teachers in teaching
   modelling is widely recognized. Modelling was thus included for the
   first time in the mathematics education curriculum of a South African
   university. Based on their modelling exposure, the participants revealed
   their attitudes via an Attitudes towards Mathematics Modelling
   Inventory. The Mann Whitney U-test detected significant differences
   between gender and achievement groups. Most participants displayed
   positive attitudes towards modelling, even after this brief exposure.
   The main implications of the study are that the modelling competencies
   of mathematics pre-service-teachers could be strengthened during their
   formal education by lecturers that adopt an appropriate modelling
   pedagogy that takes cognizance of their attitudes, while gradually
   building their confidence},

Abstract = {This study examines the international risks faced by multinational
   enterprises to understand their impact on the evaluation of investment
   projects. Moreover, it establishes a `three-dimensional' theoretical
   framework of risk identification to analyse the composition of
   international risk indicators of multinational enterprises based on the
   theory of an enterprise's international development path and stages as
   well as risk management. Using entropy weights and net present value
   (NPV), this study employs survey data to empirically analyse the
   international risk entropy evaluation model and then test the NPV
   evaluation model based on risk adjustment. A significant difference is
   found between the evaluation process of multinationals' international
   investment benefits with and without considering the risk factors. This
   study concludes that the results of the risk-adjusted NPV model are more
   scientific and effective than that of the traditional NPV model as the
   basis of decision-making. It contributes to the theoretical literature
   by proposing the international risk entropy model and constructing the
   risk-adjusted NPV model to test the impact of international risk factors
   on the evaluation of international investment projects. This provides a
   reference to multinationals in their choice of investment projects as
   well as to researchers in this field.},

Abstract = {Evolution Teaching (ET) among in-service teachers in Greece was examined
   in an attempt to evaluate their Pedagogical Content Knowledge. Evolution
   teaching is a problematic issue. For this purpose, we constructed a
   questionnaire that was distributed to the target population and to which
   181 teachers responded. We used quantitative method to determine factors
   that may characterize the ET milieu and which of the factors of PCK
   apply or not to ET. Our research finds that Biology teachers although
   strive to teach evolution, face specific difficulties due to lack of
   PCK. The research results may be useful when organizing and implementing
   professional development programs of teachers on ET.},

Abstract = {In response to the global trend of low carbon and the concept of
   sustainable development, enterprises need to develop R\&D for the
   manufacturing of energy-saving and sustainable products and low carbon
   products. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to construct a
   decision model for sustainable product design and development from
   product servicizing in Taiwan. The study used the grounded theory to
   extract the results of the expert interviews to analyze factors of
   sustainable product design and development under principles of product
   servicizing. Then, this study established a sustainable development
   checklist of product servicizing based on life cycle as the criterion of
   evaluation for sustainable product design and development. Finally, the
   study constructed a decision model for sustainable development of
   product design and servicizing.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore the factors in a patient's rehabilitation
   achievement after a total knee replacement (TKR) patient exercises,
   using a PCA-ANFIS emotion model-based game rehabilitation system, which
   combines virtual reality (VR) and motion capture technology. The
   researchers combine a principal component analysis (PCA) and an adaptive
   network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to present a predicting,
   artificial emotion model with a Plutchik emotional wheel in a 3D Gesture
   gamification rehabilitation system, and illustrate the value of the
   Plutchik emotional wheel. Also, this study tries to improve a
   rehabilitant's self-efficacy, based on interesting games and the use of
   Kinect technology to capture a rehabilitant's motion. This
   quasi-experimental design required two months to collect the PRS
   rehabilitation treatment data from the study's participants, who were
   divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group,
   rehabilitated with a PRS, filled out a questionnaire and evaluated
   whether the system operations and self-efficacy changes affected their
   rehabilitation achievement. These findings could be referenced for
   related researchers designing auxiliary tools and for helping physical
   therapists improve rehabilitants' performance. Meanwhile, these findings
   recommend that patients have the operation in the early stages and that
   they form regular exercise habits for a better rehabilitation outcome.},

Abstract = {Generally, in the foundation course of architectural design, much
   emphasis is placed on teaching of the basic design skills without
   focusing on teaching students to apply the basic design concepts in
   their architectural designs or promoting students' own creativity.
   Therefore, this study aims to propose a concept transformation learning
   model to achieve the learning objective via the input-process-output
   learning process, which focuses on: (1) the information transmission of
   the concept (or conceptual frame); (2) the students' simulation,
   analogy, analysis, and innovation; and (3) the works output (or learning
   output). In this study, three design assignments of 2D composition, 3D
   composition, and architecture form composition are given to the students
   to promote their motivation of active learning via the concept
   transformation learning model. The effectiveness of the concept
   transformation learning model is verified by comparing the results of
   the pre-test questionnaires and the post-test questionnaires. The
   questionnaire results also indicate that, with the concept
   transformation learning model, students' creativity can be effectively
   promoted so that they can become more interest and more active in their
   learning. The research results can be referred by further teaching and
   studies of architectural design.},

Abstract = {There is widespread agreement that science learning always builds upon
   students' existing ideas and that science teachers should possess
   knowledge of learners. This study aims at investigating pre-service
   science teachers' knowledge of student misconceptions and difficulties,
   a crucial component of PCK, on Newton's Third Law. A questionnaire was
   designed and conducted to 143 pre-service science teachers enrolled in a
   normal university in China. A comparison between participants'
   predictions and student actual outcomes was detected. The result
   revealed a tendency for pre-service science teachers to under-predict
   the problem-solving ability of senior high school students. Furthermore,
   most pre-service science teachers neglected two common learning
   difficulties in Newton's Third Law. It seems that there is a need to
   help pre-service science teachers be aware of their own
   misunderstandings about students.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to test whether anxiety toward mathematics
   is made up of a five-factor structure: anxiety toward evaluation,
   anxiety toward temporality, anxiety toward understanding of mathematical
   problems, anxiety toward numbers and operations, and anxiety toward
   mathematical situations in real life. Our study sample was formed of one
   thousand students from the Centro de Estudios Tecnologicos Industrial y
   de Servicios No. 15 in Veracruz City. The statistics technique used was
   structural equation modeling. The results of goodness of fit indices are
   meaningful when applied to students in High School Education, which
   indicates that the hypothetical model fits the theoretical model.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to identify the difficulties that information
   technology student teachers have in teaching concepts. This qualitative
   study was carried out with 12 student teachers. The student teachers
   were fourth-year students enrolled in the Special Teaching Methods II
   course in the spring semester of the 2010-2011 academic year. The
   research data were obtained from three types of data resources: lesson
   videos, lesson plans and reflection reports written by student teachers.
   The lesson videos, lesson plans and reflection reports were subjected to
   a descriptive analysis process. In the study, it was determined that
   some student teachers could not distinguish concept knowledge, had
   misconceptions and difficulty determining conceptual features and used
   incomplete or incorrect concept definitions. Moreover, the student
   teachers did not use examples and analogies effectively during teaching.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine pre-service and in-service
   science and mathematics teachers. perceptions of the characteristics of
   a professional teaching environment. The study further investigated the
   relationships of field placement contexts and grade levels on
   pre-service teachers. perceptions of importance and availability of
   certain aspects of a professional teaching environment. The teacher
   perceptions were assessed using the Professional Environment for
   Teaching Survey (PETS). The responses reflecting the teacher perceptions
   of importance were subjected to a principal component analysis and two
   components were identified. These were Resources for Teaching and
   Recognition of Teacher Contributions. Data obtained from pre-service
   teachers who (were) enrolled in a graduate teacher education licensure
   program at a large Midwestern university and from in-service teachers
   who were mentors for the pre-service teachers. Correlation and forward
   stepwise multiple regression analyses of the data suggested that the
   perceptions of importance and/or availability of those pre-service or
   in-service teachers with more experience were related to the academic
   degree they held and the content that they were teaching or expecting to
   teach. Results for the in-service and pre-service teachers. perceptions
   were discussed in terms of characteristics of a professional teaching

Abstract = {Algebra is often considered as difficult and mysterious doctrine due to
   numerous symbols that represent mathematical notions. Results of the
   research on students. interpretation of literal expressions show that
   only a small number of students are ready to accept that a letter can
   represent a variable. The aim of this research with students of the
   fourth grade of elementary school was to examine the impact of the use
   of various symbols, which represent the relationships between the
   quantities, on students. understanding of the meanings of literal
   expressions. We used experimental method (with one group) and the
   testing techniques (pre-test and final-test comparisons). The research
   results show that the iconic representation of the structure of literal
   expressions, namely, giving meaning to a term through its reliance on
   certain schemes in the learning process, significantly affects the
   ability of students in modelling generic quantitative relationships, and
   in the development of the meaning of letters in the role of algebraic
   variable.},

Abstract = {The lack of exposure to practical work in primary schools leads to
   incompetency in manipulative skills and students may carry this problem
   with them to secondary school. To address this issues, an in-depth
   qualitative study was conducted during transition from primary to
   secondary school. The research involved 10 primary school students
   (grade 6) who were interviewed again in secondary school (grade 7).
   Manipulative skills during transition can be described by understanding
   of technical skills and functional aspects of performing laboratory
   tasks. Findings indicated that students' cognitive knowledge did not
   reflect their true ability in manipulative skills. Further collaboration
   between primary and secondary schools should be considered in order to
   bridge the gap during transition.},

Abstract = {This article examines Finnish mathematics student teachers'
   epistemological beliefs concerning the nature of mathematics and the
   goals of mathematics teaching and learning solely in the beginning of
   their studies at university. A total of 18 students participated in a
   study consisting of a short questionnaire and interviews. The data was
   analyzed by categorizing the views presented in terms of four
   mathematics-related orientations. According to the results, student
   teachers often regarded mathematics mainly as a static system, but their
   beliefs about the goals of mathematics teaching and learning consisted
   of features that derive from all of the four orientations. Future
   teachers' beliefs can be affected by teacher education and hence the
   results are important for teacher educators to be recognized.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze in detail the process in which a
   5th grade student learned proportion and percent using double number
   lines and to obtain insights into how his use of those representations
   supported his learning. A series of lessons were designed and conducted
   in a class and the whole learning process of one student was
   video-recorded. The analysis showed that he used double number lines to
   search for various multiplicative relationships in problem situations
   and their consistent pictures, rather than to make necessary numerical
   expressions systematically. The analysis also showed that such uses of
   number lines made it possible for him to control his proportional
   reasoning and develop his understanding of proportion and percent.},

Abstract = {The spatial orientation skill allows us to determine our location in
   relation to the environment. It can be developed through specific
   training, and is a competence to be acquired in STEM university degrees
   related to geospatial information. In addition to map reading, an
   activity that provides the spatial orientation skill is wayfinding.
   While wayfinding the information obtained from successive views of the
   environment provides spatial orientation. This research presents an
   immersive orientation experiment, in which an urban environment is
   displayed through a Smartphone installed in VR 3D glasses. The motion
   direction is controlled with a joystick. In the experiment 32-second
   year engineering students from La Laguna University participated, and
   the average gain in spatial orientation skill was of 12.81 degrees,
   measured with the Perspective Taking Spatial Orientation Test. No gender
   differences detected. This gain is less than that obtained in previous
   experiments with GISc, Geoportals and Augmented Reality resources.},

Abstract = {Marriage is a social environment created by individuals with the purpose
   of sharing their lives and founding their family, and it is of great
   importance so that the individual can adapt to his environment and
   becomes a beneficial person to the society. For this reason, it is
   assumed that knowledge of love language of individuals, developing
   factors related to marriage harmony satisfaction and conducting new
   researches will increase the life satisfaction and happiness in
   marriage. In addition, it is believed that signification of lives of
   individuals and their reinforcement in emotional and material sense will
   create the basis of healthy families. The aim of this study is to adapt
   the Five Love Language Scale developed by Egbert and Polk (2006) to
   Turkish culture. The sample of this research consists of 459
   individuals, 257 of whom are females and 202 of whom are males. Scholars
   at Education Faculty were utilized in order to perform the validation
   and reliability study of the scale which was developed for English
   speaking couples to measure the love language of married individuals and
   after a preliminary test the scale was adapted to Turkish language.},

Abstract = {In this study, the ``4MAT (4 Mode Application Techniques) Teaching
   Model{''} and ``Interdisciplinary Concept Model{''}, the applications of
   which aimed to gather different disciplines around the selected
   concepts, were integrated within the scope of the disciplines of
   mathematics and social studies. For this study, these two models were
   combined to develop and test what was designated the I4MAT
   (Interdisciplinary 4MAT) model. The study was planned with a
   pretest-posttest, control group, experimental design. The study involved
   65 students (primary school, 2016). This study found that the attainment
   level of students and their mean scores significantly favored the
   experimental group. It also found that education with the I4MAT model
   effectively and fully attained the learning aims and achievement and
   that the scores differed in the control group according to their
   learning styles.},

Abstract = {When a science park or a technology park react to a transformation in
   the world, it becomes important to determine how to eliminate components
   with poor performance that have not contributed to the country's overall
   research and development targets. The theory and goal of competitiveness
   clusters and technology parks in France is similar. The territory of the
   Technology Park is a type of organization with a structure that can be
   re-organized, just as the concept of Fractal Theory, to become
   diversified into an organization through re-organization. This study
   uses the Fuzzy Delphi method to investigate France and Taiwan's
   innovation strategies by analysing the degree of recognition of park
   evaluation items in an expert questionnaire as a preliminary study of
   park evaluation in developing Science Parks in Taiwan.},

Abstract = {Universal environmental contamination is a real situation that
   deteriorates our world step by step. The dairy factory out flowing is
   the second greatest source of contamination in water streams. The
   environmental impact of these factories can be very high, especially due
   to the discharge of wastewater with high content of organic matter and
   nutrients. These problems can be analyzed only after performing factual
   study of various physicochemical characteristics. In the presented
   study, physicochemical parameters like, temperature, pH, COD, TDS, TS
   and SS were taken into account. Another purpose of this study is to
   ascertain university student's awareness and consciousness against
   general and dairy products related environments. These levels were
   evaluated by the survey method. The data obtained from the questionnaire
   were analyzed using SPSS 20.0. Results showed that the public and
   company owners/ employees in particular should be informed about the
   seasonal and cheese variety dependent patterns in environmental
   pollution.},

Abstract = {For the acquisition of spatial reasoning, content is learned more
   quickly by means of the use of 3D objects. In the field of surveying
   engineering education, research has been carried out to promote the
   ability to interpret relief using 3D terrain representations with
   positive results, in which the instructor provided these 3D-models to
   the student. In the present research a change is proposed in the
   teaching-learning strategy in which the student ceases to be a passive
   subject who is asked to exercise with a 3D-model to adopt a creative
   role, since the student creates the object of learning using 3D tools.
   Under this approach can be measured also the impact of this strategy on
   creative competence. Results of 2 workshops performed with 115
   engineering studies shows that this strategy help them to interpret the
   relief, and their creativity is improved in 36 points measured with the
   Abreaction Test of Creativity.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to review and investigate the evolutionary
   course of technological education together with engineering before and
   after the industrial revolution. A brief history of technology and
   engineering is provided in this study with regards to Daniel Bell's
   documents who believed that mankind has so far experienced three
   technological revolutions. The first one is the invention of heat pumps,
   the second a result of advancements in chemistry and electricity, and
   the third revolution, which occurred after world war 2, is when new
   information technology and communication and thought technology entered
   the era of post-industrialism. This period was divided into 5 segments
   including before the industrial revolution, the emergence of the
   industrial revolution until 1913, from 1913 to the launching of the
   Sputnik satellite, from 1950-1980, and from 1980 to now. Considering the
   developments taken place, it can be concluded that educational
   approaches for engineering have changed following the changes in
   technological education.},

Abstract = {W ith the continuous popularization of Internet, the influence of new
   media permeates all fields and levels of society. The arrival of the new
   media era has brought great influence to the traditional computer
   education. On the one hand, it provides opportunities for computer
   teachers to improve their teaching ability and knowledge level, and on
   the other hand, they bring a certain impact. For computer teachers, how
   to seize the opportunities brought about by the new media era, and meet
   the challenges, has become a new topic. All computer teachers should
   attach great importance to the impact of the new media era, raise the
   level of computer teaching, and maintains a certain self-control, moral
   awareness and legal awareness, so that the new media can be used
   rationally. This paper firstly analyzes the existing traditional
   computer education under the new media era of the problem, and then
   elaborates on the positive impact and negative effects of the new media
   era on the traditional computer education. In addition, the regression
   model and the factors of negative impact of new media on traditional
   computer education are analyzed. Finally, it points out that: on the one
   hand, the computer teacher should speed up the learning of new
   technologies, explore new teaching methods, change teaching ideas,
   master the concept and basic knowledge of new media, the use of new
   media, and the understanding of new media environment, as well as the
   ethics and safety awareness of new media. On the other hand, new media
   literacy should be introduced into the computer class. Teachers and
   students should strengthen the new media literacy, and let students
   actively participate in activities, to maintain and improve the
   knowledge of computer. Only in this way can we improve the quality of
   computer teaching, make better use of new media for computer learning,
   and make the traditional computer education glowing with new vitality.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of nurse candidates'
   digital storytelling boards and hand-drawn storytelling boards (the
   current method) on processes of empathising with patients and analysing
   the case. The study designed in mixed research model was conducted with
   the 1st year nursing students in Turkey. While the experimental group
   used web 2.0 tools to prepare their storytelling boards, the control
   group used paper and pencil to prepare their storytelling boards.
   Storytelling boards designed by the students were analysed under the
   titles of empathising with patients and analysing cases and opinions of
   the nurse candidates about the process were assessed. The experimental
   group analysed cases more easily and tried to see the incidences from
   the others' eyes more compared to the control group. Besides, this
   process was an interesting and enjoyable one. Digital storytelling would
   be an alternative and effective teaching method for nursing education.},

Abstract = {Test for mediating effect is an important method in social science
   research. In this paper, we applied mediating effect test in corporate
   acquisition research. Acquisition is one of the most important ways to
   expand a company, especially in emerging markets. From the perspective
   of institutional view, we made an empirical research on the relationship
   between geographic and institutional factors and the acquisition
   performance based on a sample of acquisitions in China. We found that
   acquisition legitimacy based on different region, including external and
   internal legitimacy, has positive effect on acquisition performance. We
   conclude that cross-region acquisition has negative influence on
   external legitimacy of acquisition, while having no significant
   influence on internal legitimacy of acquisition.},

Abstract = {ICT belongs to modern life and is playing a growing role in education.
   For effective implementation of ICT in the classroom, teachers need to
   develop both positive attitudes and self-efficacy towards using these
   tools in educational settings. However, information measuring how
   positive such attitudes towards and how developed teachers'
   self-efficacy on the use of ICT in education are remains scarce. This
   study examines the development of prospective chemistry teachers'
   ICT-related attitudes and their corresponding self-efficacy. It focuses
   on secondary level chemistry pre-service teachers' attitudes and
   self-efficacy concerning the use of ICT in education in general, and in
   chemistry teaching in particular. Data was collected from pre-service
   teachers (n = 239) at different stages of their teacher education
   programs. The study describes the progression of domain-specific
   self-efficacy. It also investigates gender differences and highlights
   the influence of seminars on the use of ICT in science education.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to examine the impact of knowledged staff's subjective
   person-career fit on the knowledged staff's career subjective
   well-being. Moreover, this study further investigated the subjective
   person-career fit could be influenced by the career self-management and
   perceived organizational support. However, the antecedents of knowledged
   staff's person-career fit seemed to have been under-investigated in the
   management literature. A questionnaire survey was used as a research
   instrument, and 221 full-time knowledged employees from China took part
   in the investigation. The hypotheses were tested by using partial least
   squares and structural equation modeling tool. The results confirmed
   that good subjective person-career fit would significantly increase the
   knowledged staff's career subjective well-being. Yet, the results also
   suggested that career self-management and perceived organizational
   support are the mechanisms that promoted this relation. This paper made
   a valuable contribution to career literatures discussions about the
   effect of career self-management and organizational support on the
   knowledged staff's subjective person-career fit. This paper also would
   be useful to the academic communities, the public and other interested
   parties who are interested in improving individual career subjective
   well-being during their periods of career.},

Abstract = {This study explores science teachers' views regarding Science,
   Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) pedagogy and its
   interdisciplinary nature. It also seeks to identify teachers' views on
   the contextual factors that facilitate and hinder such pedagogy in their
   schools. Qualitative methodologies were used through focus group
   discussions and an interview protocol. From the specific contextual
   issues that were highlighted in the findings, was teacher self-efficacy,
   pedagogical-knowledge, issues related to establishing a collaborative
   school culture and familiarity to STEM education among school
   administrators, students and parents. Findings expressed teachers'
   concerns of their under-preparedness to enact STEM practices and
   illustrated that engineering is the least mentioned discipline to be
   integrated with science. The study ends with recommendations that could
   lead to develop a professional development model to enact STEM education
   in schools based on valuing partnership with universities and industries
   as a necessary step for enacting a STEM integrated model.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the present study is due to the importance of
   developing creativity which can be achieved through a variety of school
   subjects including mathematics. In the article the potential of extended
   (supplementary) mathematical education (in primary and secondary
   schools) is highlighted. The main objective of this study is to examine
   and evaluate the contents, practices and methods that are currently
   employed in extended education. The main empirical method of this study
   is modeling of the modular system of lessons (the course) that offers a
   variety of assignments including non-standard tasks, puzzles and
   problems; tasks and topics from academic Olympiads and other
   mathematical competitions; creative tasks, practical assignments and
   experiments with mathematical materials ({''}empirical{''} mathematics);
   team and individual competitions and organization of home readings on a
   specific subject. The article describes the author's methodology. The
   main feature of the developed course is the inclusion of various
   organizational forms and diverse materials aimed at sustaining
   schoolchildren's interest towards mathematics, enabling them to deal
   with advanced level mathematical problems and developing their curiosity
   and creativity. The course ``Developmental Mathematics{''} that is
   presented in this article has been empirically tested since 2008.},

Abstract = {This study mainly aimed to explore the effects of project-based learning
   (PBL) integrated into science, technology, engineering and mathematics
   (STEM) activities and to analyze the creativity displayed by junior high
   school students while performing these activities. With a
   quasi-experimental design, 60 ninth-grade students from a junior high
   school in southern Taiwan were selected as subjects to participate in
   the six-week teaching experiment. The teaching design was centered on
   STEM activities and integrated with the strategy of project-based
   learning. The teaching contents included teaching materials integrating
   CaC2 steamship-derived knowledge of science, technology, engineering,
   mathematics, physics and chemistry as well as related teaching
   activities. Three conclusions were drawn. First, the key teaching points
   of the five stages of STEM project-based learning-preparation,
   implementation, presentation, evaluation and correction-can improve
   students' creativity. The learning objectives of STEM project-based
   learning can strengthen students' ability in STEM learning and
   STEM-integrated application. STEM project-based learning can further
   develop the affective domain of creativity, including adventurousness,
   curiosity, imagination and challenge. Based on the conclusions, this
   paper proposes suggestions regarding the implementation of STEM PBL
   activities to enhance the creativity and STEM-integrated application
   ability of junior high school students.},

Abstract = {Most students thinking mathematics is a difficult subject. This study
   aims to enhance students' motivation and efficiency in learning
   mathematics. This study developed 3D animation on the binomial theorem
   with historical stories of mathematics as the plot. It also examined the
   effect of animation on students' learning willingness and comprehension.
   And using questionnaire to collect data. The results showed that enhance
   the students' comprehension of the binomial theorem, suggesting that 3D
   animation could effectively improve mathematical learning. Moreover, the
   results showed that the students' willingness to learn mathematics also
   increased, suggesting that 3D animation can be used as an auxiliary
   learning tool for students. The results demonstrated that using 3D
   animation can improve students' learning willingness, comprehension, and
   application of mathematics.},

Abstract = {Adoption of Electronic Learning (eLearning) for the dissemination of
   higher education is rapidly increasing day by day. A large number of
   universities offering hundreds of course and a large number of the
   students are taking advantage from this type of learning paradigm. The
   purpose of this study is to investigate the delay factor in answering
   the students' questions. The tutoring of the students will be very
   effective if the student's queries are responded well in time. The
   student questions are replied by the instructors using online Learning
   Management Systems (LMS). These queries are often delayed too long that
   students have to wait, and their learning is also disturbed. The
   participants are selected by random sampling method. Total queries are
   3434, which are analyzed, and delay is calculated by using a proposed
   algorithm. The clusters of the student's questions and patterns are
   recognized. The automated correction of the student questions by the
   help of the vocabulary or dictionary APIs. The Application Programmable
   Interface (APIs) will speed up the question answering of the student
   queries. The gap in the science educational literature, the
   constructivist in the eLearning environment, students' motivation,
   self-efficacy and anxiety in science subject assessment effect the
   learning curve of the students negatively or positively.},

Abstract = {Teachers' beliefs, together with sound technological pedagogical content
   knowledge (TPACK), are directly related to the effective integration of
   technology in mathematics teaching. This study explored the relationship
   between pre-service teachers' behavioural intention to use technology to
   teach mathematics and their TPACK. A case-study analysis was conducted
   to determine whether six pre-service teachers' behavioural intention to
   use technology in their classroom delivery was associated with a
   predominance of TPACK (the TPACK model component) in their choice of
   technology-supported mathematical tasks. The findings showed a
   considerable disconnect between pre-service teachers' behavioural
   intention and their technological pedagogical content knowledge. Even
   where they expressed favourable intentions, the type of knowledge they
   called into play when selecting technology-supported tasks was unrelated
   to TPACK and did not suffice to identify the educational potential of
   technology. An emphasis on TPACK, in conjunction with the development of
   favourable attitudes toward the use of technology, is therefore believed
   to be indispensable in pre-service teacher education programmes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a conceptual framework for
   diagnosing teaching difficulties of a science topic in the science
   classroom. The development of the framework is presented as well as
   descriptions of the features of the framework. How the framework can be
   used is also elaborated? Furthermore, there is a detailed indication of
   an example in which the framework was used. It is also recommended that
   further studies can be done on the intersection between teacher
   knowledge and the kinds of discourse it promotes. That is the focus can
   be on the connection between teacher content knowledge and the classroom
   discourse. Hence, the researcher can use the framework to analyse the
   intersection of those from the perspective of teacher action.},

Abstract = {The results of the National Assessment of Educational Achievement from
   2010 to 2013 have shown a downward trend in ninth graders' science
   average achievement scores from 2011 to 2013. The percentage of students
   in the Advanced level decreased dramatically from 19.95\% in 2010 to
   11.48\% in 2013, while the percentage of students in the Basic level
   showed an increase. By analyzing several statistics such as the
   percentage of correct answers, item discrimination, and average response
   rate by achievement level, we were able to identify possible
   discrepancies between students' academic abilities and their respective
   curriculums. In addition, the characteristics of each level of student
   achievement were defined so that we could help students, teachers, and
   schools by providing them with basic information. We also included
   discussions on how to fine tune the achievement standards of the science
   curriculum as well as how to implement improved and customized teaching
   and learning methods.},

Abstract = {This descriptive study aims to investigate the instructional
   effectiveness of Open Educational Resources (OER). It was conducted with
   1196 university students who were enrolled in a general chemistry course
   with an experimental laboratory section. These students voluntarily used
   OER for their lab activities. Data were collected via a printed,
   18-question survey. Results showed that about half of the students were
   aware of the OER, and half of these informed students used it.
   Nonetheless, four advantages of the OER were determined: preparation for
   topic in advance, facilitating learning, time saving, and improving
   grades},

Abstract = {Cross national study on opinions on science teaching was revealed on a
   sample of 1799 (596 males, 1203 females) pre-service elementary and
   science teachers' enrolled in various departments at selected
   universities in Croatia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia
   and Turkey. Three factors explaining 43.4\% of variance were extracted
   from a pool of 22 items of affirmative statements. In combination with
   all three factors it was possible to construct a ghost teacher. Such
   teacher, constructed from the study, recognizes the importance of active
   student-centred teaching with respect to culture of the society, both in
   content and values, but will in practice teach with high achievements in
   mind and teacher centred practice as a vehicle towards success.
   Differences between teachers from different countries, between genders
   and between study tracks are statistically significant. The most
   influential factor determining opinions is the dominant teaching culture
   of the country.},

Abstract = {The popularity of science education is decreasing in certain parts of
   the world and negative attitudes toward science are common in learners
   from various cultures. Learners' interest in science and the
   effectiveness of their memory can be enhanced by utilizing modern
   concepts of an evolutionary-based approach in psychology.
   Survival-relevant information is, according to a number of authors,
   better retained than survival-irrelevant information. It is, however,
   unclear as to which degree the information retention is influenced by
   visual signs associated with danger. We experimentally manipulated
   danger information (genuine/ false information) and type of information
   (survival-relevant/survival-irrelevant) in a sample of 12-16 year old
   Slovak children. Information concerning dangerous animals was retained
   better than information about non-dangerous animals and
   survival-relevant information was retained better than
   survival-irrelevant information. The information itself, however, did
   not enhance memory scores, because false information about non-dangerous
   animals (i.e., presented as dangerous) led to lower scores than false
   information about dangerous animals (i.e., presented as non-dangerous).
   These results suggest that children adaptively retain survival-relevant
   information, but information retention is influenced by visual signs of
   danger. Utilisation of the evolutionary-based approach in science
   education is discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study, we discussed the participating teachers. implementation
   and understanding of science, technology, engineering and mathematics
   (STEM) project based learning (PBL). A research team at a STEM center
   systematically offered professional development activities to 92
   teachers in an urban school district in the southern U. S. To
   investigate the teachers. implementation and understanding of the STEM
   PBL pedagogy, we conducted a collective case study with five teachers.
   Study data included interviews, in-class observations, and lesson plans
   designed and implemented by the teachers. The results of this study
   indicated that the PD sessions were effective in communicating several
   important concepts about STEM PBL. Nevertheless, our observations
   revealed that five teachers. classroom enactments did not necessarily
   convey their understanding of STEM PBL.},

Abstract = {In the modern society with changeable information technology learning
   and applications, students could acquire information application
   knowledge, which is not worse than those taught by teachers in
   classrooms, through the Internet, distance conference, and e-learning.
   Traditional instruction therefore is facing great challenges. When
   measuring the distance learning efficiency of universities with DEA,
   appropriate inputs and outputs should be selected for effectively
   evaluating the system performance of DMUs. From the DEA results, the
   distance learning efficiency of Xian Jiaotong University, Huazhong
   University of Science \& Technology, Jiangnan University, Fujian Normal
   University, Beijing Normal University, Central South University,
   Chongqing University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Central China
   Normal University do not reach 1, not achieving the optimum, while
   Beijing Language and Culture University achieve the optimum.},

Abstract = {This paper gives an overview of research on modelling science competence
   in German science education. Since the first national German educational
   standards for physics, chemistry and biology education were released in
   2004 research projects dealing with competences have become prominent
   strands. Most of this research is about the structure of science
   competence as laid out in the standards. We first discuss the notion of
   competence in general and of science competence in particular. We then
   present a selection of results with respect to competence modelling.
   Finally, we critically review the impact of this research on teaching
   and show perspectives for future studies and classroom practise.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the findings of a study investigating junior
   secondary school students' perceptions of mathematics classroom learning
   environments in China. An adapted `What Is Happening In this Classroom?'
   questionnaire was administered to a sample of 2324 junior secondary
   school students from 72 classrooms in six provinces. Data were analyzed
   using factor analysis, descriptive statistics, two-way ANOVA, and
   cluster analysis. It was found that Chinese junior secondary students
   generally did not perceive their mathematics classroom environments very
   favorably. Grade 9 students were found to perceive their mathematics
   classroom learning environments less favorably than Grade 7 and Grade 8
   students did. Moreover, boys were found to perceive their mathematics
   classes as more inquiry-oriented and perceive themselves as relatively
   more mathematically involved, while girls perceived more opportunities
   for cooperation and knew what was needed to compete in mathematics
   classes. Three types of mathematics classroom learning environments,
   namely highly favorable, intermediately favorable, and lowly favorable
   as perceived by participants were further identified in this study.},

Abstract = {To initiate dialogue on empathy in science classroom, its role in
   science teaching, and to encourage science teacher education researchers
   and faculty to consider the role of empathy in science teaching, we
   conducted an instrumental collective case study with five science
   education graduate students at a Research-I university in the US. Data
   were collected through face-to-face semi-structured interviews.
   Within-case and across-case analyses were performed to interpret the
   data from the individual interviews and compare them with one and
   another. Our findings collectively speak to our participants'
   perspectives of empathy in science teaching. Finally, we discuss
   implications for teacher education and professional development and the
   need for learning sciences and science education research to
   systematically examine teacher empathy and student learning.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to establish what impact experimental work
   has on the understanding of scientific concepts, what pupils remember
   about the experiments they carried out and how they are able to
   formulate and understand the experiment plan. A sample of 386 pupils
   aged 13+ participated in the research, of which 162 in the experimental
   group conducted 5 experimental science activities. Instruments used with
   all pupils in this study include: pre-test, knowledge test, delayed
   knowledge test and questionnaire, while 39 of the pupils also took part
   in semi-structured interviews. The results show that 35.8 \% of pupils
   in the experimental group failed to write down at least one experiment
   they remembered from science classes, and none of remaining 64.2 \% of
   pupils that wrote down at least one experiment correctly described it.
   In addition, the results of the interviews show that only 2 pupils
   remembered the experiments from 5 experimental science activities three
   months after the experimenting without interviewer's help, and only 5
   pupils were able to adequately name and describe those experiments and
   interpret the experiments' findings. Although they were unable to
   describe the experiments, the students in the experimental group scored
   higher on the test and the delayed test than the pupils in the control
   group with a statistically significant difference. The results of the
   survey also show that pupils believe experiments to be the most popular
   part of science classes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships between
   teachers' attitudes toward science, knowledge and beliefs about inquiry,
   and science classroom teaching practices. Specifically, the study
   addressed three questions: What are teachers' beliefs and knowledge
   about inquiry? What are teachers' teaching related classroom practices?
   Do teachers' knowledge and beliefs about inquiry relate to their science
   classroom practices? The sample consisted of 34 teachers drawn randomly
   from schools in the city of Lebanon. To answer the first question,
   teachers responded to two questionnaires: Views of Science Inquig which
   gauged teachers' views about science and how science is conducted and
   Attitudes and Beliefs about the Nature of and the Teaching of Science
   which measured teacher's attitudes and beliefs about the nature of and
   the teaching of science. To answer the second question, classroom
   observations documented actual teaching practices. Results from the
   questionnaires and the observation were used to construct individual
   teacher's profiles which were used to identify relationships between
   teachers' beliefs, knowledge, and teaching practices. Results showed
   that most teachers had restricted views of nature of science and
   unfavorable beliefs and attitudes about inquiry. Moreover, no consistent
   relationships between teachers' beliefs, views of nature of science, and
   classroom practices were found.},

Abstract = {The present study tries to identify the `picture in mind' that students'
   have about defining, proving and modelling. We access to it through
   external representations of their mental representations; in particular,
   from the way in which these representations are expressed in written
   form (sentences and situations). In the study we have identified
   different ways of considering defining, proving and modelling:
   superficial, utilitarian and intrinsic, which were maintained by some
   students for the three elements in the different written
   representations. This coherence can be perceived as a characteristic of
   students' mathematical understanding. Our results provide an analytical
   scheme whose domain goes beyond the way of students' approaching to the
   mathematical elements considered in the study.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of activity based
   learning on sixth grade students' mathematics achievement in comparison
   to traditional learning, and determine their attitudes towards
   activities. Experimental research design with pretest-posttest control
   group was applied in the study. The participants, which included 78
   sixth grade students, were previously divided into two groups by random
   assignment. One group received traditional learning and the other group
   received activity based learning. The study was carried out for four
   weeks on the mathematics subject of ``integers{''}. For collecting data
   the mathematics success test and the Likert type attitudes towards
   mathematics activities scale were used as pretest and posttest. As a
   result, the academic achievement for both groups were positive
   increased. On the other hand, while the attitudes towards activities of
   students' in the experiment group decreased significantly, they
   increased in the control group.},

Abstract = {With the aim of giving new skills to engage their students with exciting
   new resources and of supporting teachers in their work to implement IBSE
   (Inquiry Based Science Education) in their classrooms, at the
   universities of Milan and Salerno various didactical activities for high
   school teachers have been planned and implemented in the last years. In
   particular, the Physics Education Research Group of Milan, one of the 13
   partners of the European project TEMI (Teaching Enquiry with Mysteries
   Incorporated), has planned and organized a training session with a group
   of 34 high school teachers that have been held in Salerno. Teachers have
   been involved in directly making them experience the 5E inquiry
   methodology to be tested in their classes. Teachers have been engaged by
   a suitably chosen physics mystery and fostered to explore, to discover
   and find explanations of the mystery in order to practice scientific
   investigation. All the IBSE activities proposed had the main purpose of
   reducing the gap between standard high school practice and well-known
   education techniques, by offering concrete strategies and specific tools
   for physics teaching. In this work, we will briefly describe our
   training experience and outline teachers' practice in their classrooms.},

Abstract = {The use of film as supplementary materials in the classroom has become
   common for higher education teachers of environmental studies. It is,
   however, rare that film is incorporated as the primary instructional
   medium. This paper reports a case study on a documentary film-based
   environmental studies course which sought to engage students in
   exploring and reflecting on a wide range of locally significant
   environment issues. While film is the focus of the course, post-film
   reflective discussion is an integral part in order to help students
   identify and clarity their thoughts and ideas. A pre and post survey and
   post-instruction interviews were carried out with two cohorts of
   university students for the purpose of evaluating this course. The
   results suggest that, using documentaries to repeatedly expose students
   to real issues, the course proved to be beneficial to developing
   students' perspective-taking and critical thinking abilities and sense
   of relevance, which collectively leads to a more pro-environmental
   disposition.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to reflect the description of teachers
   working in the secondary schools of TRNC on the managerial effectiveness
   skills of school administrators from the same schools and to identify
   whether their managerial effectiveness skills vary significantly on the
   basis of some variables. The research was conducted on a study group
   (sample) comprised of 369 teachers from 10 secondary schools. The study
   is a descriptive research conducted through screening with quantitative
   method. The Scale for Evaluation of the Effectiveness of School
   Administrators developed by Kocak and Helvaci (2011) was used as the
   data collection tool for this study with 3/5 dimensions. The research
   data were analysed through SPSS 23.0 software; and descriptive
   statistical processes were utilised as one-way analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) was performed to identify whether the effectiveness of school
   administrators under three parameters vary with regard to the service
   period based on the views of teachers; and t-test whether vary with
   regard to their genders. Pursuant to the research findings, the
   effectiveness levels under the culture of school and climate was found
   as 3.86 as the highest and 3.80 as the lowest for their effectiveness
   levels during the educational leadership. Consequently, the managerial
   effectiveness skills of school administrators were found at sufficient
   levels.},

Title = {Making It Count: Strategies for Improving Problem-Solving Skills in
   Mathematics for Students and Teachers' Classroom Management},

Abstract = {Understanding a problem is as important as solving it to understand the
   meaning of mathematics. It is a widespread view that problem-solving
   skills help individuals to overcome the problems easily in their daily
   lives. An individual with problem-solving skills is a self-confident,
   creative and independent thinker. It can be explicable that the
   societies formed by these individuals can easily solve the problems. In
   this vein, this study is aimed to determine the relationship between the
   acquisition of problem solving skills that play an important role in
   mathematics alongside two dimensions of classroom management which are
   time management and plan-program management. It is thought that there is
   a close relationship between these two dimensions; problem solving
   skills. The types of problems are divided into two; routine and
   non-routine. The aim is to get opinions about how these problems will be
   taught by mathematics teachers, at what level they will be used in class
   and what methods they will use for them. The study was conducted by
   doing a content analysis of qualitative research methods. The sample
   group which is randomly determined from five provinces of North Cyprus
   is composed of mathematics teachers who teach at the 9th grade level.
   The data was collected through semi-structured interview forms. Content
   analysis technique was used in the evaluation of the obtained data. As a
   result, it was found out that the mathematics teachers who work in the
   Ministry of National Education and teach at the 9th grade, have been
   given importance to problem-solving skills such as, problem-solving
   duration and problem-solving methods in their classes. In addition, the
   teachers pointed out that the time given is not sufficient at schools
   and they could not give enough importance to plan-program activities.
   They also pointed out that although the annual and monthly plans
   specified by the Ministry, the desired variety of questions could not be
   provided by different methods.},

   assessing the ability of financial resources allocation. The validity of
   financial resources allocation is different from the efficiency of

Abstract = {This research was done in order to investigate the effects of the social
   skill training program on the social skill levels of young people in the
   age of military service in Cyprus. The sample of the investigation
   consists of 68 young people, who were applied to the military service in
   2015. In order to determine social skill levels of the participants,
   Social Skill Inventory (SSI) was used. And the effects of the social
   skill training program on the social skill levels of participants were
   analyzed by the experimental method, which was based on pre-test and
   post-test model. As a result of the comparison, there were significant
   differences found between the pre-test scores of the test group before
   the execution of social skill training program and post-test scores
   after the execution of social skill training program. In the light of
   the data, it was concluded that the social skill training program has a
   positive impact on the social skill level of participants.},

Title = {The Effectiveness of Using Stereoscopic 3D for Proportion Estimation in
   Product Design Education},

Abstract = {In product design education, identifying proportion and manipulating
   proportional relationships are important practices in form-giving
   training. However, using conventional 2D displays with monocular depth
   cues to train students with different spatial abilities remains a great
   challenge. Although, some literature has indicated that stereoscopic 3D
   (S3D) displays were helpful for depth-related tasks, whether S3D is
   helpful for proportion estimation is an open question. Therefore, the
   objective of this research was to study whether using S3D for design
   department students could assist them in improving their ability to
   interpret the proportions of products. The independent variables of the
   experiment included spatial ability, task complexity, and display mode.
   Spatial ability was a between-subject variable. Students aged 20-25
   years were recruited as participants and were categorized into high-,
   moderate-, and low-performance groups depending on their score on a
   spatial ability scale. Task complexity and display mode were
   within-subject variables. In the experiment, three chair styles were
   used as samples. Digital models of three chairs with distinct
   proportions were displayed in two conditions: 2D mode with monocular
   depth cues and S3D mode. Participants were asked to compare the
   proportions of a physical chair and three digital chairs and then select
   the digital chair with the correct proportions in the 2D and S3D modes.
   The dependent variable were the score of selecting the 3D digital models
   with correct proportions compared to the physical objects. The result
   indicated that students could perceive proportions more accurately in
   the S3D mode than in the 2D mode. In particular, when using S3D,
   participants with low spatial ability demonstrated overall performance
   that was equal to that of participants with high spatial ability.},

Abstract = {The availability and accessibility of disposable items has contributed
   immensely to our littering behaviour as humans. People discard plastic
   containers, paper wrappers and other items by throwing them onto the
   ground, thus aggravating the problem of littering. This study aims to
   assist the relevant stakeholders in integrating environmental awareness
   activities into the school curriculum, to drastically reduce littering
   in communities. Underpinned by developmental action theory and applied
   participatory paradigms, the study purports to assess the success of
   environmental action research campaigns aimed at combatting littering.
   Fourteen learners from seven classes served as co-researchers, having
   been randomly selected as participants in this study. Participants'
   observations and pictures were used to collect data, before resorting to
   coding and analysis. The results of the study show an improvement in
   learners' awareness of littering, allowing the authors to conclude that
   action research, if employed in environmental education, can raise
   learners' awareness pertaining to littering. A lack of environmental
   programmes in schools is also to blame for the fact that children often
   unwittingly litter or pollute their environment.},

Abstract = {The current importance of the research stems from the fact it identifies
   the reasons regarding translators' and interpreters' attitudes towards
   math tools and methods in their training program curriculum, and there
   has been no previous research on the topic. Another point to be
   mentioned in this regard is that research data and findings contribute
   to the overall significance of reliability, validity, and objectivity of
   the measurement and interpretation of the data within the landscape of
   multifaceted Humanities studies in general, and theoretical and applied
   aspects of professional activities in the field of Translation and
   Interpretation, in particular. The goal of the research is to explore
   the attitudes to the above-mentioned tools and methods as part of
   academic curriculum regarding Russian graduates of Master's programs on
   Translation and Interpretation. The goal was reached through a number of
   steps, including the analysis of the MA programs on Translation and
   Interpretation curriculum within the international framework, the
   identification of general trends regarding graduates' perception and the
   study of those components that shape their attitudes. The research
   methodology combined theoretical studies, qualitative and quantitative
   types of analysis. The empirical data was collected through the survey
   of graduates of various Russian universities who were part of Academia
   or Industry related to Translation and Interpretation. Cluster, factor,
   discriminant types of analysis were implemented. The SPSS was used for
   data processing. The research results confirmed the hypothesis that
   graduates' attitudes to mathematical tools and methods in general and to
   the respective module inclusion in the University-based translator and
   interpreter' training in particular depend on the two following factors.
   First, it is quality of MA program students completed in terms of the
   program module/course on math tools and methods for translation studies
   and second, graduates' working requirements. The research significance
   derives from the confirmed importance of the curriculum that should
   integrate research, math tools, technology and employers' requirements.
   Moreover, the research specified the above curriculum particular
   requirements regarding translators and interpreters.},

Abstract = {The research proposes an analytic framework to configure the policy
   portfolio for diffusing knowledge embedded in higher-education
   institutes. A modified Delphi method was first proposed to derive the
   key factors for enabling and enhancing the diffusion mechanism. The
   influence relationships between these factors were derived using the
   Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). The analytic
   network process (ANP) derived weights associated with the key factors.
   Finally, the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) was used to derive the
   policy instruments based on the Grey Relationships between the key
   factors and the policy instruments. An empirical study based on
   Taiwanese higher-education institutes also/then verified the feasibility
   of the proposed analytic framework. These findings suggest that research
   and development activities, publications, and networks of academic
   exchange play primary roles in knowledge diffusion in higher-education
   institutions. Motivation, human resources, and investment are the most
   important policy instruments to use for improving knowledge diffusion in
   the higher-education system.},

Abstract = {Machine Learning is a scientific discipline that addresses learning in
   context is not learning by heart but recognizing complex patterns and
   makes intelligent decisions based on data. Currently, students have to
   face the problem of selecting the best suitable university for admission
   in engineering. There is no predictor system that recommends the
   students to select the specific category which is best to its academic
   career. Students have to first appear in the entry test and can't
   predict whether he/she can pass the entry test to get admitted in
   University. To tackle this problem the field of Machine Learning
   develops algorithms that discover knowledge from specific data and
   experience, based on sound statistical and computational principles.
   After going through the entry test students have to face problems for
   selecting the preferences among different categories due to the lack of
   knowledge of intake merits of preceding years. Another problem arises
   when students are waiting for admission in specific university,
   meanwhile, other universities finish their admission processes and
   select the students, but some students can't take admission in any
   university due to no prediction system for admission in universities. In
   this work, we would like to develop an E-Assessment and Computer-Aided
   Prediction online system that enables the student to predict the entry
   test numbers by giving the Metric and Intermediate marks and other
   academic numbers. The suggested scheme has been demonstrated to perform
   at the maximum speed under MATLAB setup.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the two primary school science teachers'
   conceptions of professional development, their perceptions of
   self-improvement and the factors influencing their professional
   development. In this investigation, a case study approach was adopted.
   The participant teachers were given a semi-structured interview and the
   data collected was qualitatively analyzed. After individual case
   analysis, cross-case analysis was carried out to compare the
   participants' conceptions of professional development, their perceptions
   of self-improvement and the factors influencing their professional
   development. The findings of the study revealed that the two teachers
   viewed professional development as an individual process rather than
   collaborative. They perceived their professional development locally
   practiced and self-renewed, gained with the help of self critical
   reflection. They also emphasized that the in-service training courses
   offered to them by the Ministry of Education do not respond to their
   needs. Thus, they cannot get the maximum benefit from them. The findings
   of this study has a significant contribution in drawing a clearer
   picture of the professional development endeavours the teachers get
   engaged into and the nature of the professional development in Northern
   Cyprus context. The findings of this study also indicated that there is
   a need to develop teacher development programs where teachers are also
   involved in the decision making process and constructivist stance is
   adopted that puts the teachers in the center of learning and development
   process.},

Abstract = {The key to improve comprehensive national strength is to training more
   innovative talents. At present, the teaching mode of China's civil
   engineering focuses on pouring the knowledge, which leads to the
   dissociation between class and practical case. As an innovation tool,
   TRIZ theory has been widely used in worldwide enterprises, however,
   there is scarce analysis on its application in training innovative
   talents in universities and colleges as a training method of innovative
   thinking and innovative ability. Regarding the shortage in training
   civil engineering talents, this paper based on RIZ Theory, proposed
   training methods of innovative talents of China Civil Engineering;
   Strengthening the establishment of teaching staff of civil engineering
   based on TRIZ theory; Initial the course of TRIZ Innovation Theory for
   civil engineering major; Applying TRIZ theory into civil engineering
   class; Building TRIZ based platform for practicing innovative method;

Abstract = {Handling and analyzing to web financial data is becoming a challenge
   issue in knowledge management and education to accounting practitioners.
   eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), which is a type of web
   financial reporting, describes and recognizes financial items by tagging
   metadata. The goal is to make it possible for financial reports to be
   handled accurately and to be analyzed automatically via human-computer
   interactive approach. To solve the issues that analyzing financial data
   might create, (1) a decidable Tableau algorithm for description logic
   DLRBR is proposed; (2) a formalization approach about part-whole
   relationship in XBRL is proposed; (3) consistency checking and logical
   reasoning of XBRL metadata is discussed; (4) then a human-computer
   interactive prototype system is developed to verify the proposed method.
   The results can help prompting the ability of knowledge management and
   education in accountings.},

Title = {K-means Clustering to Study How Student Reasoning Lines Can Be Modified

Abstract = {Research in Science Education has shown that often students need to
   learn how to identify differences and similarities between descriptive
   and explicative models. The development and use of explicative skills in
   the field of thermal science has always been a difficult objective to
   reach. A way to develop analogical reasoning is to use in Science
   Education unifying conceptual frameworks.
   In this paper we describe a 20-hour workshop focused on Feynman's
   Unifying Approach and the two-level system. We measure its efficacy in
   helping undergraduate chemical engineering students explain phenomena by
   applying an explanatory model. Contexts involve systems for which a
   process is activated by thermally overcoming a well-defined potential
   barrier. A questionnaire containing six open-ended questions was
   administered to the students before instruction. A second one, similar
   but focused on different physical content was administered after
   instruction. Responses were analysed using k-means Cluster Analysis and
   students' inferred lines of reasoning about the analysed phenomena were
   studied. We conclude that students reasoning lines seem to have clearly
   evolved to explicative ones and it is reasonable to think that the
   Feynman Unifying Approach has favoured this change.},

Abstract = {A method was proposed in this study for assessing the interface
   operating efficiency of a remote control. The operating efficiency of a
   product interface can be determined by the proposed approach in which
   the related dimensions of human palms were measured. The reachable range
   (blue zone) and the most comfortable range (green zone) were
   investigated when a user used a single hand (right hand) to operate the
   remote controls. After that, new remote control designs were created
   based on the measurement results and the operating efficiency of
   commercially available remote controls were determined for comparison.
   The operating efficiency is determined by calculating the overall
   distance of finger movements when manipulating the buttons and the
   overall operation time was recorded. The subjects who joined the body
   measurements and performed the experiments are right-hander Asian
   college students between the ages of 22 and 28. After further
   optimization, the reachable range became more average during one-handed
   operations and those frequently used keys were included into the
   comfortable range. The resulting operating efficiency performance is
   higher than commercially available products. The results serve as a good
   reference for detailed modifications of the products or for the decision
   making of design proposals.},

   important to find out the problem as to why the attitudes are relatively
   negative. The research was focused on Czech lower secondary and
   secondary grammar school pupils' attitudes to the subject of chemistry.
   Also, the difference between groups of variables (gender and grade) was
   examined. The sample size contained 931 Czech lower secondary and
   secondary grammar school pupils. The research tool was a questionnaire
   with 25 Likert type items. By the use of factor analysis, the items were
   distributed into four categories: 1) Popularity and difficulty of
   chemistry, 2) The relevance of chemistry, 3) Chemical aids and
   laboratory experiments, 4) The future life and chemistry. The overall
   score indicated neutral/slightly positive pupils' attitude toward
   chemistry. Girls received a lower score in comparison with boys in all
   grades, except the 1st grade, in secondary grammar schools. The opposite
   situation was among lower secondary school pupils, where girls achieved
   a slightly higher attitude score. It is possible to say that negative
   attitudes toward chemistry are also among lower secondary and secondary
   grammar school pupils, so it is needed to try to improve attitudes
   toward chemistry from the early age of pupils. The recommendations for
   the pedagogical practice are suggested in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {The current main research trend in mathematics education is publishing
   studies by Western scholars pertaining to educational issues of the
   world in general. but Asia is mostly overlooked. Since international
   comparisons show Asian students outperform others in mathematics, the
   imbalance should receive more attention. To gain insight into this
   disparity, this study surveys all theoretical and empirical articles
   published by Journal for Research in Mathematics Education (JRME),
   Educational Studies in Mathematics (ESM), and Mathematical Thinking and
   Learning (MTL) from 2000 to 2012. Issues regarding westernization vs.
   internationalization of mathematics education and how to build a
   self-identity in research in mathematics education are addressed. A
   sociocultural framework for conducting and publishing educational
   research in mathematics is needed to develop multicultural perspectives.},

Abstract = {A critical component of teacher effectiveness is how teachers notice
   students' misconceptions and adjust the instructional approach
   accordingly. Taking a stance that the teachers' instructional quality is
   crucial to students' learning, a qualitative international comparison
   study was performed to examine science teachers' perceptions of and
   their approaches toward students' misconception on photosynthesis
   between the United States ( US) and South Korea. A web-based on-line
   survey consisting of open-ended questions was administered to secondary
   science teachers and 85 and 81 teacher responses were collected from the
   US and Korea, respectively. Constructed responses were analyzed using
   the constant comparative method and enumerative approach through which
   regularities and patterns in the responses emerged. Four categories
   emerged concerning teacher perceptions of misconceptions: Concept,
   Knowledge Construction, Curriculum, and Pedagogical. Most teachers
   employed Concept or Knowledge Construction perspective to identify and
   reason out student misconceptions in both countries. In respect to
   instructional strategies, two dominant patterns emerged: content-focused
   and student-focused strategies. Teachers from both countries
   demonstrated the most frequent use of content-centered approaches,
   although the patterns of the usage in relation to their perceptions
   towards misconceptions were different to some degree. Possible
   attributing factors for the observed patterns and some limitations of
   the study are further discussed.},

Abstract = {Students' learning is assumed to be promoted through peer-group
   discussion. Most studies show the presence of qualitative improvements
   in either oral or written reasoning as a result of such interactions.
   However, knowledge on the relationship between talk qualities and text
   qualities is scarce. We adopt an explorative design using statistical
   analyses of students' talk and texts to estimate the relationships
   between theoretically-based concepts of attitude and sociolinguistic
   code. The operationalized concepts can be validated using statistical
   analyses. Linear regression shows that Elaborated code in students' talk
   has no impact on students' texts. Furthermore, Restricted code in talk
   is detrimental to students' use of Elaborated code in texts. This
   relationship is also found at the group level. Students' expression of
   open-mindedness in their texts depends on their use of Elaborated code.
   Teachers must support students in using Elaborated code in their texts
   and avoiding Restricted code in their talk.},

Title = {Exploring how Korean teacher's attitudes and self-efficacy for using

Abstract = {Demographic trends in Korea indicate that the student population is
   becoming more diverse with regards to culture, ethnicity and language.
   These changes have implications for science classrooms where
   inquiry-based, student-centered activities require culturally and
   linguistically diverse (CLD) students to connect with their peers and
   successfully navigate both everyday and content specific language. This
   study introduces the K-TASILT (Korean Teachers' Attitudes and
   Self-efficacy for Inquiry and Language based Teaching) questionnaire,
   which we designed to investigate Korean teachers' conceptions of
   diversity, inquiry teaching, and language education to help explore
   attitudes and self-efficacy towards teaching inquiry and language skills
   to CLD students. An analysis of 144 primary and secondary schools
   teachers' responses revealed that they have fairly positive attitudes
   towards CLD students and positive self-efficacy for teaching inquiry,
   but they also have limited self-efficacy for implementing effective
   language teaching supports for using inquiry teaching with CLD students.
   We raise questions about the ways in which teachers' attitudes and
   beliefs about inquiry teaching and language acquisition could shape
   teaching practices that limit or afford opportunities for CLD students
   to participate in school science. We offer implications for science
   teacher education programs in Korea focused on enhancing diversity and
   content specific strategies for supporting language learning.},

Abstract = {Process of communication can be challenging. At first participants must
   standardize their concepts of things to hold them close enough to
   others' concepts, then it's crucial to use appropriate expressions to
   verbalize those concepts to ensure the mutual understanding. Therefore,
   it can be problematic when cognitive constructs are hard to standardize,
   as in the case of creative process. That's because communicating about
   socially constituted objects is much easier than talking about those
   that are distinctive. Data in this study was gathered by qualitative
   survey with self-completed questionnaire of open-ended questions. It was
   conducted between students of creativity-related studies right after
   their creative work on a project. The aim of the study was to evaluate
   and observe proficiency in talking about one's ideas and communicate
   about creative process that led to them. The study has shown that
   creative process is identified only with its final phase - ideation.
   This ``big idea{''} is seen as the result of having talent, not as the
   result of analytical thinking. Over half of the respondents believe that
   their idea was created by accident.. Respondents don't see creative
   process as a common phenomenon, they only refer to it as an inner
   experience of a certain individual.},

Abstract = {Based on the characteristic feature parameterization and the superiority
   evaluation method (SEM) in extension engineering, a product-shape design
   method was proposed in this study. The first step of this method is to
   decompose the basic feature components of a product. After that, the
   morphological chart method is used to segregate the ideas so as to
   generate new product forms. Finally, the extension engineering method
   can be used to build the relationship between the feature parameters and
   the image vocabularies. With this method, designers are able to
   communicate with their clients via Internet and develop more suitable
   products for consumers by evaluating their impressions with the
   assistive system. It has been verified that this approach can reduce the
   development time as well as enhance the effectiveness and
   competitiveness of a new product.},

Abstract = {The current study applied cloud computing technology and smart mobile
   devices combined with a streaming server for parking lots to plan a city
   parking integration system. It is also equipped with a parking search
   system, parking navigation system, parking reservation service, and car
   retrieval service. With this system, users can quickly find parking lots
   near their destination, using various parking servers and the system
   center to connect to and integrate the cloud server. The computing power
   of the cloud servers transmits five of the closest parking lots with
   available parking spaces to a user's smart mobile device so the user can
   choose the most suitable parking lot. After users arrive at the parking
   lot, they can scan the information in the parking lot using an RFID
   indoor positioning system and the users' current location, so that the
   location of vacant parking spaces in the parking lot and moving vehicles
   will be displayed on their smart mobile device. In addition, the stored
   traffic flow record can provide local governments with statistics for
   building parking lots in the city in the future.},

Abstract = {The engineering design process has been largely implemented in a
   collaborative project format. Recently, technological advancement has
   helped collaborative problem solving processes such as engineering
   design to have efficient implementation using computers or online
   technology. In this study, we investigated college students' interaction
   and collaborative learning in the CSCL setting of performing engineering
   design tasks. To accomplish the research aim, this study compares
   participating learners' interaction between teams of high and low
   achievement. We gathered texts, images, and URL links, in their
   real-time chatting environments and tracked all the histories that
   mapped their logins and interactions. We conducted content and CORDTRA
   analyses on the students' online chat conversations. The content
   analysis results showed similar frequency patterns for both teams at
   each stage of the engineering design process in CSCL. On the other hand,
   the interactions by CORDTRA analysis showed different patterns in some
   stages of the engineering design process and the differences influenced
   each team's achievements. This study provided strategies on teachers'
   involvement for successful outcomes in engineering design of CSCL.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether specialized high school mathematics
   teachers, chosen to educate selected students, are mentally ready to
   integrate Fatih project technologies into their teaching. Forty
   mathematics teachers from randomly selected specialized and general high
   schools in Ankara responded to a survey comprising 31 items grouped
   under four measures of self-confidence in the technology domain. An
   independent t-test revealed no statistically significant difference
   between specialized and general high school teachers' self-confidence
   levels. We conclude that technological pedagogical content knowledge
   should be an essential criterion for selecting specialized school
   teachers, who educate the country's future innovators},

Abstract = {Korea has recently started to implement a STEM-like approach in K-12
   education, titled STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and
   Mathematics) curriculum, to educate the next generation of students to
   become creative innovators. As this approach has been shown to increase
   educational success, it is vital to prepare and develop interest in
   middle school students to participate in STEAM subjects-related learning
   opportunities. This study examined the impact of hands-on global climate
   change monitoring projects whose curriculum was designed based on the
   six structured inventive thinking (SSIT) approach that can facilitate
   the development of the knowledge of STEAM content and investigate the
   perceptions of STEAM subjects by middle school students. The
   participants in the study were sixty-eight grade 7 students from a
   middle school in Seoul, Korea. Employing a quasi-experimental research
   design, the participants were measured on their STEAM knowledge and
   perceptions before and after participation. The findings indicate that
   students who participated in global climate change monitoring activities
   reported gains in their STEAM content knowledge and showed an
   improvement in their perceptions of STEAM subjects. The latter finding
   was more pronounced for female students who had significantly higher
   science achievement and positive perceptions of the STEAM program than
   for male students. The results of this study suggest that carefully
   designed projects comprised of SSIT-based environmental activities can
   be effective in STEAM education at the middle school level.},

Abstract = {In South Africa, there is a strong curriculum imperative for South
   African school science teachers to not only involve learners in
   practical inquiry activities but also to support students in making a
   connection between the construction of substantive scientific knowledge
   to these activities. The research reported in this article investigated
   the extent to which South African teachers at historically disadvantaged
   township schools engaged students in the construction of science ideas
   in inquiry lessons. To this end, video transcripts of thirty two lessons
   were analysed and coded using a framework of student thinking lens
   developed by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) for the
   Science Teachers Learning from Lesson Analysis (STeLLA) project. The
   trends on the teaching features are explicated in the presentation of an
   in-depth analysis of a chemistry lesson. This research suggests the need
   for a re-alignment of inquiry-based science education with the
   development of science ideas.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the
   Project-Based Learning (PBL) method on undergraduate students'
   achievement and its association with these students' self-efficacy
   beliefs about science teaching and pinions about PBL. The sample of the
   study consisted of two randomly chosen classes from a set of seven
   classes enrolled in the Science Teaching Course in a Primary School
   Education Department of a State University in Turkey. The randomly
   assigned treatment group (n = 33) was instructed based on a PBL method.
   The control group (n = 33) was instructed through the use of a
   traditional teaching (TT) method. The Science and Technology Teaching
   Achievement Test (STTAT) and self-efficacy belief scale (SEBS) were used
   as pre- and post-test measures. The results showed that students in the
   treatment group produced better performance on the Post-SEBS and the
   Post-STTAT. The students in the treatment group expressed mostly
   positive opinions about the use of the Project-Based Learning method.},

Abstract = {The development of computers in the past two decades has resulted in the
   changes of education in enterprises and schools. The advance of computer
   hardware and platforms allow colleges generally applying distance
   courses to instruction that both Ministry of Education and colleges have
   paid attention to the development of Distance Learning. To improve the
   quality of distance learning and students' learning effectiveness in the
   investigated universities, quantitative survey with SPSS19.0 is applied
   to analyzing data in this study, in which Factor Analysis, Reliability
   Analysis, Regression Analysis, and Analysis of Variance are utilized for
   organizing and analyzing data. About 600 college students in Department
   of Public Administration are proceeded questionnaire survey, and 472
   valid copies are studied. The research findings show that 1.Distance
   Learning appears significantly positive effects on Curriculum
   Instruction in Learning Effectiveness; 2.Distance Learning presents
   notably positive effects on Technological Media in Learning
   Effectiveness; 3.Distance learning reveals remarkably positive effects
   on Curriculum Management in Learning Effectiveness; and, 4.demographic

Abstract = {The present paper gives an overview of research on heterogeneity and
   diversity in German chemistry classes. The terms ``heterogeneity{''} and
   ``diversity{''} are first explained before discussing specific studies.
   The different facets of heterogeneity and diversity are asserted.
   Finally, the focus will be placed on language and special needs since
   both of these dimensions are frequently discussed in the German context.
   A comparison between international and national research are given. The
   implications and suggestions not only for national but also for
   international science research are presented.},

Abstract = {How do students learn to explain? We take this exemplary research
   question for presenting two antagonist traditions in German mathematics
   education research and their synthesis in an ongoing video study. These
   two traditions are (1) the German Didaktik approach that can be
   characterized by its epistemologically sensitive analyses and
   specifications of mathematical contents, and (2) the interactionist
   approach. By presenting the theoretical framework and some empirical
   insights, the article shows that learning to explain can be
   conceptualized as increasingly participating in navigating practices
   through different epistemic fields.},

   conducted with mathematics and ML teachers and facilitators. The
   analysis shows that some teaching strategies are associated with

   to teaching strategies that are domain specific (mathematics and ML). I
   therefore ask what it means for teaching strategies to be domain

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine science students' and teachers'
   views of the provision and implementation of inquiry-based instruction
   in UAE secondary school science classes. Two instruments were developed
   and validated to collect participants' views of the provision and
   practice of inquiry-related activities. The findings suggested that both
   students and teachers believed that the curriculum materials lend
   themselves to supporting inquiry instruction, judging by the relatively
   high mean scores for both groups of participants with regard to the
   provision of inquiry activities, as described by the essential features
   of inquiry-based instruction. However, compared with their students,
   science teachers showed a statistically significant higher mean score
   with regard to the provision of curriculum materials in supporting
   implementation of inquiry instruction and a lower mean score with regard
   to the provision of integrated science processes in curriculum
   materials. Other similar trends were also detected, with teachers
   reporting statistically significant higher mean scores than their
   students with regard to opportunities to plan investigations, ask

Abstract = {This study constructed a marine science affect scale to understand
   junior high school students' emotions toward the ocean. This work
   comprised three stages. First, the researcher compiled factors and items
   associated with marine perception through an extensive literature
   review. Second, the compiled factors, the items of each factor, and
   their content validity were examined by eight experts, and a scale was
   constructed containing 7 items with 2 factors. Third, this was tested on
   a sample of 1,683 Taiwanese junior high students. The results from a
   series of multigroup confirmatory factor analyses supported the
   reliability, content and construct validity, and gender invariance of
   the questionnaire.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the evaluation
   indicators of teaching. The relevance of the present study is due to the
   problem of improving the quality of school education in the Russian
   Federation by means of renewal of the content of general education,
   provided by the RF State program ``Development of Education for
   2013-2020{''}. The vectors of updating are determined by the tasks of
   transition to the democratic and constitutional state, the market
   economy, the need to overcome the dangers of the country lagging behind
   global trends of economic and social development and, what is the most
   important, by the growing influence of the human capital on the economy
   of the country. The aim of this study is to identify the level of
   readiness of teachers to implement innovative forms of educational
   activities into the educational process with the help of the analysis of
   the responses of mathematics teachers to reflexive questions. The
   presentation of lessons with innovative forms during the methodical
   workshop and the systematic analysis of the experimental data are the
   main technologies. As a result of the experimental study, conducted in
   2015-2017 in the Kirov region with a group of 71 mathematics teachers we
   can present the experience of the implementation of innovative
   organization forms of educational process and summarize the results in
   the form of the subjective reflective assessment. The article justifies
   the high level of pedagogical readiness of mathematics teachers to
   introduce innovative forms of organization of educational activities
   such as: event-based learning, adaptive teaching, `bring your own
   devices', computational thinking, and stealth assessment.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a developed PSR model based on Chinese context is
   established to deal with the ecological vulnerabilities in western
   China. Judged by the model, we find that the essential way to
   pre-control the vulnerabilities is to evaluate it. Then a pre-control
   concept model is developed to evaluate and intervene the
   vulnerabilities. To carry out the pre-control model, we could use a
   series of evaluation equations to measure the single vulnerabilities,
   overall vulnerabilities, vulnerability changing trends, and the synergy
   degrees between the western ecological vulnerabilities and the
   performances of the local governments. Under the guidance of the
   evaluation results, the local governments and other organizations could
   choose the proper pre-control measures from the strategy matrix to
   respond to varied ecological vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {The relevance of this study is determined by the problem of developing
   various methods and techniques of analytic and synthetic activity with
   the aim of finding solutions to problems that involve the use of
   analysis and synthesis processes. Analytic and synthetic activity plays
   an important role in the process of cognition. The purpose of the study
   is to single out types of work aimed at forming analytic and synthetic
   activity skills in teaching the algebra course. The results of the
   study: the skills included in the analytic and synthetic activity are
   distinguished: to dismember the whole into its component parts; to
   establish relationships between parts of the whole (to distinguish the
   general and the different, the known and the unknown, the essential and
   the nonessential); to make up the whole from the parts, a new object
   from the individual elements; to draw up an action plan for solving the
   problem (task); to find errors and explain their reasons. Appropriate
   content-related components are revealed which are required for working
   with concepts, theorems, and tasks, and should be used to form analytic
   and synthetic activity skills in schoolchildren when studying algebra.
   The significance of the study: the materials of the article can be
   useful for heads of educational structures at various levels, school
   teachers, gymnasiums, lyceums, and parents.},

Abstract = {Phenomenography is a kind of teaching methodology put forward and used
   by the research team of education at University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
   It is between the macro level and the micro level. In recent years, the
   empirical study carried out with phenomenography in Western education
   research field has been widely accepted. At the same time, it is worth
   noting whether MOOC will overturn traditional teaching methods in
   university. This has always been a hot topic from the fanatical pursuit
   of MOOC to rational reflection upon it. Education researchers around the
   world all hope to explore a new teaching model to improve the quality
   and efficiency of modern tertiary education by virtue of the power of
   MOOC, which makes it possible to apply phenomenography to the MOOC
   teaching mode. This paper endeavors to carry out essential analysis on
   the quantity difference and qualitative difference involved in the
   individual experience phenomenon to improve the influential factors
   restricting MOOC itself, thus releasing the vitality of the micro
   subject (teachers and students) and making up for the limitations of
   MOOC compared with traditional teaching.},

Abstract = {Objective: Teaching practice is an organic part in the process of
   physical education, is the only way to foster a qualified sports
   teacher, and a main way to evaluate quality of talents cultivated by
   universities in an all-round manner. Method: In the paper, literature
   consultation, questionnaire survey and other methods were applied to
   investigate on physical education teaching practice status, and
   countermeasure study was made on problems in practice process and
   suggestions were put forward accordingly. Process: We conducted
   exploration from physical education teaching practice's trial teaching,
   practice preparation, practice school's basic information, practice
   schedule, practice location and advisors status, intern students' status
   as well as feedback by the end of practice in accordance with time
   sequence that intern students participated in teaching practice.
   Results: We found that there are some problems, such as low satisfaction
   with trial teaching, single way of intern students' practice units'
   selection, excessive concentrated practice bases, insufficient intern
   class hour for intern students, incomplete implementation of probation
   stage in teaching practice, irresponsible advisors and so on. By doing
   so, we would provide specific practice experience and theoretical
   evidence for standardizing and effectively promoting physical education
   teaching practice, and offer reference data for the progress of Chinese
   physical education.},

Abstract = {This study aims to discuss the effects of flipped teaching supported
   cooperative learning on MBA students' learning achievement, attitudes
   toward technology, cooperative learning attitudes, and course
   satisfaction in the mathematics and science education. By applying
   quasi-experimental research, 120 MBA students of a national university
   in China are selected as the research objects. Two classes are randomly
   sampled for a class as the experiment group (N = 75) and the other class
   as the control group (N = 45). The students in the experiment group
   apply flipped teaching supported cooperative learning, while those in
   the control group adopt traditional didactic cooperative learning. Both
   the experiment group and the control group are paired with heterogeneous
   cognitive styles for the 4-week (16 sessions) teaching experiment. The
   research results reveal that the flipped teaching supported cooperative
   learning could actually enhance students' learning achievement, course
   satisfaction, and cooperative learning attitudes in the science
   education. However, there is no significant effect between learning
   achievement, course satisfaction and cooperative learning attitudes. On
   the other hand, web-based learning self-efficacy would influence
   students' learning achievement and course satisfaction in the
   mathematics and science education.},

Abstract = {Motivation and job satisfaction of employees have been an important
   research area in recent years. Based on a case study on
   two-new-established colleges in one university located in China Beijing
   town, this study aimed to correlate and investigate the levels and
   factors affecting lecturers' motivation and job satisfactions in this
   university. The descriptive survey and co-relational methods were used.
   Seventy lecturers with 51.4 \% male and 48.6 \% female participated in
   the study. Data were analyzed by frequencies, percentages, means and
   Pearson' Linear Correlation Coefficient. Means were interpreted as poor,
   fair, satisfactory and very satisfactory. The motivational level of
   lecturers was satisfactory (average mean = 2.707, Std=.8014) mostly
   affected by Incentives \& promotions and salary. The level of job
   satisfaction was interpreted as satisfactory (average mean of 2.660,
   Std=.7804) mostly affected by financial reward. The correlation reported
   a significant relationship between lecturers' motivation and job
   satisfaction (r = 0.615 with the sig-value of. 000 lesser than .001).
   The continuity of lecturers' motivation was recommended by taking into
   consideration all analyzed factors.},

Abstract = {Linear Regression Model (LRM) is not only a time - hornored reserch
   method but a simple and essential analytical technique for social
   science researchers. However, it cannot reveal the meaning of the extrme
   value included in genuine data, which constitutes the major concern for
   researchers in social scineces. To solve this problem, most researhcers
   turned to quantile regression model. This model, hoever, is not only
   obscure because it divides data by quantile but difficult to perform
   because it needs special software. The study therefore proposed a new
   concept as well as method: equal part linear regression model (EPLRM)
   which divides the sample data into equal parts and builds LRM on each
   part so that the research can both observe the data distribution of
   sample data within each part and compare the results with that of LRM.
   As the case study shows, the poverty of fiscial expenditure on education
   would decrease Gross Nation Income (GNI) greatly and the promotion of
   educational input of private schools and social donation would boost the
   increase of GNI to a lage degree.},

Abstract = {It is wondered how traditional medical industry responds to the
   information era with new knowledge economy. In fact, medical industry is
   a knowledge-intensive and human-oriented service industry. The
   interaction among professional staff at various working systems in
   hospitals, patients visiting hospitals daily, and the upstream and
   downstream suppliers for medical activities forms an extremely useful
   knowledge database. Although the application of information technology
   is not the whole definition of knowledge management, the entire medical
   industry, based on other traditional factors, is not ranked on the top
   for the utilization of modern information technology, compared to other
   industries. For this reason, establishing a special knowledge management
   environment with the knowledge-intensive and human-oriented
   characteristics of medical industry is a worthy goal. Aiming at primary
   hospitals in Shanghai, the management level, physicians, and employees
   are distributed 360 copies of questionnaire. Total 288 valid copies are
   retrieved, with the retrieval rate 80\%. The research results summarize
   the positive relations between 1. leadership behavior and knowledge
   management, 2. knowledge management and organization innovation, and 3.
   leadership behavior and organization innovation. Finally, suggestions
   are proposed, expecting to have leaders in medical industry guide the
   organization to become a self-learning organism and, meanwhile, practice
   knowledge management in the organization to digitalize the generation,
   storage, and expansion process of knowledge within the organization.},

Abstract = {With increasing academic research in the past few decades, the knowledge
   scope of landscape architecture has expanded from traditional focus on
   aesthetics to a broad range of ecological, cultural and psychological
   issues. In order to understand how academic research and knowledge
   expansion may have redefined the practice, two surveys were conducted:
   one on Council of Educators in Landscape Architecture (CELA) in 2010
   (n=230, response rate=43\%), and another on the members of American
   Society of Landscape Architect (ASLA) in 2012 (n=239, sample rate=5\%,
   response rate=31\%). Results revealed that the scope of knowledge has
   expanded since 1970s in areas such as public welfare and personal
   pleasure. 2) The need for academic research is widely perceived in
   landscape architecture profession. 3) Academic research primarily
   generate explanatory knowledge, which has become an important supplement
   to judgmental design knowledge learned through systematic professional
   education and construction design knowledge learned through practice. 4)
   Practitioners believed that they use more logic thinking than intuition
   in their practice today, and expected more research to facilitate the
   former than the later.},

Abstract = {For industrial structure upgrading and modern service industry
   developing, China will need a large number of high-quality talents to
   contribute to new industrialization. China's higher education is
   important for cultivating high-quality, multi-skilled and well-trained
   talents. ``What Knowledge is of most Worth?{''} that raised by Herbert
   Spencer is one of the most typical questions for education. After
   investigation, this study researches 2 questions based on China's huge
   demand of well-trained, high-skilled, and application-oriented talents
   under current economic development: 1) ``What Knowledge is of most
   Worth?{''} Practical Scientific Knowledge. 2) The guidance on the
   education practice. The essay demonstrates the challenges and provides
   constructive suggestions including reform education curriculum,
   strengthen faculty and enhance university-enterprise cooperation which
   is multi-win for undergraduates, universities and enterprises. Based on
   the university-enterprise cooperation practice with company M, the
   experiences are summarized and the research results can be popularized.
   This thesis will analyze Herbert Spencer's ``What Knowledge is of Most
   Worth?{''}, and provide the helpful advices on practical scientific
   knowledge education based on Herbert Spencer's ``What Knowledge is of
   Most Worth?{''}},

Abstract = {This study examines how the use of a science inquiry activity in an
   environmental socio-scientific issue (SSI) impacts pre-service teachers'
   argumentative practice in two ways: social negotiation and epistemic
   understanding of arguments. Twenty pre-service science teachers
   participated in this study as a part of their science methods class.
   Small group discussions, while participating in an SSI debate, before
   and after engaging in a science inquiry activity, were collected as a
   main data source. The data were analyzed by an analytic framework
   adapted from both Toulmin's (1958) model of argument structure and
   Walton's (1996) reasoning scheme. The results indicate that the use of a
   science inquiry activity during SSI debate not only affects the
   teachers' social negotiation patterns, but also enhances their epistemic
   understanding. This study suggests that incorporating a science inquiry
   practice into an SSI debate has the potential to improve students'
   disciplinary engagement and the quality of their argumentative practice.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the process of participation
   in the transformative learning process for invasive species by community
   volunteers and voluntourists. The results show that children play an
   important role in motivating adults to accept new ideas, and for both
   community volunteers and voluntourists, ``dialogue{''} has an important
   influence on the relationship between self-reflection and new roles. In
   addition, during the operation of volunteer tourism, the platform
   provided by local intermediary organizations functioned to link
   stakeholders in volunteer tourism and promote transformative learning.},

Abstract = {In light of the challenges facing science educators and special
   education teachers in Singapore, this study entails design-based
   research to develop participatory learning environments. Drawing upon
   Vygotskian perspectives, this case study was situated in an informal
   workshop around the theme of ``day and night{''} working for Special
   Needs Students in Singapore. Moving away from traditional astronomy
   teaching, we aim to explore interdisciplinary multimodal modeling
   activities towards developing a participatory learning environment. As
   the main finings of this case study, the central benefits of
   interdisciplinary multimodal modeling activities are twofold: (1)
   promoting multiliteracies development using digital and multimodal
   resources for supporting the emotional and social experiences in
   developing learners' astronomical understanding; and (2) integrating
   learners' everyday experiences with scientific astronomical
   understanding for the development of higher cognitive functions. These
   findings emphasize the need for the cultural development of Special
   Needs Students.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the complaints and expectations of people living around
   the Neopolis wetland, which is an endangered area with international
   importance in Famagusta, Cyprus, in terms of the present situation of
   the wetland. For this purpose, 88 people (selfe-mployed, university
   students over 18 years of age, etc.) who live in the three streets and
   one main street parallel to the wetland were included in the working
   group. Open-ended questions were asked to the participants as required
   by qualitative research approaches. According to the research findings,
   it is seen that people have complaints about the present situation of
   the wetland and have expectations from the authorities and residents
   living there about its protection. It is observed that participants do
   not have sufficient awareness about the importance, protection and usage
   of the wetlands. In summary, it is found out that they required
   education about the environment and the wetland.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of comparison and game-challenge
   strategies on sixth graders' learning achievement of algebra variable,
   learning attitude towards algebra variable learning, and meta-cognitive
   awareness of algebra variable learning. A 2 x 2 factorial design was
   used, and 86 students were invited to participate in the experimental
   instruction and assigned to four groups: comparison with game-challenge,
   comparison, game-challenge, and control. The results showed that (1) a
   significant interaction effect was found on students' learning
   achievement of algebra variable: the comparison with game-challenge
   group performed significantly better than the comparison group and the
   game-challenge group respectively; (2) a significant interaction effect
   was found on students' learning attitude towards algebra variable: the
   comparison with game-challenge group responded significantly more
   positively than the comparison group and the gamechallenge group
   respectively; (3) a significant interaction effect was found on
   students' meta-cognitive awareness of algebra variable learning: the
   comparison with gamechallenge group reported significantly higher scores
   than the comparison group and the game-challenge group respectively.},

Abstract = {Students suffer academic procrastination while dealing with frequent
   deadlines and working under pressure. This causes to delay their
   coursework and may affect their academic progress, despite feeling
   worse. Triggering students' motivation, like introducing technologies,
   helps to reduce procrastination. In this context, Augmented Reality has
   been used before to stimulate learning in Engineering Education, and
   this study reveals that introducing this technology has also a visible
   effect in reducing academic procrastination. It was observed that this
   reduction was visible even after two different groups of students had
   worked in several tasks before introducing AR. However, it is not
   possible to conclude if the observed reduction is just caused by a
   novelty effect and cannot be maintained over time, or if it is linked to
   a more intrinsic attraction that students perceive for modern
   technologies that helps to reduce academic procrastination more
   consistently.},

Abstract = {In order for a smooth and problem-free transformation to take place in a
   digitalizing education system, efficient management is needed. Thus,
   educational managers need to improve their skills and develop behaviors
   suitable for taking education systems into the digital age. Social
   networks enable leaders to become digital citizens by embracing and
   implementing ``Open Leadership{''}. Acceptance of technology and
   self-efficacy in technological leadership are both seen as factors that
   can have positive or negative influences on the new leadership styles.
   This study aims to investigate the relationship between open leadership,
   digital citizenship, technology acceptance and self-efficacy in
   technological leadership. Working with a group of 153 education
   managers, the research was conducted using a relational screening model.
   Following multiple regression analyses, it was found that technology
   acceptance and self-efficacy in technological leadership positively
   influences digital citizenship at medium level and that self-efficacy in
   technological leadership and digital citizenship positively influences
   open leadership.},

Abstract = {Concepts change into mental images through individuals' experiences.
   Therefore, mental images can differ from culture to culture. This study
   aims to analyse students' mental images of cigarette through metaphors.
   This research uses phenomenology, one of qualitative research designs.
   The study group was composed of 986 secondary school, high school and
   university students chosen in purposeful sampling method. The
   participants were asked to complete the statement ``a cigarette is
   like..... because......{''} in order that their mental images might be
   revealed. The data were analyzed through content analysis. In
   consequence, 886 metaphors, 110 of which were different, were obtained.
   The metaphors were found to be grouped into 3 different categories.},

Abstract = {In the process of learning mathematics, students practice various forms
   of thinking activities aimed to substantially contribute to the
   development of their different cognitive structures. In this paper, the
   subject matter is a ``cognitive obstacle{''}, a phenomenon that occurs
   in the procedures of solving mathematical tasks. Each task in
   mathematics teaching should potentially be designed so that it contains
   requests that should be performed. Based on that, a cognitive obstacle
   that students face at the thought plan is created, as well as a
   cognitive challenge. In the process of ``overcoming a cognitive
   obstacle{''} in solving the assigned task in mathematics teaching, it is
   necessary for a student to make an adequate cognitive effort and to
   optimally engage reference part of the actual cognitive capacity. The
   process takes place through exercising different thinking activities
   (thinking operations), using the previous knowledge and experience in
   solving certain groups of tasks. A system of cognitive obstacles should
   be grounded in the teaching mathematics, in order to enable an adequate
   level of thought activization of students and the development of various
   mathematical cognitive micro-structures (abilities, skills, knowledge,
   etc.). It also enables students to develop and improve their capacity of
   mathematical thinking.},

Title = {The Teaching and Learning of Diffusion and Osmosis: What Can We Learn

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to describe the way in which two
   important biological phenomena, namely diffusion and osmosis, are
   addressed in the classroom. The study builds on extensive research
   conducted over the past twenty years showing that students'
   appropriation of these two phenomena remains partial and incomplete. To
   understand some of the difficulties these students face in understanding
   such concepts, we have geared our research toward analysis of classroom
   practices based on a theoretical framework involving general and
   specific dimensions of teaching science. Using a case study (a course
   made up of eight periods), we collected data in three stages: interviews
   with the teacher regarding his planning; a video recording of the entire
   course; and feedback interviews with the teacher subsequent to the
   course. The study's results show that the difficulties encountered by
   the students cannot be attributed solely to their personal
   characteristics (state of development of the scientific mindset, prior
   learning, etc.). Instead, they appear to be largely associated with
   teaching practices and the potential these practices hold in terms of
   allowing students to appropriate these concepts. The results presented
   in this article are significant in their contribution to improving
   teaching methods for diffusion and osmosis, and thus to facilitating
   their understanding by students. The paper also presents an example of a
   conceptual and methodological framework for the study of classroom
   practices with a view to addressing the gap between educational research
   and classroom practice.},

Abstract = {The combination of social media and invert teaching is a new path to
   inverting interation technology education and reconstructing the
   curriculum of context. In this paper, based on the theory of
   constructivism learning, a model named Mobile Inverted Constructivism
   (MIC) is provided. Moreover, in view of the functional quality of social
   media in China, the Mobile Inverted Constructivism system (MICs) is
   designed on the platforms of WeChat and Baidu Post Bar. Through a
   interaction design course, examines the teaching effect of MIC model.
   The statistical software SAS9.3 was used to analyze the experimental
   data. Experimental results show that in the classes where the MIC model
   is applied, students are better motivated to learn and make creative
   achievements than those restrained by traditional classroom teaching,
   and the MICs is more acceptable to the digital natives. In the future,
   the MIC model will be further improved, to better embody the ``culture
   of sharing{''}.},

Abstract = {Technology and innovation are the power of human civilization. In face
   of such a changeable era, the rapid development and circulation of
   information technology has hastened the diversification of society. To
   cope with the approach of information society, teaching methods should
   also be changed, as traditional injection education could no longer
   adapt to the changing society. Different from the face-to-face lecturing
   in traditional classrooms, learners at different places could still
   precede ``face-to-face{''} like instruction through synchronous
   web-based instruction. It is expected to promote students' creativity.
   Taking teachers and students of public and private universities in
   Kaohsiung City as the sampling subjects, 600 copies of questionnaires
   are distributed. Total 428 valid copies are collected, with the
   retrieval rate 71\%. The research results are concluded as following. 1.
   Synchronous web-based instruction would affect thinking styles. 2.
   Synchronous web-based instruction would influence creativity. 3.
   Thinking styles reveal notably positive effects on creativity. The
   research results and suggestions are expected to have teachers change
   the teaching methods in order to promote students' creativity.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the differences between Finnish
   and Taiwanese textbooks for grades 7 to 9 on the topic of solving
   systems of linear equations (simultaneous equations). The specific
   textbooks examined were TK in Taiwan and FL in Finland. The content
   analysis method was used to examine (a) the teaching sequence, (b)
   application types, (c) representation forms, (d) response types, and (e)
   level of cognitive demand. The main difference between the Finnish and
   Taiwanese textbooks was that the Finnish textbooks introduced the topic
   of linear systems using a graphical approach, while the Taiwanese
   textbooks used an algebraic approach. Results also showed that the
   Taiwanese textbooks had fewer problems, but more challenging problems
   requiring a higher level of cognitive demand; the Finnish textbooks had
   more authentic application problems, and even more problems were
   displayed in visual forms. In addition, the Taiwanese textbooks had more
   open-ended problems, particularly problems asking students to explore or
   explain, whereas the Finnish textbooks did not have exploration
   problems. The topic of linear systems was also taught earlier in
   Taiwanese textbooks. Implications of this study and suggestions for
   future studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {The present study examines levels of satisfaction and perceptions of the
   students taking the blended anatomy course in Turkish Higher Education
   System. 15 students selected from 213 medical students participated in
   the study. An interview form was designed to identify the views of the
   students about the present study. The interview results were analyzed in
   the NVIVO program using the content analysis technique. Based on the
   results, the medical students' views on the blended anatomy course were
   classified into 8 categories: 1) visuality 2) content 3) effective
   learning 4) expectations from blended learning 5) accessibility 6)
   motivation 7) new perspective for the students and 8) continuity.
   Results indicate that medical students perceive blended learning
   environment positively. As a factor promoting learning, this study makes
   suggestions for taking advantage of the opportunities in a blended
   anatomy course successfully.},

Title = {Do Students Trust in Mathematics or Intuition during Physics Problem
   Solving? An Epistemic Game Perspective},
Journal = {EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate (1) students' trust in mathematics
   calculation versus intuition in a physics problem solving and (2)
   whether this trust is related to achievement in physics in the context
   of epistemic game theoretical framework. To achieve this research
   objective, paper-pencil and interview sessions were conducted. A
   paper-pencil test was administered to 83 freshmen students. In
   paper-pencil test students were asked to calculate accelerations of four
   vehicles with different masses doing a drag race and to indicate which
   vehicle would win the race. Analyses revealed two themes: (1) ``Math
   does not lie!{''} (for 43\% of students) and (2) ``Intuition does not
   mislead!{''} (for 57\% of students). Interview analysis revealed that
   students' trust in mathematics calculation stems from the convincing and
   realistic nature of calculations and the misleading nature of intuitive
   knowledge. It was found that students' trust in intuitive knowledge
   stems from their intuitive expectations. The findings also revealed a
   significant association between students` trust in mathematics
   calculation and their achievement in the general physics course.},

Abstract = {Derivatives and integrals are two important concepts of calculus which
   are precondition topics for most of mathematics courses and other
   courses in different fields of studies. A majority of students at the
   undergraduate level have to master derivatives and integrals if they
   want to be successful in their studies However, students encounter
   difficulties in the learning of derivatives and integrals. Most of these
   difficulties arise from the students' weakness in problem solving. This
   paper presents a learning strategy which has been designed to overcome
   these difficulties based on mathematical thinking and generalization
   strategies with prompts and questions.},

Abstract = {Research has addressed what instructional conditions may inhibit or
   promote scientific argumentation. Little research, however, has paid
   attention to interpersonal factors that influence collaborative
   argumentation. The present study examines the ways interpersonal factors
   affected group dynamics, which influence the features of collaborative
   argumentation among three groups of students of different ability as
   they collaborated to explain a complex scientific question. We
   transcribed and coded videotapes of three groups of 7th grade students
   while they performed an online science investigation and explanation.
   Methods included contextual analysis, discourse mapping, and qualitative
   case comparison. The results suggested that the clear goal of task
   completion allowed a single member to dominate group discussions, which
   prevented substantive argumentation. Students were mainly concerned
   about task identification and talked less about the meaning of their
   data. Our analyses suggest that social conflict may promote more
   substantive argumentation. We discuss ways to support more sustained
   argumentation during collaboration.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of anchored
   instruction on the students in secondary school math studies classrooms.
   This study adopted a quasi-experimental design. This research involved
   both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the effects of
   anchored instruction on students' academical achievement, permanence and
   perceptions about anchored instruction method. Tests used were; before
   performing the unit pre-test, after completing the unit post-test and to
   determine the permanence of the information that has been learned
   permanence-test. Overall, the findings suggest that the students in the
   experimental group were more successful than students who were taught
   traditional method in control group. In addition, content analysis
   results showed that this method was fun and effective for learning.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to examine the effects of
   Problem-Solving Strategy Steps (PSSS) on students' achievement, skill,
   and confidence. The study was conducted in a two-year college classroom
   with 70 students from two different groups enrolled in a physics course.
   One of them was randomly selected as an experimental group (EG) and the
   other was the control group (CG). The students included in the EG were
   instructed by PSSS and traditional instruction while the students in the
   CG were instructed by only traditional instruction. The study was
   conducted in Newtonian Mechanics. The data of the research were
   collected with the Physics Achievement Test (PAT), the Problem-Solving
   Strategy Steps Survey (1P4S), and the Problem-Solving Confidence
   Questionnaire (PSCQ). The results indicated that there was a significant
   difference between the means of the EG and the CG in favor of the EG.
   Also, the use of problem-solving strategy steps contributed to the
   critical and analytical skills of the students.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined whether the constructs of usefulness,
   motivation, likeness, confidence, and anxiety influence the student's
   attitude towards statistics. Two hundred ninety eight students enrolled
   in the private university were surveyed by using the questionnaire
   proposed by Auzmendi (1992). Data analysis was done by structural
   equation model AMOS software. The results support the model proposed by
   Auzmendi of five factors, however the data reveal that there exists an
   alternative model (CFI = 0.907) that best fits the proposed model (CFI =
   0.885). Furthermore, of the 25 indicators proposed only 22 have an
   acceptable range and two of the indicators (Items 9 and 2) should be
   considered in the construct of anxiety and usefulness respectively.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the concern of science course whose mothers'
   completed parenting education programme 3 years ago. The parenting
   education programme was about families who had children 7-11 years old.
   The investigation was done with 4 mothers. This case study were examined
   with 3 semi-structured questions. The analysis of data is done with
   content analysis. The questions focused on to learn concern of science
   courses behind to childrens' attitues to the homeworks, succeses at
   science courses and the activities with their families. The age range of
   mothers were between 35-40 and two of children 9, 3 children 10 and 1 of
   the child was 14 years old. As a result, success of students;
   considering to vulnerabilities for completeing homeworks and the
   activities that they did with their families was high. The school
   performances of children showed that, five of them were succesful in
   science cources. In addition, five of six students are vulnerable to
   complete their homeworks and also prefer to do simple experiments
   implemented in to playing and games with their parents. This study
   revealed that, the children which their families attended to parenting
   education programme were succesful and interested in science courses,
   which contributes to their cognitive improvement.},

Abstract = {The study aims to investigate the knowledge of students as well as the
   relationship between attitudes and behaviour also based on gender
   towards the environmental issues. For this purpose, a survey study was
   conducted using a group of students who are the eighth grade students at
   a secondary school in the North Cyprus. This study was performed in the
   second half term in the 2016-2017 academic year. In the study, the
   research data was gathered with ``Environmental Knowledge Test{''},
   ``Environmental Attitude Scale{''} and ``Environmental Behaviour
   Scale{''} developed by Comert ( 2011). Furthermore, in the analysis of
   data, the descriptive statistics, independent t-test and correlation
   analysis were used. According to the results, the majority of the eighth
   grade students have misconceptions and a lack of knowledge about the
   environmental issues. Additionally, we concluded that environmental
   knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of participants have not a
   significant difference based on the gender. The results revealed that
   the environmental knowledge of students and environmental attitudes have
   a moderately positive relationship.},

Abstract = {The construction of an efficient and long-term higher education system
   is an important prerequisite and guarantee for the development of higher
   education in a country, which is conducive to laying a good intellectual
   foundation for the enhancement of national strength. However, in the
   face of the shortcomings of the construction of China's higher education
   system, most of the researches are limited to theoretical researches and
   many researches are one-sided with self-styled thinking, which lack open
   and inclusive ideas and practical proof to theory. In order to further
   analyze the bottleneck of China's higher education development, on the
   basis of analyzing the characteristics of Chinese and American higher
   education system, this paper analyzes the difference between Chinese and
   American higher education system by the method of comparative research
   and literature research, and adopts the multi-level fuzzy hierarchy
   comprehensive evaluation method to deal with the relevant data of
   Chinese and American higher education system. Then, it discusses and
   contrasts the macro-control function of the American government and the
   direct control function of the Chinese government, and then puts forward
   the aspects that China's higher education system should improve on the
   basis of fully considering China's national conditions. It also proposes
   that while enhancing the independence of educational evaluation, we
   should improve the Chinese law, change the government functions, and pay
   attention to the construction of higher education system theory research
   to build a pluralistic higher education system. Compared with other
   researches on the China's higher education development, this paper draws
   on the advantages of the American higher education system and puts
   forward the countermeasures and suggestions which are more suitable for
   the development of higher education system in China.},

Abstract = {This study is to verify the relationship between ownership structure and
   corporate performance, as well as the persistence of the relationship,
   by means of the relevant information of value creation provided by
   intellectual property. More than four thousand data of Taiwan listed
   companies during the period of 2002-2011 are analyzed in this research.
   Dynamic perspective is adopted to develop the persistence of the
   relationship between ownership structure and corporate performance.
   Regression results show that potentially non-linear relationship exists
   in the relationship between ownership and corporate performance.
   Evidence demonstrates that the impact of ownership on performance is a
   kind of corporate life cycle function, especially in the maturity stage
   as well as in the high-tech industry where it is particularly obvious.
   More importantly, the concept of intellectual property and the ownership
   mechanism of different industry attributes provide different information
   about value creation in different life cycle processes through dynamic
   design approach. For robustness, the measured variables of ownership are
   further lagged by a period to alleviate potential endogeneity issue.
   Overall, this study mainly contributes to extending the importance of
   corporate life cycle, and through this, more finely assessing the effect
   of ownership and the impact on corporate performance.},

Abstract = {Multimedia technology is a information technology which comprehensively
   processes and controls information in form of text, graph, image,
   automation and sound. With the development of multimedia information
   technology, network teaching has played a significant role in modern
   teaching owe to its characterizations such as digit-orientation,
   information-orientation, massive amount of information, high
   interactivity, and wide coverage. This technology has become an
   indispensable auxiliary teaching approach, promoting the deep reform of
   education. However, the development of network education function is
   still immature. Moreover, the major of art design is a unique major
   focusing on innovation thinking, cultivation of innovation
   consciousness, encouraging students to experience, explore and rethink.
   Therefore, the resources for art-design network teaching is
   insufficient. On this basis, it is of great significance to apply
   multimedia technology to art-design course teaching, give full play the
   advantage of multimedia courseware, and enhance the scientization,
   professionalization and individualization of art-design education. This
   paper first introduces the research background and current status, then
   discusses the design methods of network multimedia courseware. The
   designing and making of art-design network teaching courseware is a key
   point for the construction of network teaching environment. The study on
   network teaching courseware designing and making is a necessity for deep
   reform of art-design as well as an important approach for exploring new
   development direction of art-design teaching.},

Abstract = {In visual art education, researchers has to be aware that it is
   necessary to explore the position of an image, within the time period's
   cultural, sociological, technological conditions that effect the image,
   in order to achieve a full understanding of that very image or visual
   composition. In that sense, setting a sample study that mirrors ``how
   and under which effects a sign changes throughout time?{''} is worth
   investigating. The aim of this study is to explore the traces of
   symbolic existence of peripheral circumstances in a visual composition
   and as well as reflect that the composition is structured by these
   circumstances. In that sense, a brief review of the history of woman
   image has been chosen to set a sample study to search for the above
   mentioned dynamic. In order to trace the links in between meaning making
   and meaning reading processes, with the basic assumption that any sign's
   meaning differs according to its position among surrounding signs
   ``woman image{''} offers continuity of existence throughout history
   which constitutes the bases for a comparative research. Continuity, in
   comparative analysis of an image may constitute a solid base in order to
   increase the level of cognation of students in the field of visual arts.},

Abstract = {Our country has entered the aged society, the health education in the
   elderly is imminent. The studies in the effects of aerobic exercise mode
   on the cardiovascular system in the middle-aged and elderly people will
   provide theoretical basis and practice mode. Research methods: 30
   healthy people (aged 50-70) were selected to undertake 8-week exercise
   as the aerobic exercise model (45mins/day, 5times/week). Measured
   indexes such as cardiovascular functions, hemodynamics flow, blood fat
   and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAs) before and after the
   exercise, and then analyzed and compared them by mathematical
   statistics. Research result: 1) Cardiovascular function indexes pulse
   rate (PR), pulse pressure(PP), systolic pressure(SP), diastolic
   pressure(DP), valid pump effort(VPE) of left heart, heart oxygen
   consumption volume (HOV) decrease more or less, while cardiac
   output(CO), stroke volume(SV), stroke index(SI), cardiac index(CI) is
   obviously higher than before (p<0.01). 2) There is no significant
   difference in hemorrheology indexes like thrombus formation lime (TFL),
   microcirculation strees time (MST), and erythrocyte aggregation
   index(VAI), while blood viscosity (eta b), blood reduced viscosity (eta
   r), fibringen (PFC), plasma viscosity (eta p), hematocrit (Hct) drop
   apparently (p<0.05). 3) Blood-lipoid indexes cholesterol (Ch),
   triglyceride (Tg), low density lipoprotein (LDL) gets lower after the
   experiment, while high density lipoprotein (HDL) is higher (p<0.01). 4)
   Angiotensin I (Ang I) is obviously lower than that before the
   experiment, but angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone (Ald) has no
   significant differences. Research Conclusion: the aerobic exercise model
   of jogging plus broadcast gymnastics is beneficial for middle-aged and
   elderly people 1) improve their cardiovascular system function. 2)
   decrease the blood viscosity with a certain significance to prevent high
   blood viscosity syndrome (HVS) for them. 3) prevent the coronary
   atherosclerosis in them. 4) accelerate renal blood flow in them, reduce
   angiotensin I secretion, improve cardiovascular functions, strengthen
   cardiovascular compliance, prevent and reverse the risk of
   cardiovascular disease.},

Abstract = {The right to education is one of the most essential rights ensured by
   international agreements. The right of mother tongue education is vital
   for a child to have equal access to education and derive benefits from
   that education as do other children. The literature has claimed that
   receiving bilingual education offers many benefits, such as preserving
   cultural and ethnic identity and the linguistic knowledge of minority
   groups, and helps in socialization so that minority group members are
   involved in the community. Therefore, a need exists to develop a
   bilingual education program for the benefit of the academic development
   and social life of minority communities. The purpose of this study is to
   investigate a bilingual education curriculum scale including certain
   parameters such as the views and attitudes towards bilingual education
   and curriculum development that may affect the development of a
   bilingual education curriculum in Turkey. The results indicated that
   ``The Attitude Scale towards the Development of a Bilingual Education
   Curriculum (DBEC){''} is a valid and reliable tool. The DBEC is a valid
   and reliable data collection tool for future studies on attitudes
   towards a bilingual education curriculum.},

Abstract = {In face of the rapidly changing environment and unpredictability of
   tourist hotels as well as rising consumer needs, constant learning is
   necessary for tourist hotels to maintain the competitive advantage and
   survival. Continuous learning is therefore required for organizations
   and individuals in tourist hotels; however, the learning levels and
   types are distinct. To enhance the international competitiveness, a
   tourist hotel has to effectively absorb, transfer, and even create new
   knowledge for the effective innovation. For this reason,
   ``organizational learning{''} and ``knowledge creation{''} become the
   keys in the future research on innovation. Total 360 copies are
   distributed, and 304 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate
   84\%. The research results are concluded as below. 1) Organizational
   learning shows significantly positive correlations with knowledge
   creation. 2) Knowledge creation reveals remarkably positive correlations
   with organization innovation. 3) Organizational learning presents
   notably positive correlations with organization innovation. 4) Knowledge
   creation appears mediation on the relationship between organizational
   learning and organization innovation. Finally, suggestions, according to
   the research results, are proposed, expecting to enhance the market
   share and profitability of tourist hotels and to maintain the
   sustainable management and development.},

Abstract = {In this study, we demonstrate the use of conjoint behavioral
   consultation (CBC) as a main model to join parents and educators in the
   shared development and implementation of comprehensive interventions for
   students. A cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) model and schema-based
   instruction (SBI) served as an intervention and delivered in the context
   of CBC to enhance mathematical resilience. A multiple probe design
   across participants was used. The mothers and teachers of three boys
   between the ages of 10 and 11 years who were exhibiting performance
   deficits on the mathematics outcomes served as consultation
   participants. Direct observation data suggest that intervention
   implemented within the context of CBC was related to increases in
   mathematical resilience. In general positive changes were noted from
   pretreatment to post treatment administrations of the well-being
   questioner. Measures of treatment acceptability, treatment integrity,
   and social validity also yielded positive results. This study lends
   support to the use of CBC as a means of joining parents and teachers in
   the delivery of effective academic and behavioral interventions.},

Abstract = {In this study, undergraduate students were asked to construct fables
   which occurred in science laboratory. A fable is a type of story which
   mainly give moral lessons and put forward the principle of life.
   According to the directions, the students used ``rules in
   laboratory{''}, ``safety cautions{''}, ``laboratory materials{''} and
   ``first aid principles{''} in a correct manner. Research group were
   chosen from Department of Elementary School Education students.
   Students' fables were marked with rubrics developed by the researchers.
   In the marking process, general qualifications of fables and basic
   principles of science laboratory were questioned in a correct manner.
   Data was examined by using ``code and theme list{''} to ``content
   analysis technique{''}. As a result, fables presented and information
   about their true values were focused on. This study is thought to make
   contributions in terms of the original contributions for researchers and
   teachers who are seeking innovations in science education and laboratory
   techniques in terms of the application.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine university students' perceptions
   concerning the concepts of ``water{''} and ``water pollution{''} by
   means of metaphors. The study group was composed of 258 undergraduate
   students attending Hacettepe and Gazi Universities in the 2015-2016
   academic year. A semi-structured questionnaire containing the statement
   ``water/water pollution is like.......because......{''} was administered
   to the participants. The technique of content analysis was employed in
   analysing the data, for which the MAXQDA 12 software programme was used.
   Results showed that the students perceived the concept of water as a
   need and an indispensable part of life, while they perceived the concept
   of water pollution as the end of life.},

Abstract = {Applications of Internet in various fields have become modern demands.
   How to make full use of the resources of colleges and universities to
   improve the health of the whole people has become a research topic under
   the premise of national fitness rise as national strategy. In this
   paper, starting from development mode of Internet plus, combining with
   actual status of Chinese college physical education development, under
   the circumstance of international internet era, by virtue of the role of
   Internet plus, reform and develop-ment of Chinese schools' physical
   education have been analyzed and summarized, and development strategies
   thereof have been concluded with document literature, logistic analysis,
   interviewing methods and the alike. Through mutual interactive and
   distribu-tive research on internet and college physical education
   resources, promotion has been made to better combine school physical
   education and public fitness to bring the role of internet in college
   physical education resources into full play. Research showed that
   in-ternet plus technology could explore college physical education
   resources in a proper manner to make resources sharing available;
   current college education resources have been fully utilized and
   effectively distributed in a reasonable way by carrying out internal and
   external distribution on college physical education resources internal
   via internet.},

Abstract = {Focusing on multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) regarding
   classroom teaching quality evaluation, this article aims to devise a
   novel evaluation framework based on heterogeneous linguistic
   information. In this framework, a four-level evaluation process of
   classroom teaching quality is established. Then, the weights of the
   sub-attributes are estimated objectively by integrating a newly proposed
   score function of interval linguistic 2-tuples and optimization models
   which consider the realistic situation that alternatives are not equally
   weighted. Subsequently, the exploitation process is implemented by two
   branches: taking the possibility measurement to rank teachers with
   respect to different attributes and extending the technique for order
   preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to assess the
   overall performance of teachers. Finally, a simulated case is furnished
   to illustrate how to apply the presented framework to realistic
   classroom teaching quality evaluation problems. Hopefully, this work
   would be beneficial to the improvement of classroom teaching quality.},

Abstract = {One of the approaches for obtaining the satisfaction data for ABET
   ``Student Outcomes{''} (SOs) is to transform Course Learning Outcomes
   (CLOs) satisfaction data obtained through assessment of CLOs to SO
   satisfaction data. Considering the fuzzy nature of metrics of CLOs and
   SOs, a Fuzzy Logic algorithm has been proposed to extract SO
   satisfaction data from the CLO satisfaction data for any given course.
   The membership functions for the fuzzy variables namely CLOs, SOs and
   CLO-SO relationship have been defined with an implementable procedure to
   suit the problem. A set of 24 rules form the rule base of the fuzzy
   logic algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented and tested in
   MATLAB. An application example of a real-world problem has been
   presented.},

Abstract = {In first part, the models, theories, mechanisms and presumptions, as
   well as the ideas of educational choice' discourse have been
   scrutinized. In the second part, the survey on educational choice at
   Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Lithuania has been presented.
   The methodology used in this research is a survey of respondents and
   survey interpretation. The goal of questionnaire is to identify the main
   trends in the choice of studies at a technical university. An additional
   goal is to identify which educational choice theory reflects in the best
   way students' real decisions when choosing a specific study program. The
   survey shows that the following study programmes are enough feminine:
   ``Environmental Protection Engineering{''}, ``Bioengineering{''} and
   ``Biomechanics{''}. Nearly 80 per cent of students in those programs are
   females. ``Electronics Engineering{''}, ``Information Systems
   Engineering{''} and ``Transport Engineering{''} tends to be fully
   masculine (90-100 per cent of students are males). A technical
   university deals with such masculine subjects as technology,
   engineering, and mathematics usually have been mostly chosen by the
   mails. Choosing a study programme, the decision depends on the social
   class of a young man (woman). We can speak also about such factors of
   educational choice as the social, the cultural, and the creative
   capitals.},

Abstract = {Health communication and behavior intervention are main measures adopted
   in health education. Behavior intervention among these measures is the
   direct one to effect individual and group behaviors. Patients demand
   more than health information communication, but rely on health
   intervention service and related products. This essay starts from
   vertical extension of service industrial chain. And attribute health
   intervention products with characters of newsboy and random demand to
   outsourcing, the third party health management company (3PH). In
   addition, we establish mathematical model to describe how health
   intervention product ordering managed by 3PH and characterized with
   newsboy characteristic, makes impact on strategy and performance
   efficiency of 3PH. We obtain result of the optimal order quantity,
   optimal selling price and condition fulfilled optimal proportion of loss
   sharing, which is able to achieve added value on health education
   industrial chain.},

Title = {The Status of Science and Technology Relative to Other School Subjects.
   Results of a Study Conducted on Primary and Secondary School Students in

Abstract = {In recent decades, many studies have examined students' interest in
   science and technology (S\&T) at school. However, few investigations
   have studied this interest in a manner that accounts for the status that
   students assign to this subject relative to other subjects in the
   curriculum. The main objective of this article is to conduct such an
   examination. To assess this issue, three dimensions have been
   considered: ease, relative preference, and relative importance. This
   study, which included 2,571 students, reveals that S\&T occupies an
   intermediate position relative to other subjects, with only slight
   differences between boys and girls. However, there are important
   differences across school years: 1) S\&T is perceived to be increasingly
   difficult as students' progress in their schooling; 2) relative
   preference for S\&T decreases during the primary-secondary school
   transition but subsequently rises; and 3) the relative importance of
   S\&T increases compared with all other subjects as students advance in
   their education. Significant correlations are observed between the
   latter two dimensions and students' intentions to pursue studies or
   careers in S\&T.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to explore the relationships between pre-school
   educators' conceptions of and approaches to learning by web-searching
   through Internet Selfefficacy. Based on data from 242 pre-school
   educators who had prior experience of participating in web-searching in
   Taiwan for path analyses, it was found in this study that conceptions of
   learning by web-searching play a major role in approaches to learning
   without Internet Self-efficacy (ISE). The results indicated that
   preschool educators' Internet self-efficacy was the significant
   moderator of their conceptions of and approaches to learning by web
   searching. Thus, this result suggests that improving preschool
   educators' ability to use the Internet as well as their use of relevant
   web-based tools may increase their approaches to learning by
   web-searching, which may in turn strengthen their learning performances
   in Internet-based environments.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the relationship between the generation
   mechanism of miners' unsafe behavior tendency and conflict management
   strategies, including cooperative conflict management strategy,
   competitive conflict management strategy and avoidant conflict
   management strategy. Miners from 3 collieries in Shanxi province
   completed a questionnaire, from which a valid sample of 148 responses
   was selected. Structural equation modeling analysis using the AMOS 7.0
   was employed to test the hypothesized model relating the above-mentioned
   variables. The conclusion shows that the model was supported, and
   conflict management strategies have a significant impact on the
   generation mechanism of miners' unsafe behavior tendency. Insecurity
   psychology acts as an intermediary role between the three conflict
   management strategies and coal miners' unsafe behavior tendency.
   Interpersonal intimacy acts partly as a regulating role between the
   three conflict management strategies and insecurity psychology.
   Practical implications of these results for the control of miners'
   unsafe behavior tendency are discussed.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with innovative teaching methods at universities. The
   result of this effort is the interactive P\&E method, whose main idea is
   the interactive work with students while solving problem tasks. The main
   aim of the given method is to change the students' position, by means of
   experiment analyses and qualitative tasks, from a passive to an active
   one. The aim of our continual research is the comparison of the study
   results reached in the teaching process using interactive methods with
   the study results reached in traditional teaching process. During the
   study the students took the pre-test and the post-test. From the results
   of the didactic test is possible to conclude that the use of interactive
   methods improves the students' results in these tests. The worst results
   are achieved, in the long term, in the tasks aimed at the specific and
   non-specific transfer.},

Abstract = {This study aims to examine options to increase the supportive power of
   parents, teachers, school administrators, and counselors who directly
   interact with children and adolescents and have a fundamental
   responsibility to protect them from the risks of substance abuse and
   evaluate the effectiveness of associated training programs. The study
   design is a cross-section survey with a total sample 45,807 participants
   (13,973 primary and secondary school teachers, 601 school
   administrators, 429 counselors, and 30,804 parents). For each group,
   specialized educational programs were prepared according to the assumed
   information needs and implemented accordingly. At the end of the
   implementation, each group was asked to evaluate the degree to which
   they benefitted from their own program. When the sample group responses
   pertaining to the education they received, it was found that in general
   when the overall education was examined, no responses fell below 90\%
   where 99.58\% found the educational programs ``very beneficial{''} and
   90.43\% found the educational programs ``beneficial{''}.},

Abstract = {Student satisfaction is a primary indicator for college and university
   organizational self-assessment in European and American countries.
   Professional sport universities are the major institution cultivating
   sports talents in China. Nevertheless, it appears the problem in past
   years that the talent cultivation and management is not suitable for the
   development of society and sports in China. Such a problem could be
   solved from various dimensions. From the aspect of management, the
   reinforcement of self-assessment is practicable. Aiming at such a
   problem, the professional sport university student satisfaction
   evaluation scale is constructed for developing the self-assessment of
   professional sport universities in China. The students in a professional
   sport university in China are taken as the respondents of survey in this
   study. Total 2715 students are surveyed, including 796 females and 1919
   males. The questionnaire is tested three times in the design process.
   First, the pre-survey for the initial scale is preceded. Second,
   Threshold Analysis, Item-Total Correlation, and Exploratory Factor
   Analysis (EFA) are applied to classify the scale and construct the
   professional sport university student satisfaction scale, covering 6
   dimensions and 58 questions. Third, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)
   is utilized for analyzing the collected data. The development and
   application of satisfaction scale develop a practicable tool of
   self-assessment for professional sport universities as well as assist in
   promoting the teaching service quality of universities in China and
   enhancing the continual improvement.},

Abstract = {Effective medical and biomedical engineering education is an important
   problem. Traditional methods are difficult and costly. That is why
   Virtual Reality is often used for that purpose. Educational medical VR
   is a well-developed IT field, with many available hardware and software
   solutions. Current solutions are prepared without methodological
   approach. As a result, each VR system used for medical purposes is
   unique - there is no standardization, which leads to increased
   development time and costs. The paper presents an original methodology
   that can be used for building immersive virtual reality (VR)
   applications dedicated to training medical skills. The methodology is
   named ``knowledgeoriented medical virtual reality{''} (KOMVR), as it
   uses basic knowledge-engineering tools during processes of planning,
   building and verification of interactive educational solutions. The
   paper shows successive stages of the methodology and the tools used for
   its execution. Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated
   with a simple example - a human body atlas. Major time reduction can be
   achieved while using the methodology - time reduction in the presented
   case was from 50 to 14 working days. The proposed innovative approach
   can increase effectiveness of preparation of educational VR solutions in
   medicine, but also in other branches of engineering.},

Abstract = {Teachers are actively encouraged to plan their lessons such that there
   is maximum classroom talk, namely accountability talk. However, many
   lessons do not display sufficient accountability talk. This study
   attempted to better understand the level and quality of accountability
   talk in six science lessons. The study aimed to provide teachers with
   insight into the level and quality of accountability talk during the
   lessons. Video recording was used to record the lessons. Videotapes were
   transcribed for analysis. An accountability talk rubric was used to
   measure the extent to which the classroom talk was accountable to
   learning community, accurate knowledge, and rigorous thinking. The
   results showed high levels of talk associated with accountability to
   accurate knowledge compared to accountability to rigorous thinking and
   accountability to learning community.},

Abstract = {As is well known, bridging teacher knowledge or learning with practice
   is not a straightforward task. This paper aims to explore this
   discrepancy between a mathematics teacher's knowing and practices and to
   offer ways of alignment between the two based on the
   social/interpersonal meanings and their realization through teacher's
   discourse. In this study, we utilized discourse analysis of
   interpersonal meanings within a high school mathematics class mainly by
   focusing on the mathematics teacher's discourse. We have found that an
   interpersonal meaning manifested by teacher's discourse establishes
   counterproductive social roles and relationships for the
   knowing/learning to come alive. We conclude that the realization of
   interpersonal meanings can hinder or support the generation of ideas
   within the classroom: both for teacher's knowing and student's
   mathematical meaning making.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyse prospective chemistry teachers' cognitive
   structure related to the subject of covalent and ionic bonding.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants in order
   to determine their cognitive structure, and the interviews were audio
   recorded to prevent the loss of data. The data were transcribed and
   transferred into the computer medium. Furthermore, a flow map was
   prepared for each prospective chemistry teacher and then was analysed
   firstly in terms of quantitative variables used in presenting cognitive
   structure in quantitative statements. Secondly, the statements in the
   flow maps were analysed in terms of comprehension level. In consequence,
   it was found through flow maps that prospective chemistry teachers were
   not very different from each other in terms of cognitive structure and
   that their cognitive structures were full of inadequacies and
   misconceptions. Having analysed the statements in the flow maps in terms
   of the levels of comprehension, the scope and richness of prospective
   chemistry teachers' cognitive structures were exhibited in more details.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to try to investigate the spatial-temporal
   reasoning states of primary school children between the ages 8 and 11
   who play an instrument, regarding mathematics lessons from the teachers'
   views. This current study is both qualitative and quantitative in
   nature. In other words, the mixed research method was used in the study.
   Regarding the teachers' views, the memories of these students in
   mathematics and music lessons were found to be ``excellent{''}. Also,
   their effective use of numbers and visual intelligence in music lessons
   was found to be ``excellent{''}. As a result, it was seen that there was
   a significant but weak correlation between the spatial-temporal
   reasoning states of children who played an instrument, regarding the
   mathematics lesson, and the abilities of playing an instrument.},

Abstract = {This article presents results of a case study of a math circle designed
   for low income, minority students from an inner city middle school. The
   students were 6th, 7th and 8th grade African American and Hispanic males
   enrolled in a science, technology, engineering and mathematics focused
   charter school. The study focused on the impact of participation in the
   math circle on students and the design features of the experience that
   were most effective at promoting engagement and positive reactions from
   students. Participating students reported increases in their interests
   in mathematics, their confidence in their ability to tackle mathematics
   problems, and in their enjoyment of mathematics. Competitions and
   affirmation by a mathematician were key motivating factors for students.
   Implications for the design of math circles that promote positive
   mathematical identifies among marginalized populations of students are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This study aims to discuss the correlations among learning styles,
   meaningful learning, and learning achievement. Directed at the rather
   difficult to comprehend human blood circulation unit in the biology
   materials for junior high school students, a Mobile Meaningful Blood
   Circulation Learning System, called MMBCLS gamification learning, was
   developed. In the study, the instructional design is based on meaningful
   learning and follows the principles of digital game-based learning
   models to design after-class multimedia materials, which allow learners
   to enjoy learning. With a quasi-experimental design, Kolb's learning
   styles scale and meaningful learning scale were utilized as research
   instruments. Taking a G8 class as the subject, 46 valid questionnaires
   were returned. The research findings show divergences in mobile
   game-based learning styles: students with convergent styles highly
   regarded the well-designed curriculum in meaningful learning; student
   gender presented no significant difference in curriculum design and
   learning achievement in meaningful learning; students with different
   learning styles revealed remarkable differences in learning achievement;
   and students in the experimental group apparently had a higher learning
   achievement than the students in the control group, with notable
   differences. The research outcomes could be cited by teachers for
   designing material and provide educators with a reference for the mobile
   as meaningful media material design..},

Abstract = {Over 50 years, two major reform efforts in science education took place.
   The purpose of the present study is to explore how the educational
   reforms were reflected in nine 6th grade science textbooks published in
   1975, in 1985 and in 1997 in terms of (a) the materials used, (b) the
   contexts to which the electricity concept was related, (c) the type of
   student activities, and (d) the domain of learning objectives dealing
   with text activities. For the analysis, a checklist was developed. Our
   findings show that the concept of teaching electricity has moved from
   transmitting a body of knowledge and the discipline of science
   orientation to a more social learning and a student centered pedagogical
   orientation.},

Abstract = {The demand for distance education has been increasing at a rapid pace
   all around the world. This, in turn, places a special importance on the
   need for the development of more distance education systems. However,
   there is an alarming rise in the number of distance education students
   that drop out of the system without asking for any help. The present
   study focuses on forming three fuzzy-based models through K-Means,
   C-Means and subtractive clustering. The models are designed to predict
   students' year-end academic performance based on the 8-week data kept in
   the learning management system (LMS). Next, the models are evaluated in
   terms of their accuracy in order to determine the most suitable one.
   Then, the data was analyzed through various statistical methods and the
   results were compared. The model provides invaluable information
   regarding the students' year-end success or failure by analyzing the
   data on Basic Computer Skills, a course included in the curriculum for
   sophomores at a local university. Thanks to such information, those who
   are likely to drop out can be determined and accordingly, the
   institution can start to take measures to encourage students not to drop
   out early in the semester, which, in turn, can increase the extent to
   which distance education can be successful. The present study will
   hopefully decrease the number of students that drop out of distance
   education systems.},

   learning to teach scientific inquiry using a practical approach affected
   teacher's attitudes, evaluations of use of inquiry and their actual
   design of inquiry based instruction. The methodology included the use an
   approach incorporating inquiry methodology combined with a
   technology-infused and engineering rich approach called ``Intelligent
   Robotics{''} to help teachers learn and use a new approach to teaching
   scientific inquiry. The findings showed that these teachers
   progressively moved from more teacher-centered thinking about teaching
   to student-centered thinking and actions incorporating scientific
   inquiry. They also worked together in designing an interdisciplinary
   inquiry curriculum, providing an effective alternative to traditional
   rigid standards based curriculum and teacher directed instruction.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine thesis studies on
   technology-supported mathematics education in Turkey in terms of the
   keywords, mathematical areas, technologies and methodology used and
   results obtained. Data were obtained from 105 graduate theses. At the
   end of the analysis of the data, it was determined that most used
   keywords were from the subject area of mathematics education and there
   were more studies that focused on algebra in comparison with those on
   geometry, and the computer was the most frequently preferred technology
   employed. Researchers mostly preferred to take primary education 6th,
   7th, 8th grade students as their population samples, and used
   achievement tests as the data collection instrument. It was found that
   mixed research methods were the most frequently employed ones,
   quantitative studies were preferred more than qualitative studies,
   mean/standard deviation data were used more in the analysis of
   quantitative data while descriptive analysis was preferred more in the
   analysis of qualitative data. When the results obtained from
   experimental studies in the theses were compared, it was seen that
   higher values were obtained in treatment groups receiving
   technology-supported education in terms of achievement, attitude towards
   mathematics, interest in mathematics, motivation for mathematics and
   retention of learning.},

Abstract = {This study compared students' perceptions of doing science and
   scientists reflected in their drawings using a modified version of the
   Drawing-A-Scientist-Test across five different countries: China, India,
   South Korea, Turkey, and US. The participants were 1,800 students from
   grades three, seven and ten from the five countries. Thirty students
   randomly selected were interviewed using a semi-structured interview
   protocol. Results indicated that fewer stereotypes were exhibited at the
   lower grades than at the higher grades in all of the countries. Students
   from India, US, and South Korea perceived doing science passive more
   than those from Turkey and China. A larger number of Indian and Turkish
   students reported that they wanted to become a scientist or have a
   science related career compared to those from the other countries. In
   addition, students' perceptions of scientist were not related to their
   career choices in any country. However, students who perceived science
   as active practice were inclined to choose science-related career more
   than students who regarded science as passive practice in Korea and US.
   There was no statistically significant difference by perception of doing
   science actively or passively for career choice in India, Turkey and
   China.},

Abstract = {The number of students completing mathematics education at higher levels
   are in decreasing numbers, despite good grades at primary level. This
   research study sought to explore the mathematics learning trajectory by
   collecting Mathematics grades obtained by 1652 students at the end of
   primary and secondary schooling. Data analysis showed a moderate
   association between these grades. But those who performed well at the
   primary level did not necessarily study the subject at the same learning
   performance at higher levels. This research study unveiled that girls,
   in general, tend to maintain their learning performance better than boys
   at higher levels. It also revealed that some students experienced a
   positive turning point in their learning, and the overarching
   conclusions from students' interviews included perceived usefulness of
   Mathematics education, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to boost the
   learning process and the need to overcome past hurdles. Finally, a model
   was developed to monitor learning progress achievement.},

   and aimed to analyze the relationship among intellectual property
   rights, open innovation, and organizational performance of 30 New
   Technology Based Firms (NTBFs). Senior managers, middle managers, and
   business owners were considered as appropriate respondents for study. A
   total of 140 questionnaires were distributed among the respondents, and
   126 filled questionnaires were returned. The research method used in
   this study is descriptive-correlation and the analysis was carried out
   utilizing Structural Equation Modeling. The factors analysis and the
   findings show that intellectual property rights have a significant
   positive relationship with open innovation. Further, open innovation has
   a significant positive relationship with organizational performance.
   Moreover, no significant relationship between intellectual property
   rights and organizational performance was established. But, intellectual
   property rights affect organizational performance positively, through
   open innovation acting as a mediator.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine the extent of
   undergraduate students' use of Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) for personal and educational purposes, and (2) to
   examine differences in their use based on their gender, academic year,
   major, ICT access, and perceived ICT competencies. A descriptive method
   was followed in which 252 participants completed a questionnaire. The
   participants were students from a university in Jordan. The results
   showed that almost all the students owned smartphones and majority of
   them owned laptop computers. They had easy access to common types of
   technologies such as computers and the internet. They had moderate
   competencies in the general use of these common technologies, and high
   competencies in using smartphones. They were users of common digital
   tools and applications for personal purposes. Their ownership, access,
   competencies with, and use of ICT for personal purposes did not result
   in extensive use of ICT for educational purposes. However, students' use
   of ICT for informal learning had multifaceted relationships with their
   use of ICT for personal purposes, ICT access, and ICT perceived
   competencies. Students' ICT use for informal purposes is also influenced
   by their gender. However, the students' use ICT for formal learning was
   not directly influenced by their ICT access, ICT perceived competencies,
   gender, or major. But, students' use ICT for formal learning was related
   to their use of ICT for personal purposes and for informal learning.
   Nowadays university students surrounded by technology, some common types
   of these technologies include smartphones, Social Networking Service
   (SNS), computers, and the internet. They know how to use these types of
   technologies. Students' use of ICT in their learning is directly and
   indirectly influenced by several factors. University administrators and
   faculty members should take advantage of students' use and experience of
   specific types of ICT such as smartphones and SNS in their personal and
   social life by formally integrating such ICT in students' learning.
   However such integration needs careful planning in terms of considering
   the pedagogy related to technology integration and considering the
   factors that would influence students' acceptance and use of such
   technologies.},

Abstract = {This study intends to discuss the effects of university PE teachers'
   leadership styles and classroom climate on learning motivation for
   basketball course. University students in Guangdong Province, as the
   research objects, are surveyed with PE teacher leadership style scale,
   learning motivation for physical education scale, and classroom climate
   in physical education scale. Total 589 valid copies of questionnaire are
   analyzed with Multiple Stepwise Regression Analysis. The research
   results show that teacher support, affinity, charismatic leadership, and
   intellectual stimulation could positively predict intrinsic motivation,
   teacher support, laissez-faire leadership, and individualized leadership
   could positively predict identified regulation, charismatic leadership,
   individualized leadership, and involvement could positively predict
   introjected regulation, and laissez-faire leadership and passive
   management by exception could positively predict motivation.
   Accordingly, PE teachers' leadership styles of individualized
   leadership, charismatic leadership, and intellectual stimulation as well
   as classroom climate of teacher support, affinity, and involvement could
   positively affect students' autonomous motivation, while laissez-faire
   leadership and passive management by exception could positively affect
   students' non-autonomous motivation.},

Abstract = {In current conditions, higher educational institutions have to develop
   innovative mechanisms of education quality assurance independently. One
   such mechanism is the implementation of the European Foundation for
   Quality Management (EFQM) model, although the 9001:2001 International
   Organization for Standardization (ISO) model is widely implemented in
   the higher education system of Kazakhstan. International Organization
   for Standardization (ISO) model is widely implemented in the higher
   education system of Kazakhstan. In- depth theoretical and methodological
   studies developed a design technology for a quality assurance system.
   The purpose of this study is to confirm the validity of this technology,
   which is why the study sets the following tasks: 1) to determine the
   validity criteria for the developed technology; 2) to show that the
   developed technology meets the validity criteria. An important result of
   this study is that it substantiated the criteria of the selected types
   of technology validity: construct, criterion, and content. The study
   proved that the developed technology met the criteria of validity, which
   was the main result. This allows recommending higher educational
   institution in Kazakhstan to implement this technology.},

Abstract = {This study carries out a bibliometric retrospective of the journal
   Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education
   (EJMSTE) between 2012 and 2017 by using the bibliometric analysis and
   visualizing approaches. A series of bibliometric indicators, such as
   H-Classics publications, major prolific authors, institutions and
   countries and research themes etc., were included. With the help of 655
   structured data retrieved from the Web of Science, we found a rapid
   growth trend of published productions. The most prolific authors,
   institutions and countries (territories) are mainly from Turkey and
   Taiwan, and this indicates this journal was dominated by these two
   countries (territories). Analysis of research themes showed science
   education, teacher education, mathematics education, attitude/attitudes
   research, problem solving and professional development were the main
   research themes for this journal. The citation impact analysis of
   research theme showed that three themes (i.e., student teacher,
   Technology Acceptance Model and animals) attracted more citations than
   others. Six clusters were identified which formed the main knowledge
   base of this journal. Analysis of cited and citing journals presented
   the knowledge commutation status of EJMSTE between other journals. These
   findings will help the readers to get a quick and intuitive overview and
   may be useful for helping the possible authors in deciding if their
   papers should be submitted to EJMSTE.},

Abstract = {The relevance of the research: For the fourth decade, Russian education
   system has undergone constant changes at various levels: from preschool
   to higher education. Accordingly, the process of teacher's professional
   training is being modernized, including state educational standards,
   which assume significant strengthening of the role of practical
   training. In this regard, it becomes urgent to find a balance between
   the theoretical and practical training of the future mathematics
   teacher. The purpose of the study is to identify the optimal balance
   between theoretical and practical teaching in the process of
   professional training of the future mathematics teacher. The research
   was carried out based on the regularities of the methodological problems
   of pedagogical forecasting, including the expert evaluation method,
   historical analysis, practical methods (questionnaire surveying).},

Abstract = {This study tried to explore what motivates international students to
   attain PhD graduation requirements in mathematics and sciences studies
   in a Chinese research university. The design of the study was
   qualitative and all collected data were analyzed by thematic analysis.
   The study explored the motive forces that enable international PhD
   students to persist and solve all challenging situations to fulfill PhD
   graduation requirements in mathematics and sciences studies. The
   internal and external motivations were found to be the main cause of
   their persistence to continue their studies until they meet their
   graduation requirements. International PhD students in mathematics and
   sciences reported to be challenged by the communication barriers, unfit
   social interaction, advanced software to be used and different high
   requirements to be attained in a research university. The discussions of
   findings considered other existing related studies and theories that
   help people to persist and achieve their desired goals and targets.
   Possible solutions to existing challenges and further research' areas
   were suggested in this study.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out with the aim of developing the Attitude Scale
   towards Crisis and Chaos Management of Higher Education Administrators.
   Firstly, literature search was carried out in the development process of
   the scale. Then, 10 open-ended questions were asked to 10 Higher
   Education administrators about crisis and chaos management. By using the
   obtained data and expert opinions, a 58-point item pool was created.
   Expert opinions were consulted to ensure content validity. Corrections
   were made in line with the opinions and recommendations of the experts.
   Five items similar to each other that were not attitude item were
   removed from the scale. After the corrections made, the item pool was
   reduced to 53 items. The items created are of the five-point likert type
   and evaluted as I certainly do not agree (1), I do not agree (2),
   indecisive (3), I agree (4), I strongly agree (5). Pilot scheme was
   conducted with a total of 305 higher education administrators and
   academicians working at Ankara, Gazi, Baskent, and Hacettepe
   universities in spring semester 2016-2017. The KMO value of the scale
   was found to be 0,696. As a result of the factor analysis, it was
   determined that the 25 scale items were collected in 3 factors and the
   total variance of scale was 78.587\%. 25 items with an item load higher
   than.40 were included to the scale. Loads of the items in the final
   scale consisting of 3 factors and 25 items are between.42 and.80. The
   Cronbach Alpha coefficient of the final scale was calculated as 0.87 and
   found to be highly reliable. The results of item analysis based on
   averages of the upper and lower groups of all the items in the scale
   were found to be significantly distinctive (p <. 05). It is thought that
   this research will contribute to higher education administrators and
   academicians and researches to be done in the field of crisis and chaos
   management.},

Abstract = {In postmodern education philosophy, the areas of interest of students,
   student-oriented teaching and regulating learning-teaching environments
   according to the student are essential. Based on this viewpoint, the
   purpose of this research is to evaluate the student-related factors in
   terms of Cyprus history. The aim is to determine the attitudes of
   students towards Cyprus history (in the case of local-oral history) and
   to explore the student-related problems from the perspective of teachers
   in particular. In the study, the attitude levels of students are
   determined and the problems experienced in Cyprus history are described;
   furthermore, this is followed by a discussion on postmodern education
   and local-oral history education. Postmodern education in the case of
   Cyprus history is evaluated. In this context, the problem sentence of
   the research is as follows: ``What are the student and teacher opinions
   in regard to local and oral Cyprus history education on the basis of
   postmodern education?{''} The model of this study is a mixed research
   method, which is based on both quantitative and qualitative data.
   Stratified random sampling was used in this study and a total of 800
   secondary and high school students from five different districts of
   Cyprus were reached.},

Abstract = {In recent years, China's coal mine safety accidents are frequently.
   Human factors are the main cause of coal mine safety accidents, and
   miners' unsafe behavior is one of the main forms of human factors. It is
   necessary to conduct in-depth study on the unsafe behavior of miners to
   ensure the safety of coal mine. In this study, the relationship between
   coal miners' subjective well-being and unsafe behavior was examined from
   the perspective of ordinary miners' well-being. And then the influencing
   factors of miners' unsafe behavior were analyzed. Two hundred miners
   were selected randomly for this study in Datong Coal Mine Group of
   Shanxi Province. Then, a questionnaire was completed by the 200 miners
   respectively, and a valid sample of 184 responses was collected.
   SPSS23.0 software was used to organize and analyze these data. The
   conclusions show that the hypotheses were all confirmed, and subjective
   well-being has a significant impact on miners' unsafe behavior, positive
   emotion has a negative influence on miners' unsafe behavior, negative
   emotion has a significant positive impact on miners' unsafe behavior,
   and life satisfaction has a significant negative relationship with
   miners' unsafe behavior. Thus, some countermeasures were put forward for
   coal mine managers to enhance miners' subjective well- being and reduce
   their unsafe behaviors.},

Abstract = {Since the reform and opening-up, China's education has been developing
   rapidly but facing many systematic problems. In the background of
   developing mixed ownership system actively, developing the mixed
   ownership system in educational field has significant realistic value in
   broadening the source of the educational funds, de-administration in
   educational field, introducing normative competition mechanism, breaking
   through the restriction of the public schools' establishment and
   stimulating vitality of running a school. This paper uses the public
   theory to analyze the present status of development of mixed ownership
   in educational field and the problems of all kind of education, and
   discovery the development path of mixed ownership system, including
   classifying reform, improving relevant laws and regulations, breaking
   through the ideological fetter of all-or-none thinking, clearing
   ownership of property, clarifying the responsibility of each party,
   strengthening the pilot work and finally realizing the reunification of
   particularity and universality.},

Abstract = {With the advent of the era of knowledge economy, skills training,
   knowledge acquirement and management are increasingly combined with
   business management practices. There is preliminary evidence show that
   the education, learning and management of accounting knowledge have a
   significant correlation with the enterprise performance. Based on the
   theory of accounting education and knowledge management, this paper
   investigates the influence of internal control on the performance of
   working capital management from the perspective of internal control
   acquisition, direct learning and indirect learning. The empirical study
   on China's capital market shows that with the improvement of accounting
   education and knowledge management, the quality of internal control of
   enterprises will also be improved, furthermore, the performance of
   working capital management will be obviously improved. The conclusion of
   this paper not only enriches the literature in the field of accounting
   education and knowledge management, but also provides the crucial
   evidence that how Chinese enterprise can improve the rationality and
   scientificity of working capital management decision.},

Abstract = {The cultivation of student loyalty is an important topic in higher
   education reform, while the theoretical modeling and evidence for the
   effect of teachers' interaction styles on student loyalty are seldom
   discussed. Based on Social Exchange Theory, Theory of Empathy, and the
   effect of power on pro-social behavior, 359 science \& technology
   management master students in China are sampled in this study. With
   Hierarchical Regression Analysis, the conclusions are summarized as
   following. Interaction-and task-oriented interaction shows positive
   correlations with student loyalty, self-oriented interaction presents
   negative correlations with student loyalty, satisfaction reveals
   mediation on the relationship between the three interaction styles and
   student loyalty, and the mediation of satisfaction on the relationship
   between interaction- and task-oriented interaction and student loyalty
   is moderated by science \& technology management master students'
   management level. This study expands the theoretical framework of
   perceived interaction and student loyalty and provides decision-making
   reference for higher education service institutions cultivating student
   loyalty.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of education on
   the mathematical achievement, problem-solving skills and the views of
   students on the 5E instructional model and the mathematical modelling
   method for the ``Geometric Objects{''} unit. The students were randomly
   selected from the 8th grade of a secondary school in Northern Cyprus.
   One group was the experimental group to which the 5E instructional model
   applied, and mathematical modelling was applied to the other. As a data
   collection tool, the ``Geometrical Objects Multiple Choice Achievement
   Test{''} was applied to the experimental groups. As a result of
   statistical analysis, it was seen that the teaching provided by the 5E
   Instructional Model in Experimental group 1 and the Mathematical
   Modelling Method in the Experimental group 2 increased the academic
   achievement of the students; however, the mathematical modelling method
   was more successful in the mathematical achievement and problem-solving
   skills of the students.},

Abstract = {According to the swift development of education system, Taiwanese
   government is always devoting diminishing the educational divide between
   rural and urban regions. This research focuses on this educational
   divide by cross-employing the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) of
   quantitative analysis and the Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis
   (fsQCA) of qualitative analysis in order to reinforce research
   reliability, validity and representativeness. These analysis method are
   used to assess the results of questionnaires given to professors',
   senior industrialists' and senior professionals' experts. Two valuable
   conclusions are comprehensively induced from the evaluated results: (1)
   the autocorrelationships between the digital characteristics of Online
   Learning Courses (OLCs) and the level of rural-urban Education Divide
   (ED) are completely testified through the correlationships evaluations
   of the educational features Mediators that directly and powerfully
   resupply the educational research myth and gap and (2) Connectionization
   of Course Operation (C-CO) of the digital characteristics of Online
   Learning Courses (OLCs) is positive to effectively enhance the
   educational features of the students' basic learning abilities (SBLA)
   and the educationinstitution learning capabilities (EILC) that
   empirically provide the most beneficial niche strategy to minimize the
   rural-urban Education Divide (ED).},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of game-brand congruity and flow in
   racing advergames to explore the influence of embedded brands. Data from
   a pre- and post-test experiment were collected from total 200 of college
   students. They played the racing advergames between two measures. The
   results revealed that game-brand congruity and flow impacted brand
   personality in games. The embedded brands that were congruent with the
   content of the game negatively influenced brand personality, whereas the
   embedded brands that were incongruent with the content of the game
   positively influenced brand personality. Gamers who exhibited high flow
   in the advergame gave positive feedback on brand personality; gamers who
   exhibited low flow in the advergame gave negative feedback on brand
   personality.},

Abstract = {In the modern society when intelligent mobile devices become popular,
   the Internet breaks through the restrictions on time and space and
   becomes a ubiquitous learning tool. Designing teaching activity for
   digital learning and flexibly applying technology tools are the key
   issues for current information technology integrated education. In this
   study, students are tested and proceeded questionnaire survey to
   understand the opinions about digital learning. To effectively achieve
   the research objectives and test the research hypotheses,
   quasi-experimental research is applied in this study. Total 116 students
   in 4 classes are selected as the research subjects for the instructional
   research. The research results conclude that 1. digital learning
   presents better positive effects on learning motivation than traditional
   teaching does, 2. digital learning shows better positive effects on
   learning outcome than traditional teaching does, 3. learning motivation
   reveals significantly positive effects on learning effect in learning
   outcome, and 4. learning motivation appears remarkably positive effects
   on learning gain in learning outcome. It is expected to combine with
   current teaching trend and utilize the advantages of digital learning to
   develop practicable teaching strategies for the teaching effectiveness.},

Abstract = {How to enhance students' reading comprehension as well as reading
   interest is a currently serious problem for elementary school students.
   Students can learn various knowledge through reading, as a result of
   this reason, the advantage and disadvantage of reading ability could
   directly affect the learning efficiency. This study proposes networked
   peer support strategy which is different from previous networked peer
   assessment strategy. It adopts the method to ask students' to give one
   another positive feedback during the activity. It can also reduce
   competitive pressure among students and enhance interaction willingness
   and learning fun, and then increase the degree and depth of reading
   reflection. The results show that using networked peer support strategy
   is much better than using networked peer assessment strategy in
   improving reading comprehension. Further, students who get
   medium-achievement in the pre-test and belong to site-dependent
   cognitive style and executive thinking style all have significant
   improvements in reading comprehension.},

Abstract = {Self-efficacy toward science learning has been shown to play a crucial
   role in determining students' motivation and achievements. Social
   cognitive theory proposes that positive and negative task outcomes
   affect mastery experiences from which self-efficacy develops. The
   current research examined whether prior level of self-efficacy would
   serve as a moderator of the effect of experiential valence on
   self-efficacy in science learning. One hundred and thirty engineering
   undergraduates with varying levels of prior self-efficacy (high, medium,
   and low) were randomly assigned to receive either a positive or a
   negative task experience regarding circuit design. The findings of our
   experiment showed that students with lower levels of self-efficacy
   appeared to be more affected by positive versus negative task
   experiences, and those with higher levels of self-efficacy tended to be
   more affected by negative versus positive task experiences. The present
   findings indicate that both valence of task experience and students'
   prior self-efficacy affect their changes in self-efficacy with regard to
   STEM learning. The present findings have far-reaching implications for
   enhancing self-efficacy on learning of science.},

Abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) is recognized as one of the most important
   developments in educational technology for both higher and K-12
   education as emphasized in Horizon report (Johnson et al., 2016, 2015).
   Furthermore, AR is expected to achieve widespread adoption that will
   take two to three years in higher education and four to five years in
   K-12 education (Johnson et al., 2016, 2012). If this is the current
   state of the art for the use of AR in education, it is important to
   investigate how educators and researchers integrate AR into
   teaching-learning processes. Looking from such a glimpse, the purpose of
   this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant
   research regarding the emergence of augmented reality, the links to
   pedagogy and educational outcomes, specifically in the context of formal
   education. The scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework
   Arksey and O'Malley (2005). First, research questions are identified.
   Second, the last five years in ERIC database is explored by using the
   search term `augmented reality.' Third, studies are investigated through
   inclusion and exclusion criteria, and PRISMA (2009) model is utilized
   for article selection. Fourth, selected articles are charted with
   respect to numerous dimensions and summaries. Finally, findings are
   reported in the light of research questions. The findings of the scoping
   review illustrated a set of studies that provide evidence of improved
   academic performance, increase in students' engagement, motivation, and
   satisfaction through the educational environments that are enriched with
   AR applications. The findings of the scoping review are discussed with
   respect to multiple dimensions that are explored under research
   questions.},

Abstract = {The touch mouse is a new type of computer mouse that provides users with
   a new way of touch-based environment to interact with computers. For
   more than a decade, user experience (UX) has grown into a core concept
   of human-computer interaction (HCI), describing a user's perceptions and
   responses that result from the use of a product in a particular usage
   context. This paper presents an empirical study of UX on touch mice via
   the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) survey, the purpose of which is
   to uncover how target users perceive the selected touch mice after
   interacting with them. A total of 20 university students were recruited
   as target users to participate in the UX test to perform defined tasks
   with the 6 selected touch mice under the Windows 8 operating
   environment. The experimental results can help researchers understand
   how users perceive and value such new type of computer mouse, thus
   ensuring positive UX and leading to more desirable touch mice.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the perceptions of
   pre-service mathematics teachers related to drama-based instruction. For
   this purpose, effects of a drama-based mathematics course on senior
   class pre-service mathematics teachers' knowledge about drama-based
   instruction and teacher candidates' competencies for developing and
   implementing drama-based lesson plans were investigated. Participants of
   the study were 21 senior class pre-service mathematics teachers of a
   public university in Turkey. Data were collected through an open-ended
   evaluation form, lesson plans and self-assessment reports. After the
   11-week implementation of drama-based activities with teacher
   candidates, pre-service mathematics teachers succeeded to develop unique
   lesson plans and implement them with pupils. Lesson plans and
   self-assessment reports of teacher candidates were analyzed according to
   descriptive and content analysis. Findings were discussed according to
   the emergent categories.},

Abstract = {Along with the constant advance of information technology and the rapid
   development of the Internet, the diverse functions and characteristics
   of e-learning break through lots of limitations in traditional
   instruction. Properly integrating e-learning design with Internet
   activities could enhance students' learning effect, and applying digital
   technology to assist in teachers' instruction is a future trend of
   instruction. A nonequivalent experimental design is applied to the
   quasi-experimental research in this study, in which total 162 students
   in three classes in National Taipei University of Technology, Tung Fang
   Design Institute, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology
   in Taiwan are selected as the research subjects for the 16-week (three
   hours per week) experimental teaching research. The research results
   conclude that 1. thinking styles present significant effects on transfer
   of learning, 2. e-learning shows remarkable effects on transfer of
   learning, 3. liberal thinking styles reveal the best effect on promoting
   far transfer under e-learning, and 4. conservative thinking styles
   appear the best effect on promoting near transfer under e-learning. At
   the end, conclusions and suggestions are proposed in this study,
   expecting to provide teachers with some assistance in the teaching
   methods.},

Abstract = {This study examines the pre-service teachers' opinions about conceptual
   integration (CI) and their understanding of it. A qualitative
   phenomenology design was used in the study. Data was collected through
   in-depth semi-structured interviews comprising ten guiding questions.
   Three pre-service physics and three pre-service chemistry teachers
   participated conveniently in the study. While the pre-service chemistry
   teachers took a course regarding the CI explicitly taught, the
   pre-service physics teachers were not subjected to any information
   relating to the CI in their course. Data was analyzed by forming the
   codes and themes. Generally speaking, while the pre-service chemistry
   teachers think that physics concepts should be used in the chemistry
   lessons, the preservice physics teachers believe that these two
   subjects' concepts generally are not related to each other. Moreover,
   the participants had some difficulties in understanding the CI between
   physics and chemistry concepts. The possible implication for science
   teacher education and research is discussed.},

Title = {The Effects of Concept Map-Oriented Gesture-Based Teaching System on

Abstract = {Gesture-based learning have particularities, because learners interact
   in the learning process through the actual way, just like they interact
   in the nondigital world. It also can support kinesthetic pedagogical
   practices to benefit learners with strong bodily-kinesthetic
   intelligence. But without proper assistance or guidance, learners'
   learning performance are usually disappointing. To cope with this
   problem, the aim of this paper proposed a concept map-oriented
   gesture-based teaching system in earth science course. There were 90
   participants in the experiments designed with the three teaching
   strategies (concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system,
   conventional gesture-based teaching system, and traditional e-book
   teaching materials). The experimental results show that the concept
   map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book
   teaching materials also improve the learning performance of the students
   in earth science course than conventional gesture-based teaching
   strategy. Learners' cognitive load was also measured and showed that the
   concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy had lower cognitive
   load than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. There was no
   significant difference in learning performance and cognitive load
   between the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and
   traditional e-book teaching materials.},

Abstract = {The Science Teachers' Pedagogical Discontentment (STPD) scale has
   formerly been developed in the United States and used since 2006. Based
   on the perceptions of selected teachers, the scale is deeply rooted in
   the cultural and national standards. Given these limitations, the
   measurement integrity of its scores has not yet been conclusively
   established internationally, such as in the Saudi Arabia context. The
   items of the scale are slightly tailored to make the instrument suitable
   in the specific context, such as with respect to country-based
   regulations, reforms, and everyday practices of science teachers and
   their professional development initiatives. Item-based descriptive
   statistics, the measure's factor structure as opposed to its former
   validity studies, and factor-based reliability scores are investigated
   in the present report. Thus, this study extends the validity and
   reliability measures of the instrument to the international scale and
   further confirms its appropriateness to measure teacher attitudes
   towards inquiry-based science education initiatives.},

Abstract = {This study explored 5-6 year-old children's conceptual understanding of
   one geometric shape, the triangle. It focused on whether children could
   draw a triangle from memory, and identify triangles of different types,
   sizes, and orientations. The data were collected from 82 children
   attending state preschool programs through a one-on-one interview,
   during which children completed five paper-pencil tasks. Findings showed
   that the majority of the children (93\%-96\%) successfully identified a
   prototyped triangle. Approximately half of the children experienced
   difficulties in identifying triangles of different sizes, types, and
   orientations. The most difficult area was identifying types of
   triangles, where an isosceles triangle and a right triangle were
   presented, followed by identifying triangles in different orientations,
   specifically flipped and rotated ones. Children appeared to identify and
   classify the triangle relying on the visual prototype. These findings
   provide support for the Prototyped Theory, van Hiele theory, and for
   works by Clement and colleagues.},

Abstract = {In this study, smartphone was used to alter the traditional procedure by
   involving students in active learning experiences prior to the
   laboratory meeting. The researcher surveyed students' view on the effect
   of using smartphone to enhance learning in the general physics
   laboratory. The use of smartphone was evaluated by having 120 students
   who enrolled in the Fall Semester 2013 at a Chinese university general
   physics laboratory fill out subjective opinion survey forms. Results
   showed smartphone was a very useful tool to provide background on the
   lab safety information, administrative requirements, general knowledge
   of physics lab equipment, but not very useful to show how to write a
   laboratory report. This was because the laboratory report evaluation was
   according to the individual instructor's specific preferences.
   Interestingly, it was also found male students prefer smartphone
   learning strategy more than female students, although no significance
   was presented.},

Abstract = {Using multiple representations of a problem can reveal the relationship
   between complex concepts by expressing the same mathematical condition
   differently and can contribute to the meaningful learning of
   mathematical concepts. The purpose of this study is to assess the
   performances of mathematics teacher-candidates on trigonometry problems
   represented in different formats and to examine the reasons for test
   failures. This study uses a mixed-method approach and consists of 51
   teacher-candidates enrolled in the Department of Mathematics Education
   at a state university. The data collection tools were a symbolic
   trigonometry test, a visual trigonometry test, and a verbal trigonometry
   test. Interviews were conducted with the teacher-candidates to reveal
   the reasons of their failures and the advantages and disadvantages of
   each representation style for the trigonometry problems. This study
   found that the teacher-candidates were most successful on the symbolic
   test and least successful on the verbal test. The teacher-candidates
   stated that seeing different representation forms helped them to
   understand the questions better and produce multiple solutions.},

   in science were negatively predicted by beliefs in inborn learning
   ability (ILA) and requirement for time in learning (RTL), while
   understandings about tentativeness was positively predicted by the same
   belief factors. Also, understandings of characteristics of scientific
   knowledge were positively predicted by beliefs in ILA and RTL, and
   hierarchy between laws and theories were negatively predicted by beliefs
   in ILA, RTL and development of learning ability with opportunity and

Abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate how history of mathematics was
   integrated to some mathematics textbooks in Turkey. On this account,
   four different textbooks with different grade levels were chosen. In
   total, 42 cases were detected and studied by three researchers. Results
   indicated that the usage of history of mathematics was materialized in
   six different manners: giving mathematics a human face, showing how
   concepts have developed, developing a multicultural approach, explaining
   the roles of mathematics in society, changing the perceptions of
   mathematics and providing opportunities for investigation. Among these
   manners, it is observed that giving mathematics a human face is the most
   frequent manner, while the least apparent one is providing opportunities
   for investigation.},

Abstract = {This study is based on the generative learning model which involves
   context-based learning. Using the generative learning model, we taught
   the topic of Halogens. This topic is covered in the grade 10 chemistry
   curriculum using activities which are designed in accordance with the
   generative learning model supported by context-based learning. The
   purpose of this study was to ascertain the effects of the activities on
   students. motivation towards context-based chemistry learning, their
   attitudes towards chemistry lessons and their level of success in
   understanding the halogen concepts that were taught. The sample of the
   study consisted of 60 grade 10 students in a high school in Ankara,
   Turkey. The study was conducted using a pretest - posttest design with a
   control group of 30 students and a treatment group of 30 students. The
   Context-Based Chemistry Motivation Scale, the Attitudes towards

Abstract = {After the collapse of the former Soviet Union, many Central and Eastern
   European countries underwent significant change in their political and
   educational systems, among them Georgia and Moldova. Reforms in
   education sought to overcome the highly centralized educational system
   of the former Soviet Union as well as to conquer the teacher-centred
   paradigm in schools that was both dominant in these countries during
   pre- and post-Soviet times. National reforms demanded more
   student-active and problem-based science education under the heading of
   hands-on and inquiry-based learning. Unfortunately, in many cases, the
   curricula, teaching materials, and teacher training facilities were
   inadequate in implementing these reforms successfully. In the case of
   science education, this paper reflects upon how European Union (EU)
   initiatives can help the countries in Central and Eastern Europe in
   their reform efforts. Reflection is performed in relation to the
   cross-regional TEMPUS IV project SALiS (Student Active Learning in
   Science). SALiS envisages countries strengthening their capacities to
   promote contemporary science education through investments in science
   teacher education curricula and infrastructure. The current paper
   discusses the potential of such EU projects for aiding reform in science
   education in EU-neighbouring countries.},

Abstract = {There are changes in the education system in Georgia. The National
   Educational Reform has started several years ago. The present study
   evaluates Georgian science teachers' and science student teachers'
   beliefs about teaching and learning. To draw a broad view about their
   beliefs, qualitative and quantitative instruments have been used.
   Generally, the assumption is that both groups mainly hold traditional
   beliefs about teaching and learning. However, the study reveals that
   differences between teachers and student teachers are noticeable. While
   student teachers are strong traditional in their beliefs, science
   teachers show tendencies toward modern beliefs. The results are
   discussed and the recommendation for the further development of science
   teacher education in Georgia is given.},

   Alienation Scale{''} developed by Mottaz (1981), The ``Five Factor
   Personality Features Scale{''} developed by John et al (1991), were also
   used. These are applied to the nurses which form the sample of the
   research. In the evaluation of the data; frequency analysis, correlation
   analysis, structural regression and path analysis were used. In the
   neurotic personality of personality traits of nurses had an influence on
   dimension of meaninglessness of work alienation and five other
   personality traits were found to have no significant effect on work
   alienation.},

Abstract = {In this study, five industrial senior designers are invited to observe
   and record a required design practice course of an industrial design
   department of a university for one semester, 18 weeks, each week for 5-6
   hours. During the process, the imagination indicators proposed by
   Vygotsky is adopted in combination with a 5-point Likert scale. The
   sophomore class, 63 students in total, is observed. The outcome of study
   indicates that when the topics are with limitation, the gender factor
   has significant influence during design stages, and the influence of
   students' pre-university learning background is significant as well.
   When the topics are not limited, the influence of the gender factor also
   appears to be significant. The pre-university learning background has
   more influence on the performance of imagination and vocational high
   school graduates do better than regular high school graduates. In the
   meantime, students with higher level of class participation exhibit
   better imagination.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore instructional design experiment
   regarding the different performances and influential factors of
   reflection and assessment on creating creative and imaginative works.
   This research adopted the quasi-experimental research method with
   non-equivalent pretest-posttest designs. The 218 college students as
   samples were randomly assigned into the experimental groups and control
   groups. The Questionnaire of Creative Thinking (QCT) and Works Analysis
   Form (WAF) were conducted as assessments in this research. The
   conclusions of the findings are as followings: 1. the students'
   performances of creating creative and imaginative works were better
   after receiving the creative instructional design of Lotus Blossom
   Technique (LBT). 2. more excellent imaginative works can be produced, if
   the students can be provided with specific creating steps. The college
   students' creativity performances can be promoted with offerings of
   creativity courses and methodology by the qualified college teachers
   with instructional design.},

Title = {Assessing Science Motivation for College Students: Validation of the
   Science Motivation Questionnaire II using the Rasch-Andrich Rating Scale
   Model},
Journal = {EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Motivation in science learning is believed to be essential for students'
   pursuit of college-level studies and lifelong interest in science. Yet,
   the trend of low levels of motivation in learning science continued in
   college can be linked to a national concern about low scientific
   literacy levels and science career aspirations. To diagnose the current
   status of motivation of college students, it is important to have an
   instrument that can assess students' motivation. The purpose of the
   present study is to examine the level of motivation of college students
   and establish the validity and reliability of a motivation
   questionnaire-the Science Motivation Questionnaire II (SMQ II) developed
   by Glynn et al. (2011)-using the Rasch-Andrich rating scale model. The
   original instrument consists of 25 items allocated in five sub-factors.
   Both person separation reliability and item separation reliability were
   excellent. The item separation index indicated good variability of the
   items and the five rating scale functioned well. All Infit and Outfit
   measures in the Rasch analysis demonstrated a lack of unidimensionality
   of the science motivation construct in the SMQ II, which supports the
   deletion of two items to satisfy the unidimensional structure.},

Abstract = {Since the ancient times, there have been the cultural tradition of
   valuing knowledge more than its practical usage. With the development of
   social economy and the requirement of modernization construction, the
   talent quality required by enterprises is becoming higher and higher,
   which makes the structural contradiction of higher education become more
   and more prominent. The training mechanism which is adopted by colleges
   and universities for training applied, compound and innovative talents
   cannot meet the needs of industrial updating, and the employment
   problems of graduates are salient. This paper uses questionnaire survey
   method and literature review method, conducting research to 500 college
   students and 200 college teachers on four dimensions include whether the
   teachers are suitable for the requirements of the majors, the proportion
   between the theoretical learning and the practical training, the
   evaluation indicators of school assignments and the education mode of
   the cooperation between school and enterprise. The study found that the
   practical education colleges and universities has begun to diversify and
   marketize, but there are still gaps between teacher resources of
   practical education in colleges and universities and newly professional
   docking; practical education has overcorrection problem with valuing
   practical usage more than knowledge learning; the evaluation system of
   higher practical education needs to be perfected. Based on this
   situation, we can explore the development path of higher education,
   first is to open to market and create diversified resource platform;
   second is to strengthen the construction of teacher group and forge
   teaching practice team; Third is to establish a reasonable curriculum
   system and pay attention to effectiveness; Fourth is to reform the
   evaluation form; Fifth is to build up diversified and open class mode.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of technology from day to day has manifested
   itself also in the field of education, and therefore it has become
   compulsory to include new regulations in education. In this fast-paced
   development, technology is coming into prominence both in distance
   education and traditional education. In this context, the technological
   organization established has an important role in the emergence of
   success perception. Since computer has begun to be used in the field of
   education, in addition to traditional education, the distance education
   has become in a more effective and productive education for foreign
   language learners. In this study, the distance learning, traditional
   education, teaching environments and perception of organizing as
   academic achievement are explained. The study has been carried out in a
   private university in the academic year of 2016-2017. The aim of this
   study is to evaluate the perception of success between distance
   education and traditional education in the foreign language education.
   This study examined the perceptions of administrators, lecturers and
   students towards the distance learning and traditional learning in order
   to evaluate the academic success of organizing in foreign language
   learning. The qualitative data analysis was used in this study.
   Administrators and students reported that they were prepared to
   facilitate individual study and improve their work skills with distance
   learning in the foreign language learning, but that the lecturers were
   not in the same position with the administrators and students in
   distance education.},

Abstract = {Based on the theory of principal-agent theory, this paper makes an
   empirical study on the process of influencing the performance of
   enterprises by using the analysis method of
   ``power-decision-performance{''} analysis, using hierarchical regression
   and group regression analysis to analyze the diversification strategy of
   entrepreneurial enterprises analysis. The results show that the
   ownership concentration of entrepreneurial enterprises has a positive
   impact on the financial performance of entrepreneurial enterprises and
   has a negative impact on the market performance of entrepreneurial
   enterprises. The increase of ownership concentration will inhibit the
   diversified development tendency of entrepreneurial enterprises, and the
   related diversification strategy which has a positive effect on the
   financial performance and market performance of the enterprise. The
   related diversification strategy has some mediating effect in the
   process of the impact of ownership concentration on the performance of
   the firm, and the negative report of the media has a negative adjustment
   in this process.},

Abstract = {A decade has elapsed since the Learning Management System (LMS)
   technology permeated its way into higher education in Sub-Saharan Africa
   (SSA), offering new paradigms of both blended and online mode e-learning
   delivery. Parallel to other continents, the introduction of LMS
   stimulated acceptance and adoption intentions among stakeholders in
   higher education. This necessitated research into faculty members' and
   students' LMS acceptance and adoption intentions. While some research
   has been conducted in this dimension, the evidential facts are
   scattered. There is a need to agglomerate these studies to project a
   better picture of study patterns and results, to be abreast of the
   current state of the literature and better direct future research. This
   study sought to bridge the gap by way of a systematic review of previous
   studies within a decade of LMS acceptance research in SSA, placing them
   in contextual paradigms of models, methodologies, milestones, subjects,
   countries, findings and challenges. Results from a systematic review of
   31 studies, revealed key determinants of LMS acceptance/adoption to be
   Attitude and Perceived Usefulness; followed by Performance Expectancy
   and Perceived Ease of Use; then lastly Social Influence. Major
   challenges to LMS implementation identified were ICT infrastructure; LMS
   usage skills and training; LMS system quality, LMS use policy and
   management support. TAM1 was the dominant model employed and students
   were the main subject of studies. Moreover, quantitative approach was
   the preferred design with Regression as the main statistical tool used
   for data analysis. The study recommended among others that more UTAUT or
   TAM3 based studies employing mixed method design with instructors as
   subjects, using structural equation modelling analysis are needed in SSA
   LMS research. Leadership and top management of higher education
   institutions should focus more on ICT infrastructure, LMS usage
   skills/training, LMS quality related issues, support and ICT policy
   formulation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the effect of attachment styles on
   perfectionism in romantic relationships among university students. 136
   university students participated in this study. The data collection
   tools were ``Perfectionism in Romantic Relationships Scale{''} and
   ``Relationships Scale{''}. The ANOVA analysis system was used to define
   the differences, if any, in points related to the participants' and
   their partners' gender, birth-sequence, the state of their
   relationships, and attachment. A correlation analysis to with age was
   carried out to determine differences, if any, to do with age and a
   t-test analysis was used to determine differences, if any, to do with
   gender. The findings showed that there was no difference in terms of
   gender in both perfectionism type scores. In addition, while there were
   no differences in self-perfectionism scores according to their
   birth-sequence, there are reasonable differences when romantic
   relationships are at stake. A posthoc study showed that these
   differences are seen among the participants with no past experience, but
   have newly started a relationship. When points related to a partner's
   perfectionism is considered, it is seen that there are no differences to
   do with birth-sequence and romantic relationships. A negative
   correlation, at a reasonable level, has been seen between age and
   partner-oriented perfectionism. Finally, there seemed no differences
   between self-perfectionism and partner's perfectionism points in
   attachment styles.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, we have entered a new era of globalization and information.
   The new information technology featured by Internet and computer has
   permeated every sphere of our lives and affected our viewpoint of
   consuming and life-style. As for translation teaching, the traditional
   translation-teaching model cannot satisfy the needs of modern education.
   In China, the translation teaching based on Internet has become the
   norm. And more and more people have accepted the mobile learning model.
   Under such background, this study analyzes the features of mobile
   teaching and constructs a new model of mobile interactive translation
   teaching from the perspective of constructivism. The paper also
   preliminarily testified the new model by taking three different social
   interactive tools that are most popular in China as example, that is,
   WeChat, QQ, and Micro-blog. The result shows that this new model based
   on ``Internet +{''} can improve translation teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {The emergence and development of new media has a great influence on
   people's life, study, thought and mental health, especially the
   psychological impact on contemporary university students. The rapid
   development of the network brings not only new opportunities to the
   university students' mental health education, but also a severe
   challenge to the traditional methods and content of the work. In order
   to improve the negative influence of the new media, in this paper, the
   development of new media is taken as the starting point, and combined
   with the characteristics of psychological development of contemporary
   young university students, the double influence of new media development
   on the development of university students' mental health is expounded.
   Then, the data analysis is used to verify the results, and corresponding
   solving measures are proposed, to promote ``one to many{''} mode of
   education, even more to achieve the education development model of
   ``many to many{''}, realizing effective utilization and reasonable
   allocation of resources. At the same time, to create a virtual
   educational exchanges network environment makes the young university
   students forgetting the identity barriers between teachers and students,
   which is more conducive to the students in the process of psychological
   counseling, improves the timeliness and pertinence of mental health
   education of university students.},

Abstract = {This paper selects 69 coal mine rescue accidents from 1981 to 2011 in
   China, focusing on direct unsafe acts and high-frequency unsafe acts
   that lead to coal mine rescue accidents. Two conclusions can be drawn.
   The first conclusion is that there are five categories of direct unsafe
   acts that cause coal mine rescue accidents: not wearing respirators as
   required, not following the gas detection requirements, the poor
   abilities of the ambulance crew, technical measures not in place, and
   the violation of commanding. The first two has a larger proportion, as
   their sum is 57.97\%, more than half. The second conclusion is that out
   of all relevant unsafe acts, nineteen categories of high-frequency
   unsafe acts are statistically significant, and 5 types are well-marked
   due to their higher frequency: not wearing respirators when rescuing,
   talking through respirator in the underground rescue process, not
   testing underground gas composition dynamically, not carrying a spare
   respirator, no pro-examination of the equipment. The analysis results
   can be used to educate employees and students.},

Abstract = {The performance excellence model provides a framework for the
   implementation of total quality management in Colleges and universities,
   based on the practice of entrepreneurship education in China's colleges
   and universities, this paper uses the excellent performance management
   model to conduct an empirical analysis of the quality of
   entrepreneurship education, and gets the following conclusions: First,
   the driving wheel of entrepreneurship education consists of three
   dimensions: the leadership support of entrepreneurship education,
   entrepreneurship education strategy and market orientation, the driven
   wheel of entrepreneurship education includes entrepreneurship education
   resource allocation, the process of entrepreneurship education, the
   measurement and improvement of entrepreneurship education. Second, in
   the driving wheel, the leadership support of entrepreneurship education,
   entrepreneurship education market orientation have a positive effect on
   soft quality and hard quality of entrepreneurship education; the
   entrepreneurship education strategy only has a positive effect on the
   soft quality of entrepreneurship education, but on the hard quality is
   not verified. Third, in the driven wheel, entrepreneurship education
   resource allocation and the process have a positive effect on soft
   quality and hard quality of entrepreneurship education; the measurement
   and improvement of entrepreneurship education has positive effect on the
   hard quality of entrepreneurship education, but to the soft quality has
   not been verified.},

Title = {Who says Organic Chemistry is Difficult? Exploring Perspectives and
   Perceptions},
Journal = {EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Much research has identified organic chemistry as an area of difficulty
   for learners. There is also much literature pertaining to the factors
   that contribute to learners' difficulties. This paper explores the
   intersections of teachers' and learners' perceptions of teaching and
   learning organic chemistry respectively. Understanding these nuances has
   implications for all involved in the teaching and learning of organic
   chemistry. Teachers' understanding of their learners' perspectives has a
   critical influence on developing meaningful learning. This paper reports
   the perceptions of those teaching and learning organic chemistry at high
   school and university level. Surveys were used to gather data from four
   cohorts of participants. These included high school students (n=276) and
   teachers (n=79) from 73 high schools as well as university students
   (n=121) and lecturers (n=20) from 12 different universities in Ireland.
   While many of the learner participants enjoyed organic chemistry and
   found it interesting, the majority found it difficult to learn and
   understand. The learners' attitudes to organic chemistry was compared
   with their actual level of understanding. This comparison revealed some
   disparity. The teachers showed a relatively accurate perception of their
   learners' experience of organic chemistry. While there was broad
   agreement between the teachers' and learners' perceptions of organic
   chemistry, the discrepancies are explored to inform future teaching and
   learning. There were different reasons why teachers and learners
   identified topics as easy or difficult to teach or learn respectively.
   This paper provides a novel contribution to existing literature by
   investigating teachers' and learners' perspectives. There is evidence to
   suggest that these participants are not aware of the multitude of
   complex factors impacting their experiences. The participants' views are
   largely-dominated by external factors in the educational contexts. While
   these factors are significant, it is important also that teachers and
   learners become more aware of the intrinsic factors. In any case,
   educational change is a slow process, and tangible change can only
   happen within individual classrooms if driven by individual teachers and
   learners. Many of the extrinsic factors are beyond the control of
   teachers and learners. However, addressing some of the intrinsic factors
   is within the capabilities of teachers and learners who are willing to
   share and develop together. The critical role of teacher's empathy and
   other factors are identified and addressed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Put forward four mathematical models of learning efficiency: exam review
   model, talent cultivation model, career development model and quality
   education model. Exam review model points out those students of common
   capacity and quality are likely to get higher score. Talent cultivation
   model points out that the students very talented in some respects may
   not get ideal exam result. Career development model gives two elements
   which decide a personal career achievement: learning rate and learning
   time. Quality education model describes the expectation of future talent
   types, and provides a tentative idea of quality education.},

Abstract = {This is a quasi-experimental study with a non-equivalent group pre-test
   and post-test designed to investigate the effects of learning with
   smartphone video recordings in fundamental nursing practice. General
   `intramuscular injection' practice for sophomore nursing students was
   given to the experimental and control groups for two weeks. The effects
   of the learners' self-evaluation, fundamental nursing practice
   competency evaluation, self-efficacy, and learning satisfaction were
   measured and analyzed using an independent t-test, paired-sample t-test,
   and ANCOVA. The results indicated that the smartphone video recording
   practice method, which was applied to nursing students, had significant
   positive effects on the improvement of fundamental nursing practice
   competency and learning satisfaction. Therefore, the smartphone video
   recording method for learning fundamental nursing skills can be
   considered effective for improving students' learning and satisfaction
   in the self-directed learning context.},

Abstract = {China is one of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Chinese
   students' awareness and understanding about global warming have a
   significant impact on the future of mankind. This study, as an initial
   research of this kind in Mainland China, uses clinical interviews to
   survey 37 grade eight students on their understanding about global
   warming, as well as their personal actions to combat it. Findings show
   that students know CO2 and acknowledge the existence of global warming,
   but 94.6\% of them have not formed scientific conceptual understanding
   or the ability to make scientific decisions to combat it. The study also
   shows that mass media, rather than science education, serves as the main
   source for students to obtain information about global warming. These
   results implicate that the concept of global warming must be added in
   science education and the teaching quality of scientific concepts must
   be promoted in Mainland China.},

   Learning (TL) in academic performance of students in higher education in
   two groups of the first course of Computer Science Degree at the
   university. The empirical study was conducted through an analysis of
   covariance (ANCOVA) in order to assess whether teaching methods have a
   significant effect on academic performance. The results show that
   teaching methods did not have a significant effect on the academic
   performance of the students. However, informal interviews with students
   revealed that they preferred CL. The study also explores whether there
   was a relationship between the average scores for conceptual and
   problem-type questions between both groups through a t-test analysis and
   for both courses there was no significant difference in the exam results
   between the two groups. Students who were exposed to TL methods
   outperformed the students who were taught via CL in mid-term exam.
   However, the result is opposite in the final exam where students from CL
   obtained better scores. Finally, with CL techniques students got better
   global results because they acquired a depper understanding of the
   materia.},

Abstract = {One challenge for an optimal design of the mathematical components in
   engineering education curricula is to understand how the procedural and
   conceptual dimensions of mathematical work can be matched with different
   demands and contexts from the education and practice of engineers. The
   focus in this paper is on how engineering students respond to the
   conceptual-procedural distinction, comparing performance and confidence
   between second and fourth year groups of students in their answers to a
   questionnaire comprising conceptually and procedurally focused
   mathematics problems. We also compare these students' conceptions on the
   role of conceptual and procedural mathematics problems within and
   outside their mathematics studies. Our data suggest that when
   mathematical knowledge is being recontextualised to engineering subjects
   or engineering design, a conceptual approach to mathematics is more
   essential than a procedural approach; working within the mathematical
   domain, however, the procedural aspects of mathematics are as essential
   as the conceptual aspects.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine the drug-use habits in North
   Cyprus and to prepare a demographic study of drug wastage. A total of
   450 questionnaires containing 36 questions were handed out in 5 major
   cities of North Cyprus. Participants' pharmaceutical consumption habits
   and basic knowledge on rational use were compared with respect to their
   education level and living cities. People in Cyprus are using leftover
   medications in case of a need of 63.1\%. Most of the participants get
   their medication with prescriptions (43.5\%) and also pay attention to
   expiry dates while purchasing (80.6\%). The main reason behind the
   leftover medication is the end of the illness or treatment. The
   second-highest leftover group is antibiotics (17.5\%). According to the
   comparison of data between education levels and cities, rational drug
   use is statistically low for lower education levels (P = 0.002) and the
   Guzelyurt region (P = 0.002).},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the impacts of information and
   communication technology (ICT) use on students' math and science
   achievements, with a special focus on examining the trends of these
   relationships over the past decade. Data from all five waves of the
   Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) from 2000 to 2012
   were used. Three-level hierarchical linear modelling revealed that
   school-level ICT-related variables had positive influences on learning
   outcomes when national GDP, school type, and school ICT investment, were
   controlled for. However, the findings indicated that the relationships
   between different types of ICT use with math and science achievement
   were negative in the long term when students' families' social economic
   status was held constant. In addition, self-confidence in Internet tasks
   was discovered to be beneficial to both math and science, and thus,
   suggestions were made to develop students' confidence in conducting
   ICT-related activities.},

Abstract = {Recent studies on professional development programs indicate these
   programs, when sustained, have a positive impact on student achievement;
   however, many of these studies have failed to use longitudinal data. The
   purpose of this study is to understand the how one particular
   instructional practice (STEM PBL) used consistently influence student
   achievement. Three urban high schools in the southwest U.S. were
   assigned to participate in a professional development program for STEM
   teachers. Data for 565 students from these schools were collected at
   grade 8, 10, and 11. According to instructional practice observation
   tool, School 1 had a high level of STEM PBL implementation, school 2
   showed an average level of STEM PBL implementation, and school 3 had
   almost no STEM PBL implementation. Results indicated students' success
   for school 1 was significantly different than students' success for
   schools 2 and 3. Results also indicated no difference in student data
   for ethnicity in school 1.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on how prospective teachers learn about students'
   mathematical thinking when (i) anticipating secondary students' answers
   reflecting different characteristics of understanding and (ii) propose
   new activities in relation to the classification of quadrilaterals. The
   data were collected from forty-eight prospective secondary school
   teachers enrolled in an initial training programme. The results indicate
   three changes in how the prospective teachers anticipate secondary
   students' answers in relation to the role given to a perceptual or
   relational perspective of the classification of quadrilaterals. These
   changes are described considering how prospective teachers grasp the
   students' understanding of the inclusive relation among quadrilaterals
   as a conceptual advance. We argue that prospective teachers' learning
   was promoted after participating in a structured environment where they
   had the opportunity to discuss how to recognize the features of
   student's understanding.},

Abstract = {This study investigated how engineering integrated science (EIS)
   curricula affect first-year technical high school students' attitudes
   toward science and perceptions of engineering. The effect of the EIS
   participation period on students' attitudes toward science was also
   investigated via experimental study design. Two engineering integrated
   science curricula were purposefully designed and implemented for the
   study. Two important results emerged: (1) The EIS curriculum
   participation period (10 or 18 weeks) mattered in terms of changing
   students' attitudes toward science and (2) A majority (>61\%) of the
   students from both control and experimental groups who participated in
   the first EIS agreed that the curriculum positively affected their
   understanding of engineering practice. The results suggest that EIS is a
   potential pedagogical approach for reforming current science practice in
   technical high school programs to improve both students' interest in
   science and career readiness. Implications for implementing EIS in
   technical high school settings are addressed.},

Abstract = {The use of simulation technologies in learning has received considerable
   attention in recent years, but few studies to date have focused on
   vehicle driving simulation systems. In this study, a vehicle driving
   simulation system was developed to support novice drivers in practicing
   their skills. Specifically, the vehicle driving simulation system was
   designed according to various driving environmental factors that may be
   encountered while traveling, including roads, time, weather, ambient
   scenery, traffic flow, and vehicle of the driver. Moreover, to improve
   the reality of the vehicle driving simulation system, software and
   hardware are redesigned and updated during the research, particularly
   for increasing the reality of the simulation environment and future
   extensions of the driving simulation system. Accordingly, drivers can
   construct their own necessary driving situations so as to improve their
   skills. Experimentation in the visual simulation environment may reduce
   external factors of drivers, and may be repeated, so that it is a better
   approach to conduct research through the visual simulation technology.},

Abstract = {The research is now an instructor in the department of animation in a
   college, discovering that students can not pay attention to their study
   and lack of motivation to learn. Therefore, the research motivation is
   how to restore students' learning motivation and have them plunge into
   course learning. The study aimed to develop ``design strategy of peer
   learning{''} and to conduct observation in the classroom. The researcher
   took ``observation survey{''} as a research method and utilize it to
   design teaching methods, hoping to improve class learning atmosphere and
   learning attitude. Finally, based on the survey data analysis, it is
   concluded that (1) students consider it is appropriate that the teacher
   leads the curriculum but peer tutor's help is also needed; (2) design
   strategy of peer learning reduces learning difficulties and enhance
   students' learning motivation; (3) design strategy of peer learning is
   more helpful on female students than male students.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes of students
   studying at different types of high schools towards mathematics classes,
   and to test whether or not there is a meaningful difference between the
   demographic properties of the students and their attitudes. The data
   used in this study were obtained from 1,801 students studying at
   different types of high schools. The data obtained in the study showed
   that the attitudes of the students towards mathematics are at medium
   level, and that there is a meaningful difference between the attitudes
   of the students towards mathematics classes and the education levels of
   their fathers and the students' high school types. On the other hand, it
   has been determined that there is no meaningful difference between the
   gender of the students, the gender of the mathematics teachers,
   attending to an extra course, receiving private lessons for mathematics,
   their perceived success status, educational levels of their mothers, the
   income level of their families, the number of siblings, the order of the
   student in the family as a sibling, fathers' and mothers' profession,
   and the attitudes of the students. According to the Multi Linear
   Regression Analysis which was performed with the purpose of determining
   the factors affecting the attitudes of the students in the study group,
   the Gender of the Mathematics Teacher (= -.073), the Profession of the
   Mother (= - .069) and the Educational Level of the Father (= .049) have
   effects in determining the attitudes of the students towards mathematics
   classes.},

Title = {The Effect of Presentation Types and Flow on E-Book Purchase Intention},
Journal = {EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {E-book has grown into a revolutionary way of publishing due to the rapid
   development of mobile technologies. The Association of American
   Publishers (AAP) revealed that E-book sales were down in 2014. Many
   designers consider E-book should be produced with dynamic format to
   increase purchase behavior. This study focuses on individual users'
   perceived characteristics of innovation and the flow of e-books with
   different presentation types as explanatory and predictive variables
   impacting the purchase behavior of users. The experiment was conducted
   using 200 student volunteers at a comprehensive university. There are
   significant differences in the perceived characteristics of innovation,
   flow and purchase intention for different presentation types of e-book
   readers. Flow is an important factor influencing the e-book purchase
   intention and carries the same weight in each group tested. For reading
   static e-book content on a tablet, users' perceived observability and
   flow have positive impacts on their purchase intention. Conversely,
   users' perceived complexity has a negative effect on their purchase
   intention. The research results suggest that designers and publishing
   companies produce static, not dynamic e-books for use on the tablet to
   increase E-book sales.},

Abstract = {Non-formal student laboratory environments for primary and secondary
   school science education have become a major trend in the German
   educational arena in recent years. These non-formal student laboratory
   environments are thought to offer unique experimental learning
   experiences that often cannot be realized in daily school routines. The
   biggest challenge for successfully operating non-formal education is to
   carefully and firmly link outer-and inner-school learning. To better
   facilitate this linkage this paper describes a study providing insight
   into students' and teachers' expectations on visiting non-formal student
   chemistry laboratories. Over a period of three years, 461 students and
   37 teachers participated in a written survey. The results clearly show
   that students and teachers have similar expectations when visiting
   non-formal laboratory learning environments. The main foci addressed
   here concern the improvement of personal attitudes and the
   intensification of practical learning experiences.},

Abstract = {Students often find geometrical concepts abstract and difficult to
   understand. This results in poor performance, which contributes in the
   declining interest in geometry. The aim of this study was to examine the
   impact of using the free educational software program, `GeoGebra' on 9th
   grade student's mathematics achievement in learning geometry. A total of
   50 students were selected from a government school located in the
   eastern part of India. The experimental group (25) was taught theorem on
   circles using GeoGebra while the control group (25) was taught utilizing
   traditional teaching methods. At the end of the treatment, students'
   mathematics achievements were measured using a post - test. The result
   indicated that GeoGebra is an effective tool for teaching and learning
   geometry in middle school},

Abstract = {The current review examined modeling literature in top science education
   journals to better understand the pedagogical functions of modeling
   instruction reported over the last decade. Additionally, the review
   sought to understand the extent to which different modeling pedagogies
   were employed, the discursive acts that were identified as important,
   and the technology leveraged in the pursuit of engaging students in
   developing and using models. After narrowing from 783 articles
   originally identified with an abstract keyword search, the literature
   review included a database of 81 research articles whose abstracts
   revealed a focus on modeling as an instructional intervention and
   contained learner modeling. A multistage process was then completed
   whereby each article was read and information from the articles were
   identified and discussed among a group of five researchers. The most
   salient findings identified in the research included (a) conceptual
   understanding was the most common pedagogical function identified for
   modeling, while developing facility and understanding of science
   practices was identified least often, (b) Expressive modeling was the
   most frequently used and sequences which connected Exploratory and
   Experimental modeling were the most frequently observed combination of
   modeling pedagogies, (c) the most important discursive acts identified
   as important were scientific reasoning, explanation, and peer-to-peer
   collaborative/cooperative learning, and (d) technology was used in
   approximately one-half of the research reviewed, with Expressive and
   Exploratory modeling pedagogies found most often supported or mediated
   by technology.},

Abstract = {In this research internet addiction has been dealt with as predictor and
   predicted variable, this situation has been analyzed from the
   perspectives of loneliness and cognitive absorption and a tangible model
   has been put forth. Participant group has been constituted by 338
   teacher candidates. Research data were collected using loneliness scale
   (alpha=.96), cognitive absorption scale (alpha=.90) and internet
   addiction scale (alpha=.95). On the data that was obtained; structural
   equation model were used. As a result: Loneliness levels of candidate
   teachers have significant and positive direction effect on internet
   addiction. On the other hand internet addiction of teacher candidates
   affects their loneliness levels in positive direction and significantly.},

Abstract = {This study was designed to investigate the relationship between the
   metacognitive awareness of university students and their solutions to
   the similar mathematical problem types. Participants were 97 freshmen
   from department of mathematics at a state university in Turkey. Two
   different scales were used for data collection: ``Metacognitive
   Awareness Inventory{''} and ``Mathematical Problem Types Test''. The
   results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between
   the students' metacognitive awareness levels and their problem solving
   levels regarding routine and non-routine problems. There was no
   significant linear correlation between university students'
   metacognitive awareness levels and their problem solving levels for
   ``separation{''}, ``combining{''}, and ``multiplication{''} in routine
   problems. Multiple regression analysis was used to test if the
   metacognitive awareness significantly predicted participants' levels of
   problem solving. The results of the regression indicated that
   metacognitive awareness significantly predicted problem solving levels
   and both predictors explained 45\% of the total variance.},

Abstract = {This research demonstrates the design of Joyful Mobile Navigation
   Systems (JMNS), which consists of joyful, mobile, flexible and
   ubiquitous features. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and
   Integrating Learning Models (ILM) were used to design the teaching
   activities of Flow Learning and Inquiry-Based Learning in order to
   enhance learning motivation and interests for students in the ecological
   teaching activity. The developed JMNS belongs to a personalized
   informatin station of KIOSK that contains RFID bar-code recognization,
   tag reader, input device, mobile computation unit, QR-code, mobile
   display device, wireless local network and operating software. The aim
   of this research is to design and analyze the JMNS's characteristics of
   the external variables, reliability and validity by measuring through
   the Human-Computer interface, which is achieved through the
   Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS) and implemented by
   using QR Code, GPS and RFID technologies. The developed JMNS have been
   applied in real teaching activity for improving learning intention. The
   research results show that the designed JMNS and teaching activity have
   a positive significant impact on learning motivation, material
   characteristics, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude
   to use, and behavioral intention. The results also show that only
   significant of part with support for the students' system
   characteristics to the perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use.
   That is, system developers should improve the design of Context
   Awareness System of teaching to help students in mobile navigation and
   teaching activity to have a comfortable interaction and increased
   learning intention. Furthermore, using JMNS in teaching activity can
   simultaneously increase learners' motivation and offer a more joyful
   perception to learners during the learning process.},

Abstract = {Textbooks are a major tool in the teaching and learning process. This
   paper presents the results of an analysis of the Finnish and Thai 6th
   grade science textbooks: electric circuit lesson. Textual and pictorial
   information from the textbooks were analyzed under four main categories:
   1) introduction of the concepts, 2) type of knowledge, 3)
   representations, and 4) contexts. The analysis revealed that the Thai
   textbook emphasized procedural knowledge, while conceptual knowledge was
   emphasized mostly in Finnish textbook. Physics concepts are introduced
   typically through describing the relation between the new and earlier
   introduced concepts. Both textbooks employed rather traditional
   contexts, such as technical applications, technology in society, and the
   ideal context.},

Abstract = {Since Taiwan government has aggressively promoted its national capacity
   of innovative design in recent years, the need for designers with
   professional knowledge and skills has been increased significantly, and
   many colleges have established Department of Design accordingly.
   However, it was found that the fluctuation of mood of students from
   Department of Design is more significant than that from other
   Departments. The change in mood influences students' recognition of
   shapes and colors. This study applied CES-D (Center for Epidemiological
   Studies Depression) scale to test the current mood status of 120
   freshmen from Department of Design and further find out the depression
   factors. From the factors of the study, six of them have been
   independent. These factors include ``negative affect{''},
   ``interpersonal problem{''}, ``physical and mental fatigue{''},
   ``sadness and crying{''}, ``sleep disorder{''}, and ``inappetence{''}.
   In fact, students from Department of Design appear to have Atypical
   Depression physically. They conceal the melancholic symptoms so that
   other people can hardly be aware of their depression. The study results
   can be the reference for current teachers of design education.},

Abstract = {With the advent of computers virtual dissection was recognized as a
   plausible option for the replacement of hands-on dissection. Based on
   survey data collected from 489 Czech Biology teachers it was revealed
   that teachers value positively both variants of dissection, even more,
   differences are small or even negligible. Differences on motivation
   scale toward both variants are small or negligible too. From the answers
   based on motivation scale, we can construct a ghost teacher as someone
   who recognizes both alternatives of dissections as interesting, and even
   pleasant and fun activities. However, dissection should be performed as
   mostly as self-regulated activities with perceived benefits for the
   students as the dominant incentive, while not recognizing activity as
   important. The differences exist both between the acceptability of
   different kind of organisms for hands-on and virtual dissection, and in
   the actual school practice. In the long term perspective is cohabitation
   of both variants most probable.},

Abstract = {Genetics is one of the very quickly developing disciplines and it
   influences all living people. Attitudes and perception of this field of
   science can influence motivation to studying genetics and it can create
   current or future participation in this topic. The main aim was to find
   out what high school students perceptions were of genetics by the using
   of semantic differential. The sample size was created by 102 students.
   The research tool was semantic differential included 20 seven points'
   pairs of adjectives. Data was analysed by the methods descriptive (mean
   score), inferential (analysis of variance) and also multidimensional
   statistics (factor analysis). The perception of genetics is slightly
   positive and in the conclusion are suggested the proposals of further
   research.},

Abstract = {The necessity of this study was determined by the importance of the
   issue of migrant children's language adaptation. Migrant children are
   arriving in Russia having no knowledge of the Russian language but at
   the same time schools and other educational organizations are not
   prepared to cater to these children - there is a lack of tested
   methodologies that are evidence-based and effective in teaching Russian
   as a second language to migrant children. This study was aimed at (1)
   examining the process of migrant children's language adaptation in the
   context of primary school education and (2) developing an effective
   communicative methodology for teaching Russian to migrant Muslim
   children and helping them adapt. The main research method used in this
   project was a pedagogical experiment that followed observing-reporting,
   formative and control stages. We also used statistical analysis and
   expert evaluations. 152 primary school migrant children took part in our
   research project. The teaching methodology was designed with respect to
   positive language transfer (positive cross-linguistic influence) and
   linguistic interference (negative cross-linguistic influence). The main
   distinguishing feature of the developed methodology is that it is based
   on the model that uses three languages in the educational process -
   going from the native language of children (Uzbek) to Tatar and then
   transitioning to Russian. Our findings confirmed the effectiveness of
   the developed methodology as its use helped children significantly
   improve their Russian with some of them achieving the level B1 in a
   relatively short period of time. Parents, primary school teachers and
   other educators might find this article interesting and useful.},

Abstract = {Research objectives: The policy of free pay normal university students
   education is the symbol of respecting teachers and valuing education,
   and its implementation is of great strategic significance in promoting
   primary and secondary school education level in an all-around way. It is
   quite urgent to strengthen studying on education and cultivation of
   sports major free normal students. Research methods: Literature
   consultation, questionnaire survey, and mathematical statistics are
   applied to explore the effects of sports major free normal students'
   individual consciousness on education belief. Research process:
   Individual anticipation, occupational identity and integrity awareness
   are chosen as three specific dimensions of sports major free normal
   students' individual consciousness; analyses and comparison are made on
   their relative problems. Conclusions: The negative effects of individual
   anticipation on education belief comes from concerns about post-graduate
   study; In occupational identity, the realization of social status and
   individual value will contribute to inexhaustible impetus for developing
   education belief; In integrity awareness, ethical conduct has positive
   impacts on education belief. Finally, it presents an outlook of the
   future development of sports major free normal students' education

Abstract = {This article deals with the problem of arranging extracurricular
   activities for students at a modern Russian university. Research
   interest in this issue stems from the fact that extracurricular
   activities are of great concern in the development of modern students'
   professionally important qualities and their professional competence.
   There is a critical need to change the approaches to the organization of
   extracurricular activities at a university in the light of modern
   tendencies of higher education development and the opinion of faculty
   and student community. The authors focus on students' and faculty
   members' views and expectations of extracurricular activity. The
   research identified priority tasks of extracurricular activities. The
   recommendations on the organization of extracurricular activities at the
   level of the chair (department) were developed. The necessity of
   searching for a flexible, adaptive model of extracurricular activities
   at the university level is substantiated considering the specifics of
   the educational environment of a particular university; promising
   directions for further research are determined.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore the relationship between childhood
   psychological maltreatment, Mainland China college students'
   cyberbullying, moral disengagement, and moral identity by surveying 200
   college students via the Childhood Psychological Maltreatment Scale, the
   Cyberbullying Questionnaire, the Moral Disengagement Questionnaire, and
   the Moral Identity Questionnaire. The relationships are summarised from
   four viewpoints: firstly, childhood psychological maltreatment is
   significantly positive correlated with college students' cyberbullying
   and moral disengagement; secondly, childhood psychological maltreatment
   has a significant direct effect on their cyberbullying; thirdly,
   childhood psychological maltreatment has a significant indirect effect
   on their cyberbullying through moral disengagement; and fourthly, moral
   identity plays a significant role in the influences of moral
   disengagement on college students' cyberbullying. These relationships
   indicate that moral disengagement partially mediates the influences of
   childhood psychological maltreatment on college students' cyberbullying
   and that moral identity significantly moderates the influences of moral
   disengagement on college students' cyberbullying.},

Abstract = {This study adopts the methodology of corpus-based analysis and
   Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA) and uses two corpora (Chinese
   English Newspapers Corpus and American English Newspapers Corpus) as the
   source of data to make an empirical study on the use of the word,
   foreign. Major findings show that firstly Chinese English newspapers
   tend to overuse foreign and collocations of foreign are more diversified
   in Chinese English newspapers than those in native English newspapers,
   and secondly Chinese English newspapers focus on the neutral sense of
   foreign while neglecting its derogative meanings. Based on the above
   findings, pedagogical implications have been stated at last.},

Abstract = {The ideological and political education plays a crucial role in shaping
   the entrepreneurial concept of university students because it influences
   their life outlook, value outlook and world outlook. Therefore, the
   education has a significant influence on shaping the entrepreneurial
   ability of university students. The ideological and political education
   precedes the entrepreneurial spirit in practice. It starts from the
   entrepreneurial spirit of university students and gradually establishes
   the students' entrepreneurial consciousness through the later
   cultivation. The cultivation of enough entrepreneurial consciousness
   could drive the entrepreneurial behavior. Moreover, the entrepreneurial
   capability could not be described by single parameters, and it requires
   a comprehensive evaluation including professional ability, communication
   ability, decision-making ability, mental ability, vocational ability,
   management ability, values, etc. The ideological and political education
   involves multiple factors including the entrepreneurial capability. It
   is intended to cultivate students in terms of thought, experience,
   management, market, etc., analyze the comprehensive performance of
   students' entrepreneurial capability thoroughly and put forward specific
   guidance. The innovation and entrepreneurship education could give play
   to its positive guidance, conversion and standardization by fusing the
   elements of the ideological and political education. It constantly
   motivates the fighting wills of university students as well as their
   courage to overcome difficulties in the entrepreneurial process, and
   promotes the core competitiveness of university students in the future
   employment, entrepreneurship and career. By conducting a systematic
   analysis of the entrepreneurial situation and policies released by the
   Chinese government and combining the entrepreneurial mental health
   education with the service teaching, the educational concept of the
   innovation thought is quickly established, the discovery ability of
   entrepreneurial capability among students is emphasized, and the
   vertical entrepreneurial education progressive mode is established in
   which university students are guided to firmly and calmly carry out the
   entrepreneurial study and practice in the ideological and political
   education.},

Abstract = {With the development of information technology, knowledge acquisition is
   not just limited to the traditional classroom. As a rising educational
   method, ``Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs){''} has attracted
   extensive attention by educational circles. Taking 445 pieces of journal
   articles about educational study of MOOCs included in China Academic
   Journal Network Publishing database (CAJD) from 2013 to 2016 as samples,
   this study adopts bibliometric analysis method and visual knowledge
   network analysis tool CiteSpace to carry out in-depth exploration of
   aspects such as development status, developing trend, and hot subjects
   of educational study of MOOCs. The study discovers that the quantity of
   the articles about educational study of MOOCs presents a rising trend as
   a whole in the past four years. Highly cited articles mainly concentrate
   on pedagogy. A small part of articles focus on fields like library and
   information and computer science. The evolution course of study has
   experienced the process of `` introduction-development-deepening{''} and
   its hot subjects include reflection on teaching practice, modern
   teaching means and existing problems and reform path. On this basis, the
   shortcomings of the existing researches are pointed out.},

Abstract = {Computational thinking is to use heuristic reasoning to seek the
   solution of the problem, and has a strong ability to innovate. In the
   teaching of computer courses, it is one of the important subjects of
   teaching research to cultivate students' computational thinking ability.
   The traditional teaching model ignores the cognitive role of the
   students, which is not conducive to the cultivation of students'
   innovative thinking and creative ability. Blending learning is an
   inevitable trend of development in the field of higher education, and a
   hot research topic in the field of education. Inspired by ``Database
   Principles{''} course model at University of Missouri, Kansas City, a
   multi-dimensional blending learning flipped class model of computer
   courses in colleges and universities based on students' computational
   thinking ability is proposed to construct teaching model and design
   theoretical and practical teaching system and diversified teaching
   process evaluation system. In the course of ``Database Principles{''},
   the teaching practice is carried out to verify the teaching effect.},

Abstract = {With advances in various technologies, it is critical to create a
   product styling design that can trigger consumers' willingness to buy.
   Various studies have been emphasizing on product styling designs that
   can grasp a consumer's mind. Average people at this information age have
   higher demands toward product designs. When considering a purchase,
   people's first consideration is whether a product is of high quality at
   a lower price. Product competitions on the market are affected
   interactively by globalization and localization and the awareness of
   humanization and personalization. The conventional black box design
   approach makes it difficult for a designer to meet consumer demands
   effectively. Via the framework of mechanical product innovation design
   approach in this study, patent specifications were reviewed and analyzed
   in order to decompose the essential elements and their corresponding
   functions. Correlation tables were built and product structural formula
   could be determined. More functions were included by replacing elements
   in order to achieve the completeness of the structural formula. For
   demonstrating the benefits of this approach, the design of computer
   cooling fan housing was chosen as a case study. The results indicated
   that the proposed design approach can effectively assist in the
   development of product innovative designs.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to evaluate the school and classroom rules
   of primary schools in Northern Cyprus in accordance with the classroom
   teachers' opinions. In this research, conducted within this scope of
   this particular aim, the qualitative method of interviewing has been
   utilised. The research's population consists of classroom teachers who
   teach Turkish, Mathematics, Science and Technology and Social Sciences
   employed in primary schools in Northern Cyprus. The sample group of the
   research is formed of 55 classroom teachers chosen with the maximum
   variation sampling method. A semi-structured interview form developed by
   researchers for classroom teachers has been used as the data gathering
   tool of the research. Case study was also used in this qualitative
   research as a research model. The implementation period of the research

Abstract = {In this study, on the basis of summarizing the current situation of
   online learning behavior and related theoretical research. Based on the
   analysis of related research results, considering the existing problems,
   the main contents of this paper include the following aspects: (1)
   Define the connotation of online learning behavior, and introduce the
   theory of artificial intelligence into the classification of online
   learning behavior from structural dimension, functional dimension and
   mode dimension; (2) According to the overall architecture of the
   analysis model, the analysis model is constructed from left to right and
   top to down under the big data environment. The online learning behavior
   data model is constructed from the multi-dimensional and multi-level
   perspective to determine the source, method and process of data
   collection. After that, designs the horizontal and longitudinal
   processes of the online learning behavior analysis model. On this basis,
   using the big data processing technology on the online learning behavior
   analysis model in all aspects of the specific algorithms involved in the
   implementation. (4) We chose the online learning platform of China
   Business Executives Academy, Dalian to do empirical analysis. In-depth
   study from the following three aspects: the learning behavior clustering
   analysis based on K-means algorithm, the individualized course
   recommendation analysis based on Page Rank algorithm and the correlation
   analysis of learning effects.},

Abstract = {The network marketing as a direct sale method has been widely recognised
   in Turkey. Today the consumption is not only comprised of the diversity
   of provided goods and services or their functional use but also some
   other various reasons. The functional consumption is generally
   considered the main reason behind the purchasing behaviour.
   Additionally, the consumers are influenced by the social meaning
   transmitted by a product or brand like a social expression of status or
   image. Moreover the consumers has become increasingly aware in respect
   of making product choices to fulfil their needs in the way to minimise
   the impact on the environment and their own health. The sample size of
   this research is a group of 504 people among the network-marketing
   customers in Turkey. The role of environmental consciousness and
   environmental education in the impact of conspicuous consumption on the
   re-buying decisions was assessed through an interview method. The
   structural equation methodology was utilised to evaluate the relations
   between the research variables. The model was tested with the structural
   equation method and a significant positive impact was identified between
   the environmentally product consciousness and re-buying decision. Unlike
   the environmentally product consciousness, no significant relation was
   identified between the conspicuous consumption and re-buying decision.},

Abstract = {The present survey research was aimed at identifying the ICT facilities,
   skills, usage, and the problems faced by the students of higher
   education while using ICT. The population of the study comprised the
   students of public sector universities of Lahore, Pakistan. Instrument
   was developed by the first author. About 250 students were selected from
   three public universities. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze
   the data. The findings revealed that the students have computers and
   Internet facilities at home and universities. They are expert at simple
   skills like MS Word, MS Power Point, Searching and Browsing at Internet,
   Social networking, Email, File attachment, and Computer games but are
   less skilled or poor on other skills like using digital library,
   discussion forums, and Blogs. Students spend more time on computers for
   recreational and other purposes than for academic purpose. They believe
   that the use of ICT supports their learning. Slow speed of computers,
   signal problem in Internet, virus threat, poor working condition of
   computers, load shedding, and lack of access of Internet are the
   problems faced by the majority of the students. The universities should
   invest more on improving the infrastructure to address the ICT related
   problems of students at the universities.},

Abstract = {In this study, online learning refers students under the guidance of
   teachers through the online learning platform for organized learning.
   Based on the analysis of related research results, considering the
   existing problems, the main contents of this paper include the following
   aspects: (1) analyze and study the current student engagement model, In
   view of the characteristics of online learning activities and online
   student characteristics, this paper introduced the student engagement
   model from the student behavior engagement, knowledge engagement and
   emotional engagement three dimensions; (2) analysis student `s
   behavioral engagement. The degree of student engagement is mainly
   calculated by the student's learning behavior data. Then used related
   methods to calculate learning behavior of student engagement degree. To
   develop the evaluation indicators of these learning behaviors, to study
   the method of calculating student engagement through these behaviors.
   (3) Analysis of Students' Cognitive Engagement. Through study the
   relevant literature of students' cognitive engagement and analyze the
   contents of the student's course of study, To develop the corresponding
   evaluation index and evaluate the students' cognitive engagement degree.
   (4) Analysis of students' emotional experience degree. Used the
   self-evaluation method to obtain students e experience information
   during online learning, to quantify students emotional experience degree
   and analysis.},

Title = {Development of Classification Thinking in Future Teachers: Technologies

Abstract = {The main objective of the research is to create and approbate a new way
   of reflection formation in future teachers, which would increase the
   level of classifying thinking to the theoretical one. The ``Formation of
   equivalence groups{''} technique was modified to conduct the experiment.
   It was carried out both individually and in collaborative discussions in
   pairs which involved justification. This made it possible to reveal the
   degree of the reflection conformity to the norms of scientific thinking
   in solving classification problems, the main obstacles to the
   application of these norms and ways to overcome them. Results. As a
   result the ways of reflection were identified. The experiment resulted
   in the identification of two ways of substantiating solutions to
   classification tasks and processes of reflection: reflexive and
   pseudo-reflexive. The typology of pseudo-reflexive assessments is
   presented. Evaluation of an intuitively correct solution to a task
   anticipates a cogent justification of the reflexive process.
   Underdeveloped reflexive processes can limit the capacity of adults for
   scientific classification thinking. Existing methods of logic classes
   study at a higher school context do not provide well-developed
   scientific theoretical knowledge. Existing methods do not provide its
   scientific-theoretical level. Reflexive processes corresponding to this
   type of thinking are to be developed in a classification logic norms
   study. A wider use of specific sign means will provide an effective
   differentiation of reflexive and pseudo-reflexive forms. The development
   and enhancement of reflexive processes in relation to the assessment of
   educational outcomes can be undertaken with the help of formalized
   tools. Presented in the article technology of pseudo reflexive forms
   diagnostics and technology of reflection initiation based on the logic
   of classes promotes the rise of classification thinking to the
   theoretical level. The proposed type of tasks is not connected with the
   content of a certain scientific discipline and can be applied at
   different levels of education.},

Abstract = {The value of a high-tech industry no longer lies in the number of
   plants, equipment, and products but the intellectual property, customer
   confidence, capability of collaborating with business partners,
   telecommunication infrastructure, and the creativity potential and
   skills of its employees. This study is motivated by investigating the
   way of constructing an environmental atmosphere for employees to enjoy
   their works and create, learn, communicate, and share their knowledge
   for a high-tech industry. It is also expected to provide guidance for an
   employee to integrate his/her personal goal with the organization's so
   that he/she can keep contributing to the organization. The management
   levels and employees at the Weihai Huoju High-Tech Industrial
   Development Zone were selected as the research subjects in this study. A
   total of 500 questionnaire copies were dispatched and the number of
   valid questionnaire copies being returned was 376 with a rate of
   response as 75\%. The results of this study are as follows. 1. The
   influence of a learning organization on organizational communications is
   positively significant. 2. The influence of organizational
   communications on organizational creativity is positively significant.
   3. The influence of a learning organization on organizational creativity
   is positive. Conclusions and recommendations are proposed in study based
   on the research results with the expectation to turn a high tech
   industry into a learning organization and provide guidance for
   organizational communication and organizational creativity.},

   teach. This paper reports on a case study exploring reflections on
   teaching periodic table concepts in five secondary schools from South
   Africa. Qualitative methodology of interviews and document analysis were
   used to collect data from five participants that were purposively
   selected. One specific research question was addressed: what practices
   inform Physical Sciences teachers when teaching periodic table of
   elements? Results showed that all participants were able to describe
   specific teaching and learning difficulties, such as relating the
   properties of substances to characteristics of the constituent
   particles. They further, recognised the importance of using models of
   atoms and molecules to promote understanding. These findings have
   implications for science teaching, learning and teacher education.},

Abstract = {The current opportunities to develop and acquire knowledge in the
   network, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) play a major
   role in the learning process. This research offers a bibliometric
   analysis in order to examine the state of the research activity carried
   out in relation to the learning communities based on ICT. The indicators
   obtained show steady growth since the study of ICT applied to models of
   teaching and learning began in the nineties, presenting a significant
   increase in interest on the subject in the year 2005 and the highest
   productivity of publications in the years 2010 and 2011. The countries
   with the largest contribution to the study of ICT in learning contexts
   are China, the US and Taiwan, leading research processes in the area. It
   was possible to identify that some of the issues that have emergent
   behavior are related to knowledge sharing, confidence-building
   mechanisms and networked learning.},

Abstract = {This paper reflects thorough consideration of cultural perspectives in
   the establishment of science curriculum development principles in
   Taiwan. The authority explicitly states that education measures and
   activities of aboriginal peoples' ethnic group should be implemented
   consistently to incorporate their history, language, art, living
   customs, social system, ecology utilization, and value system. However,
   current educational practices in science education seriously neglect the
   importance of aboriginal cultures and values. To establish an index of
   curriculum development principles in Aboriginal Science Education, this
   study applies several research tools, such as fieldwork, expert
   interviews, panel discussions, and the Delphi method. Five dimensions
   are implemented to address the diverse needs of aboriginal students:
   local standard, cultural response, cognitive approach, learning
   interest, and learning effectiveness. The study aims to reach two
   specific perspectives: 1) promote Aboriginal Science Curriculum with
   valuable research findings to influence future policy making; and 2)
   assist aboriginal students in understanding the significance of culture
   aspects in their science education.},

Abstract = {Virtual reality captures people's attention. This technology has been
   applied in many sectors such as medicine, industry, education, video
   games, or tourism. Perhaps its biggest area of interest has been leisure
   and entertainment. Regardless the sector, the introduction of virtual or
   augmented reality had several constraints: it was expensive, it had poor
   ergonomics, or implied too much work to create contents. Recent
   technological innovations, including the rapid adoption of smartphones
   by society, have facilitated the access to virtual reality and augmented
   reality of anyone. In addition, several large companies like Apple,
   Facebook, Samsung, and Magic Leap, among others, have increased their
   investment to make these technologies to improve their accessibility
   within the next few years. Educational institutions will benefit from
   better accessibility to virtual technologies; this will make it possible
   to teach in virtual environments that are impossible to visualize in
   physical classrooms, like accessing into virtual laboratories,
   visualizing machines, industrial plants, or even medical scenarios. The
   huge possibilities of accessible virtual technologies will make it
   possible to break the boundaries of formal education.},

Abstract = {Regardless of the social or economic status of a student, it is a fact
   that math is always present. This discipline is considered as a
   competitive tool for achieving a more productive life. However, the gap
   in academic achievement is big. Consequently, in the last decades the
   research on education has set attention on this point. Therefore, this
   research aims to prove that there is anxiety toward math on high school
   students at a private institution Rioverde in San Luis Potosi, Mexico
   and find if there is a difference in regards to gender. We used Auzmendi
   sub-scale questionnaire. The results show that there is anxiety toward
   math on high school students, and that women show more anxiety toward
   math than men do. Thus, we conclude, for the case under study, that
   anxiety toward math is a learning issue for high school students, more
   often for women than for men.},

Abstract = {Taiwan is a densely populated industrialized country with high-polluting
   industries. In particular, petrochemical, steel, thermal power, and
   electronics plants consume a high level of energy. Furthermore, vehicle
   exhaust emissions are a major contributor to pollution. Collectively,
   these problems have resulted in high levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
   To solve these problems, the government of Taiwan has been active in
   promoting policies aimed at cultivating seed teachers in field of
   environmental education. In addition, courses on environmental
   protection have been made mandatory for students at all levels of
   education, from elementary school to university. To enhance the
   effectiveness of cultivating seed teachers in this field, this study
   adopted the analytic hierarchy process and utility theory to identify
   critical factors influencing the success of this initiative in
   environmental education. The results may serve as a reference in the
   formulation of future policies to environmental protection and
   education.},

Abstract = {Hands-on making (e.g., ``Maker{''}) has become prevalent in current
   educational settings. To understand the role that students' epistemic
   curiosity plays in hands-on making contests, this study explored its
   correlation to students' positive affect and continuance intention to
   participate in a hands-on making contest called ``PowerTech{''}.
   PowerTech requires students to produce miniatures in the morning and use
   the miniatures to take part in relay racing and tug-of-war competitions
   in the afternoon. Data from 514 individuals were collected and subjected
   to confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling by AMOS
   20. The results revealed the two types of epistemic curiosity (EC),
   interest (I-type) and informational deprivation type (D-type), played a
   mediating role in bonding participants' positive affect and their
   continuance intention to join a hands-on making contest. The implication
   of this study suggests students' epistemic curiosity can be aroused in
   the process of participating in competitive handson making contests such
   as PowerTech.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to design a modeling task to facilitate
   students' inquiries into the chain rule in calculus and to analyze the
   results after implementation of the task. In this study, we take a
   modeling approach to the teaching and learning of the chain rule by
   facilitating the generalization of students' models and modeling
   activities. We assumed abductive reasoning to be one of the key factors
   which can support the generalization of students' models and modeling
   activities. We believe that analogical reasoning and diagrammatic
   reasoning are key factors in fostering students' use of abduction. As a
   result, we determined that the students' models and modeling activities
   were generalized to the chain rule by their use of abductive reasoning,
   and the students found the chain rule to be a generalized rule for
   describing changes of various quantities.},

Abstract = {To date, researchers have frequently investigated students' attitudes
   toward courses supported by problem-based learning. There are several
   studies with different results in the literature. It is necessary to
   combine and interpret the findings of these studies through a
   meta-analysis method. This method aims to combine different results of
   similar and independent studies through statistical techniques. Research
   findings of 47 studies that meet the criteria for meta-analysis are
   included in the meta-analysis of the study to determine the effects of
   problem-based learning on students' attitudes as compared to traditional
   teaching. Also, some mediator variables are as follows: the status of a
   study, application time, education levels, scientific field of
   application, and sample size. As a result of the analysis, it has been
   found that problem-based learning has a low positive effect on students'
   attitudes. It means that problem-based learning is effective in helping
   students gain a positive attitude toward courses.},

Abstract = {Amphibians play an important role in the functioning of ecosystems and
   some of them inhabit human gardens where they can successfully
   reproduce. The decline of amphibian diversity worldwide suggests that
   people may play a crucial role in their survival. We conducted a
   cross-cultural study on high school students' tolerance of frogs in
   Chile, Slovakia, South Africa and Turkey (n = 655 high school students).
   We found that about 6 \% of students reported active killing of frogs
   and 30 \% reported moving frogs away from their home gardens. Pathogen
   disgust negatively correlated with frog tolerance suggesting that people
   who are more sensitive to pathogen conoting cues are less tolerant
   toward frogs. Tolerance of frogs in parents or other family members
   appears to significantly influence student tolerance of frogs. Females
   tended to show higher tolerance of frogs than males. This study
   highlights the importance of the emotion of disgust in human willingness
   to protect frogs from a cross-cultural perspective.},

Abstract = {Problem solving is not simply a process that ends when an answer is
   found; it is a scientific process that evolves from understanding the
   problem to evaluating the solution. This process is affected by several
   factors. Among these, one of the most substantial is belief. The purpose
   of this study was to evaluate the beliefs of high school students
   according to their explanations in the problem solving process. A case
   study was carried out with five students. Each of the students' problem
   solving processes was examined by means of clinical interviews and three
   problems were presented to the students. The results illustrate that the
   students who thought problem solving should be a short process and that
   they could address it by memorization of rules also believed that
   problem solving is difficult. This study concludes that not only beliefs
   affect the problem solving process, but also personal factors such as
   life experiences.},

Abstract = {Game-based learning is an effective learning method, whose performance
   depends on the quality of the educational game. Due to versatile game
   environments with complex backgrounds, evaluations are not easy to
   implement. Consequently, it is difficult for educators to determine to
   what degree a game may be qualified. This study proposes a novel,
   multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) model based on Flow theory to
   help educators evaluate educational games. This study designs a Flow
   dimension questionnaire in which some domain experts are asked to
   re-examine the attributes of the Flow dimension by using the Delphi
   method. The extracted attributes of Flow dimension are then employed to
   build the proposed model for evaluating a given educational game. For
   practical implementation, this study developed an Evaluating
   Mobile-Learning Game System (EMGS), based on the proposed model. In the
   case study, several experts were requested to use the developed system
   for evaluating three different types of educational games. After the
   evaluation process, the experts were invited to fill out a questionnaire
   of system satisfaction. The results show that the developed system is
   faster and more convenient than the traditional evaluation method, and
   the developed system could effectively recommend the best qualified
   educational game for educators in different situations.},

Abstract = {In this self-study, we aimed to delve into how re-designing and teaching
   re-designed practicum course offered to pre-service teachers (PTs)
   enriched our, as science teacher educators, development of pedagogical
   content knowledge (PCK) for teaching science teachers. This self-study
   was conducted during a compulsory practicum course in which we served as
   teaching assistants (TAs). The qualitative data collected through
   journal entries written by the help of mentoring experience, Content
   Representation (CoRe), reflection papers, formal observations of PTs'
   teaching practices and microteaching each week, formal and informal
   meetings with PTs. The results were presented through vignettes that
   included an emphasis on a critical examination of our prior practices,
   the changes made in the practicum, and the difficulties that PTs faced.
   This self-study was valuable for us regarding the development of our PCK
   and building interplay among all PCK components. In light of the
   experience we gained, implications for science teacher education and
   research were provided.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between pre-service science
   teachers. written argumentation levels about socio-scientific issues and
   epistemic belief levels in an online discussion environment. A
   mixed-methods approach was used: 30 Turkish pre-service science teachers
   contributed with their written argumentations to four socio-scientific
   issues. The pre-service science teachers. argumentations were evaluated
   by an adapted version of argumentation analysis framework developed by
   Sadler and Fowler (2006) and their epistemic belief levels were measured
   using the Epistemic Belief Questionnaire by Kuhn, Cheney, and Weinstock
   (2000). The qualitative as well as quantitative results indicated that:
   (1) the pre-service science teachers produced high-level argumentations
   for each socio-scientific issue in an online discussion environment, (2)
   levels of argumentations increased from climate change to human genome
   project issue, and (3) higher-level argumentations were produced for
   higher epistemic belief levels (i.e., multiplist and evaluativist).},

   concepts. The States of Matter Diagnostic Test (SMDT) is a 19-item
   three-tier diagnostic test consisting of three-tier items for assessing
   students' understanding of states of matter concepts. The SMDT was
   administered to 195 10th grade high school students in the pilot study
   and 102 10th grade high school students in the main study. Cronbach
   alpha reliability indexes for the SMDT were estimated to be .78 and .83
   for the pilot and main study, respectively. Point-biserial coefficients
   ranged from .20 to .69 with an average of .44 for the pilot study and
   with an average of .49 for the main study.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
   technology-embedded scientific inquiry (TESI) on senior science student
   teachers' (SSSTs) self-efficacy. The sample consisted of 117 SSSTs (68
   females and 49 males aged 21-23 years) enrolled in an Environmental
   Chemistry elective course. Within a quasi-experimental design, the
   technology-embedded scientific inquiry self-efficacy adapted from
   Ebenezer (2008), was used to collect data. The results revealed that the
   proposed TESI model was acceptable and feasible for the related context.
   Also, it can be deduced that interaction amongst the three hallmarks of
   the TESI model resulted in increasing the SSSTs' self-efficacy. A
   longitudinal study with the science student teachers is suggested to get
   more detailed information concerning applicability of the TESI model and
   TESI self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {Information and Communication Technology has allowed the use of several
   types of visualizations, especially multimedia environments in science
   teaching. The aim was to investigate how in-service teachers enrolled in
   a training course understand the nature and the role of visualizations
   in science teaching as well as the impact of this training on the change
   of their conceptions. A questionnaire to identify previous conceptions
   has been applied. It was analyzed the Teaching Learning Sequence made by
   them and the audiovisual record of their speeches and semi-structured
   interview with these teachers' groups. As the main result, we highlight
   development of the knowledge about these tools, especially on the impact
   of the visual language on apprenticeship and on the notion of scientific
   model.},

Abstract = {Urban design plays an important role in architectural education and its
   subdivisions. When architects are looking at cities, they not only
   recognize three dimensionality and geographical appearances of spaces
   but also see the necessity of incorporating artistic, cultural, social,
   environmental and psychological elements alongside. Urban design is
   currently studied as a fundamental discipline with the use of developing
   technology and influential changes in educational practices, pedagogies
   and methods. In this study, the artistic aesthetic principles of Hermann
   Maertens towards monuments and public squares are used to analyze
   theoretical planning of urban spaces together with technological
   transformations in the practice with an educational software program
   called Space Syntax ``depth map{''} as a case-study to redefine the
   multi-disciplinary perspectives of urban design; artistic, cultural,
   social, psychological as well as accessibility and usability
   perspectives. The analysis puts forth the necessity of new
   multidisciplinary approaches in urban design practices and education.},

Title = {Reason and Emotion: How They Drive Students to Play a Color Game},
Journal = {EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {1911-1924},
Abstract = {Chromatics has been an important subject in design education since
   colors can make significant differences in the meanings and values of
   designed objects. However, only a few studies sought to assist students
   in learning chromatics, let alone to investigate their views on mobile
   game-based learning of this subject. To remedy these deficiencies, we
   firstly developed a color game to help students learn chromatics through
   color mixing. Then, drawing on reasonable and emotional factors, we
   designed a research model to investigate the students' decision-making
   about the game. After analyzing the feedbacks from a total of 205
   students, this study showed that (1) perceived attractiveness was the
   most significant emotional factor behind the subjects' intention to play
   the game; (2) perceived usefulness was a reasonable factor that
   indirectly influenced the subjects' intention; (3) perceived enjoyment,
   as another emotional factor, exerted a significant and direct influence
   on the subjects' perceived usefulness. These findings indicated that
   emotional factors played not only a pivotal role in the subjects'
   intention to play the color game but also a leading one in their
   reasonable response to the game.},

Abstract = {The study explored Taiwanese students' mathematics learning at the
   junior high school level. Utilizing structural equation modeling, it
   examined the relationships between math self-concept and mathematics
   achievement with longitudinal data. Participants included 1,256
   Taiwanese seventh graders in the first wave and declined slightly to
   1,211 eighth graders in the second wave. Findings indicated the
   following. First, the longitudinal effects were all significant: (a)
   prior mathematics achievement significantly predicted subsequent math
   self-concept (skill development model), (b) prior math self-concept
   significantly predicted subsequent mathematics achievement (self
   enhancement model), and (c) the reciprocal effects model was supported,
   and the effects of achievement tended to become stronger and more
   systematic. Second, results showed significant gender variation with
   respect to math self-concept and mathematics achievement. Boys had
   significantly higher math self-concept than girls, whereas girls
   exhibited higher mathematics achievement than boys. The implications of
   these findings for cultivating students' interest in mathematics
   learning were discussed.},

Abstract = {To investigate the impact of the core enterprise network competence on
   innovation network governance performance, this paper introduces network
   characteristics as an intermediary variable and constructs a conceptual
   model according to the core enterprise network competence, the network
   characteristics and the governance performance of the innovation
   network. This paper also conducts empirical research using 543 survey
   data. The results show that network vision, network development, network
   relationship management and network combination management competences
   as well as network characteristics all have a positive impact on
   governance performance. Network characteristics have a partial mediating
   effect on the relationship among network development, network
   relationship management, and network combination management competences
   and governance performance; however, network characteristics have no
   significant mediating effect on the relationship between network vision
   competence and governance performance. This research will help Chinese
   enterprises better cultivate network competence and can provide a
   reference for the improvement of innovation network governance
   performance.},
