Abstract = {This exploratory study investigated the behaviors and content of
   onscreen calculator usage by a nationally representative sample of
   eighth-grade students who responded to items from the 2017 National
   Assessment of Educational Progress mathematics assess-ment. Meaningful
   features were generated from the process data to infer whether students
   spontaneously used calculators for mathematical problem solving, how
   frequently and when they used them, and the nature of the operations
   performed on calculators. Sequential pattern mining was applied on
   sequences of calculator keystrokes to obtain patterns of operations that
   were representa-tive of students' problem-solving strategies or
   processes. Results indicated that higher scoring students not only were
   more likely to use calculators, but also used them in a more goal-driven
   manner than lower scoring students.},

Abstract = {Past studies have documented students' and teachers' persistent
   difficulties in determining whether 2 quantities covary in a direct
   proportion, especially when presented missing-value word problems. In
   the current study, we combine a mathematical analysis with a
   psychological perspective to offer anew explanation for such
   difficulties. The mathematical analysis highlights numbers of
   equal-sized groups and places reasoning about proportional relationships
   in the context of reasoning about multiplicative relationships more
   generally. The psychological perspective is rooted in diSessa's
   (diSessa, 1993, 2006; diSessa, Sherin, \& Levin, 2016)
   knowledge-in-pieces epistemology and highlights diverse, fine-grained
   knowledge resources that can support inferring and reasoning with
   equal-sized groups. We illustrate how the combination of mathematical
   analysis and psychological perspective may be applied to data using
   empirical examples drawn from interviews during which preservice middle
   grades teachers reasoned with varying degrees of success about
   relationships presented in word problems that were and were not
   proportional.},

Abstract = {In this research commentary, I argue that the field of mathematics
   education, as a whole can and should improve its citation practices. I
   begin by discussing 4 forms of citation practice and considering how
   they vary with respect to transparency of voice. I then discuss several
   ways our citation practices may misrepresent cited authors' ideas,
   providing examples to illustrate the errors. I conclude by suggesting
   ways that we as writers (but also as reviewers and as graduate faculty)
   might jointly work toward improving our citation practices.},

Abstract = {In a recent article, Inglis and Alcock (2012) contended that their data
   challenge the claim that when mathematicians validate proofs, they
   initially skim a proof to grasp its main idea prior to reading
   individual parts of the proof more carefully. This result is based on
   the fact that when mathematicians read proofs in their study, on average
   their initial reading of a proof took half as long as their total time
   spent reading that proof. However, inferring individuals' strategy use
   by averaging their reaction times across multiple trials is problematic.
   We present a more fine-grained analysis of Inglis and Alcock's data that
   suggests that mathematicians frequently used an initial skimming
   strategy when engaging in proof validation tasks.},

Abstract = {Currently, there are more theories of learning in use in mathematics
   education research than ever before (Lerman \& Tsatsaroni, 2004).
   Although this is a positive sign for the field, it also has brought With
   it a set of challenges. In this article, I identify some of these
   challenges and consider how mathematics education researchers might
   think about, and work with, the multiple theories available. I present
   alternatives to views of the competition or supersession of theories and
   indicate the kinds of discussions that will support effective theory use
   in mathematics education research. I describe the potential for
   mathematics education researchers to make informed, justified choices of
   a theory or theories to address particular research agendas.},

Abstract = {This article makes a contribution toward clarifying what mathematical
   reasoning is and what it looks like in school contexts. It describes one
   pattern of reasoning observed in the mathematical activity of students
   in a Grade 5 class and discusses ways in which this pattern is or is not
   mathematical in order to clarify the features of a pattern of reasoning
   that are important for making such a judgment. The pattern involves
   conjecturing a general rule, testing that rule, and then either using it
   for further exploration, rejecting it, or modifying it. Each element of
   reasoning in this pattern is described in terms of the ways of reasoning
   used and the degree of formulation of the reasoning. A distinction is

Abstract = {The analysis reported in this paper contributes to the effort to
   understand how mathematics teachers might proactively support their
   students' mathematical learning by documenting one first-grade teacher's
   role in guiding the development of sociomathematical norms in her
   classroom. We highlight the learning opportunities that arose for both
   the teacher and her students during this process, The analysis therefore
   serves to clarify what teachers might actually do to support the
   emergence of the type of mathematical disposition advocated in reform
   documents. In addition, the analysis describes the decision-making
   processes that were involved in setting the teacher's agenda. This
   aspect of the paper focuses on the teacher's interactions as part of a
   research team whose dual focus was to support both the students.
   mathematical learning and their development of mathematical autonomy.
   The analysis was informed by and builds on Yackel and Cobb's (1996)
   discussion of sociomathematical norms.},

Abstract = {Four preservice elementary teachers were studied during a field-based
   mathematics methods course. The purpose of the study was to investigate
   the elements of mathematics teaching and learning the preservice
   teachers found problematic and how they resolved those problems. Data
   were collected in the form of individual interviews, group discussions,
   and individual journals. The preservice teachers exhibited concerns
   about the classroom context, pedagogy of mathematics, children's
   mathematical thinking, and, to a lesser extent, the mathematics content.
   The data indicate a relationship between the preservice teachers' locus
   of authority and the reflective quality of their thinking.},

Abstract = {A new curriculum to introduce rational numbers was devised, using
   developmental theory as a guide. The Ist topic in the curriculum was
   percent in a linear-measurement context, in which halving as a
   computational strategy was emphasized. Two-place decimals were
   introduced next, followed by 3- and I-place decimals. Fractional
   notation was introduced last, as an alternative form for representing
   decimals. Sixteen 4th-grade students received the experimental
   curriculum. Thirteen carefully matched control students received a
   traditional curriculum. After instruction, students in the treatment
   group showed a deeper understanding of rational numbers than those in
   the; control group, showed less reliance on whole number strategies when
   solving novel problems, and made more frequent reference to proportional
   concepts in justifying their answers. Na differences were found in
   conventional computation between the 2 groups.},

Title = {INVARIANCE OF RATIO - THE CASE OF CHILDRENS ANTICIPATORY SCHEME FOR
   CONSTANCY OF TASTE},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {In this article we study the concept of invariance of ratio through an
   investigation of children's understanding of constancy of taste-that is,
   the notion that random samples of a given mixture taste the same-using a
   device that does not resort to conventional symbolism. The paper begins
   with a definition of constancy of taste and other quantitative
   analogues. Then it presents a theoretical analysis of how constancy of
   taste may emerge from the child's additive world and grow into a
   conception where taste becomes an intensive quantity. The analysis
   suggests that one's conception of taste constancy is linked in a
   fundamental way to one's conception of invariance of ratio. Following
   this analysis, the paper reports a study that demonstrates the absence
   of taste constancy among sixth-grade children. More specifically, the
   study shows that sixth-grade children base their judgment of the
   relative strength of the taste of two samples from the same mixture on
   at least one of three (extraneous) variables: the relative volumes of
   the samples to be tasted, whether the mixture is thought of as
   consisting of a single ingredient or more than one ingredient, and the
   relative amount of the ingredients stated in the problem.},

Abstract = {Few students exhibit number sense when solving arithmetic problems in
   school. This study examined the effects of an intervention in the
   instruction of seventh-grade students for the purpose of developing
   number sense. Students were taught by the classroom teacher from
   experimental units on number magnitude, mental computation, and
   computational estimation. Instruction was designed to provide rich
   opportunities for exploring numbers, number relationships, and number
   operations and to discover rules and invent algorithms. Written measures
   and interviews before instruction, immediately after instruction, and
   several months later revealed that after instruction students were more
   likely to elect to use strategies that reflected number sense and that
   this was a long-term change. It appeared to the investigators that the
   students reorganized and used existing knowledge rather than acquiring
   new knowledge structures.},

Abstract = {A structural model of mathematics achievement and attitude was tested
   with a national probability sample of 3,116 young adolescents from the
   Longitudinal Study of American Youth using structural modeling. A
   three-wave longitudinal design incorporated data from students,
   teachers, and parents to construct a prespecified theoretical model of
   mathematics achievement and mathematics attitude. A revised model
   provided a better fit than the original specification and than
   regression models used in 23 previous studies. Supported in
   cross-validation. the model revealed a complexity of direct and indirect
   effects not apparent in previous studies. Prior achievement and home
   environment influenced subsequent achievement most powerfully;
   motivation, exposure to extramural reading media, peer environment, and
   instructional exposure also had significant influences on achievement.
   Previous attitude had the most powerful influence on subsequent
   attitude, although the direct effects of instructional quality and the
   indirect effects of motivation and home environment were also notable.
   Appropriate teacher use of instructional time, thorough textbook
   coverage, and daily introduction of new material, although educationally
   alterable, are themselves influenced by previous student achievement.
   Similarly, instructional practices are significant alterable influences
   on mathematics attitudes, but such practices are themselves influenced
   by students' initial attitudes.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this commentary is to acknowledge, illuminate, and
   counter the noticeable silences in the investigations of mathematics
   education researchers who conduct equity research with Black communities
   and other marginalized groups. For far too long, these communities have
   experienced a lengthy and complicated history of structural barriers;
   epistemological, symbolic, and intellectual violence; dehumanization;
   and antiblackness in mathematics education research. We advance the
   Critical-Historical (CritHistory) framework, which is rooted in critical
   race theory (CRT) and further explicates CRT's tenet of challenging
   ahistoricism. We discuss methodologies and implications, including
   example questions that could be posed, types and locations of archives
   that could be examined, and populations with whom oral histories could
   be conducted.},

Abstract = {Even in simple mathematical situations, there is an array of different
   mathematical features that students can attend to or notice. What
   students notice mathematically has consequences for their subsequent
   reasoning. By adapting work from both cognitive science and applied
   linguistics anthropology, we present a focusing framework, which treats
   noticing as a complex phenomenon that is distributed across individual
   cognition, social interactions, material resources, and normed
   practices. Specifically, this research demonstrates that different
   centers of focus emerged in two middle grades mathematics classes
   addressing the same content goals, which, in turn, were related
   conceptually to differences in student reasoning on subsequent interview
   tasks. Furthermore, differences in the discourse practices, features of
   the mathematical tasks, and the nature of the mathematical activity in
   the two classrooms were related to the different mathematical features
   that students appeared to notice.},

Abstract = {This study investigated whether an intervention including an online game
   contributed to 236 Grade 6 students' performance in early algebra, that
   is, solving problems with covarying quantities. An exploratory
   quasi-experimental study was conducted with a
   pretest-posttest-control-group design. Students in the experimental
   group were asked to solve at home a number of problems by playing an
   online game. Special software recorded students' online activity Before
   and after the intervention, a paper-and-pencil test on early-algebra
   problem solving was administered. Statistical analyses showed a
   significant positive effect of the intervention on posttest performance
   when controlling for pretest performance, mathematical ability, and
   gender. Although boys outperformed girls in early algebra performance on
   the pretest as well as on the posttest, boys and girls profited equally
   from the intervention. Implications of these results for educational
   practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {This case study examines the practice of a full-time mathematics teacher
   and social activist working in a secondary school with the twin missions
   of college preparation and social justice. Findings detail how this
   teacher views the relationship between mathematics education and social
   justice and how her conception of teaching for social justice is enacted
   in her mathematics classes. Interview data and excerpts of classroom
   practice are used to describe how the teacher negotiates 2 dilemmas in
   her teaching: the challenge of fostering students'
   independence/interdependence and the problem of dominant mathematics as
   a necessity/obstacle to social justice.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate children's construction of
   10s out of the Is they have already constructed. Ninety-eight children
   in Grades K-4 were individually interviewed in a store game in which
   they were the storekeepers and the interviewer was the customer buying
   candy. We tried to find out how children gave change when payment was
   made with a dime or a dime and a few pennies for purchases up to 9
   cents. It was found that, for many younger children, a dime was
   something different from 10 pennies even though they could say with
   confidence that a dime was worth 10 cents. As the children grew older,
   their performance improved. Educational implications are discussed.},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Research investigating algebra students' abilities to generalize and
   justify suggests that they experience difficulty in creating and using
   appropriate generalizations and proofs. Although the field has
   documented students' errors, less is known about what students do
   understand to be general and convincing. This study examines the ways in
   which seven middle school students generalized and justified while
   exploring linear functions. Students' generalizations and proof schemes
   were identified and categorized in order to establish connections
   between types of generalizations and types of justifications. These
   connections led to the identification of four mechanisms for change that
   supported students' engagement in increasingly sophisticated forms of
   algebraic reasoning: (a) iterative action/reflection cycles, (b)
   mathematical focus, (c) generalizations that promote deductive
   reasoning, and (d) influence of deductive reasoning on generalizing.},

Abstract = {The framework of Tharp and Gallimore (1988) was adapted to form a ZPD
   (Zone of Proximal Development) Model of Mathematical Proficiency that
   identifies two interacting kinds of learning activities: instructional
   conversations that assist understanding and practice that develops
   fluency. A Class Learning Path was conceptualized as a classroom path
   that includes a small number of different learning paths followed by
   students, and it permits a teacher to provide assistance to students at
   their own levels. A case study illustrates this model by describing how
   one teacher in a Japanese Grade 1 classroom assisted student learning of
   addition with teen totals by valuing students' informal knowledge and
   individual approaches, bridging the distance between their existing
   knowledge and the new culturally valued method, and giving carefully
   structured practice. The teacher decreased assistance over time but
   increased it for transitions to new problem types and for students who
   needed it. Students interacted, influenced/supported one another, and
   moved forward along their own learning paths within the Class Learning
   Path.},

Abstract = {We describe a four-level spectrum of pedagogical awareness (SPA) that
   emerged from the analysis of six undergraduate mathematics tutors' (1)
   conceptualizations of their first-year students' difficulties; (2)
   descriptive accounts of their strategies for facilitating the overcoming
   of these difficulties; and (3) self-reflective accounts regarding their
   teaching practices. These were recorded in 45 semistructured interviews
   conducted during the 8-week Oxford University term and following
   minimally participant observation of their tutorials. We exemplify the
   four levels of SPA, across these three strands, in 12 characteristic
   examples where tutors discuss episodes from the observed tutorials. The
   design and analysis of the study reflect three underlying theoretical
   perspectives: constructivist, sociocultural, and enactivist. Finally, we
   draw on participants' comments to suggest that our methodology
   encouraged reflection, raised awareness, and demonstrated the
   pedagogical potential of collaboration between mathematicians and
   mathematics educators. We see such awareness and collaborative goodwill
   as prerequisites to conceptualizing and implementing reform of
   pedagogical practice.},

Abstract = {The recent releases of two major international comparative studies that
   addressed mathematics-the Trends in International Mathematics and
   Science Study 2003 (TIMSS 2003) and the Program for International
   Student Assessment 2003 (PISA 2003)provide opportunities and challenges
   for mathematics education researchers interested in using the findings,
   instruments, and conceptual and theoretical perspectives of these
   studies as catalysts for secondary analysis and additional research. In
   particular, a number of important questions in mathematics education in
   the United States can be pursued, using various resources from these
   studies as a base, by mathematics education researchers and
   mathematicians collaborating with statisticians and assessment experts.
   We highlight some of the main findings of TIMSS 2003 and PISA 2003, and
   suggest how some of the instruments that were used in these studies, as
   well as the conceptual frameworks and priorities that guided them, might
   be beneficial in pursuing pressing questions in such areas as the role
   of curriculum in mathematics performance, the ways in which social
   contextual variables interact with mathematics learning, and the
   challenges in measuring the ability to use mathematics in real-world
   situations.},

Abstract = {Mathematics educators frequently recommend that students use strategies
   for measurement estimation, such as the reference point or benchmark
   strategy; however, little is known about the effects of using this
   strategy on estimation accuracy or representations of standard
   measurement units. One reason for the paucity of research in this area
   is that students rarely make use of this strategy spontaneously. In
   order to boost students' strategy use so that we could investigate the
   relationships among strategy use, accuracy of students' representations
   of standard measurement units, and estimation accuracy, 22 third-grade
   students received instruction on use of the reference point strategy and
   another 22 third-grade students received instruction on the
   guess-and-check procedure. Analyses reveal that children's strategy use
   predicts the accuracy of their representations of standard linear
   measurement units and their estimates. Relative to students who did not
   use a reference point, students who used a reference point had more
   accurate representations of standard units and estimates of length.},

Abstract = {Widespread agreement exists that U.S. teachers need improved mathematics
   knowledge for teaching. Over the past decade, policymakers have funded a
   range of professional development efforts designed to address this need.
   However, there has been little success in determining whether and when
   teachers develop mathematical knowledge from professional development,
   and if so, what features of professional development contribute to such
   teacher learning. This was due, in part, to a lack of measures of
   teachers' content knowledge for teaching mathematics. This article
   attempts to fill these gaps. In it we describe an effort to evaluate
   California's Mathematics Professional Development Institutes (MPDIs)
   using novel measures of knowledge for teaching mathematics. Our analyses
   showed that teachers participating in the MPDIs improved their
   performance on these measures during the extended summer workshop
   portion of their experience. This analysis also suggests that program
   length as measured in days in the summer workshop and workshop focus on
   mathematical analysis, reasoning, and communication predicted teachers'
   learning.},

Abstract = {Preschool children's understanding of the mathematical significance of

   about the number of larger objects versus the number of smaller objects
   that would fit in a container or bounded space. Children's judgments
   about effects of object size were elicited both before and after the
   presentation of a series of demonstration trials. The accuracy of
   children's judgments about the effects of object size improved
   significantly from pretest to posttest, and the degree of improvement
   was similar for 3-year-olds versus 4-year-olds and for Head Start
   children versus children who attended private preschools. The Head Start
   children, however, were much less likely than their peers attending
   private preschools to be able to articulate relevant quantitative
   features when asked to explain the outcomes that they observed during
   the training trials.},

Abstract = {In this article we demonstrate how research-based knowledge about
   students' incompatible solutions to various representations of the same
   problem could be used to raise their awareness of inconsistencies in
   their reasoning. In the first part of the article we report that
   students' decisions as to whether 2 given infinite sets have the same
   number of elements depend on the specific representation of the infinite
   sets in the problem. We used these findings to construct an infinite-set
   activity with the aim of encouraging students to reflect on their own
   thinking about infinity. The findings indicate that taking part in this
   activity led a number of the participating students to realize that
   producing 2 contradictory reactions to the same mathematical problem is
   problematic; yet, few chose to avoid these contradictions by using
   l-to-l correspondence as a criterion for comparing infinite sets.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the problem-posing abilities of third-grade
   children who displayed different profiles of achievement in number sense
   and novel problem solving. The study addressed (a) whether children
   recognize formal symbolism as representing a range of problem
   situations, (b) whether children generate a broader range of problem
   types for informal number situations, (c) how children from different
   achievement profiles respond to problem-posing activities in formal and
   informal contexts, and (d) whether children's participation in a
   problem-posing program leads to greater diversity in problems posed.
   Among the findings were children's difficulties in posing a range of
   problems in formal contexts, in contrast to informal contexts, Children
   from different achievement profiles displayed different response
   patterns, reflected in the balance of structural and operational
   complexity shown in their problems.},

Abstract = {Much of students' numeric mathematical activity can be interpreted as
   the construction and coordination of units. This article reports
   evidence of construction and coordination of units in a measurement
   setting, using data gathered from 4 students during individual
   problem-solving sessions near the end of their fourth-grade year and
   augmented through knowledge gained with these students in the previous 2
   years. Three students each developed different ways of solving the
   measurement task that reflected the construction and coordination of
   abstract units, whereas a fourth student did not. On the basis of this
   evidence we propose that the task of measuring 2-dimensional regions
   becomes possible when a student is able to construct iterable
   2-dimensional units and coordinate those units.},

Abstract = {Interviews were held with 107 children, aged 4 through 7, to ascertain
   their understanding of compensation and covariance in part-whole
   relationships. They were questioned about uncounted quantities, counted
   quantities, and numerical equations. The results showed that 4-year-old
   children could usually predict the effect of changes to one or more
   parts of an uncounted whole, but were less competent in predicting
   changes to counted quantities. The ability to predict changes to counted
   quantities and give reasons for the change increased with age. Some
   6-year-old children were able to give reasons for these relationships
   that went beyond direct observation. Only 7-year-old children were able
   to use covariance and compensation in a purely numerical context, that
   of derived equations. These results have implications for teaching young
   children.},

Abstract = {Part I of this report (Thompson gi Thompson, 1994) described the
   attempts of one teacher, Bill, to teach concepts of speed to one child,
   Ann. We analyzed sources of their eventual dysfunctional communication,
   concluding that Bill had encapsulated his deep understandings of rate
   and proportionality within his language for numbers and operations. Part
   II presents the session of the researcher, Pat, with Ann, analyzing his
   instructional actions in light of his agenda for having Ann build a
   scheme of operations by which to understand distance, time, and speed.
   We contrast Pat's agenda with Bill's, focusing on the mathematical
   knowledge that guided their instructional decisions and actions and
   briefly discuss implications for the preparation of teachers with regard
   to content knowledge.},

Abstract = {This Research Commentary addresses the need for an instrument
   abstract???termed an Interpretation and Use Statement (IUS)???to be
   included when mathematics educators present instruments for use by
   others in journal articles and other communication venues (e.g.,
   websites and administration manuals). We begin with presenting the need
   for IUSs, including the importance of a focus on interpretation and use.
   We then propose a set of elements???identified by a group of mathematics
   education researchers, instrument developers, and psychometricians???to
   be included in the IUS. We describe the development process, the
   recommended elements for inclusion, and two example IUSs. Last, we
   present why IUSs have the potential to benefit end users and the field
   of mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Elementary prospective school teachers (PSTs) often struggle to
   understand why they need to relearn the mathematics that they think they
   already know. In this set of replication studies, I address this
   struggle in 3 ways: First, by increasing and varying the participant
   pool, I replicate Thanheiser's (2009) study, which shows that PSTs do
   not yet understand number in a way that enables them to teach it.
   Second, I introduce, validate, and examine the effect of using a survey
   instead of interviews, thus changing the methods of the original study.
   Third, I move beyond Thanheiser's original study and show that an
   interview designed to help PSTs assess their own knowledge accurately
   correlates with more sophisticated conceptions at the end of the course.
   Based on these findings, I posit that such an interview could be used to
   help PSTs learn the mathematics that they need to teach.},

Abstract = {Gender research in mathematics education has experienced methodological
   and theoretical shifts over the past 45 years. Although achievement
   studies have used assessment tools to explore and subsequently challenge
   the assumption of male superiority on mathematics assessments, research
   on participation has unpacked these studies' sex-based achievement
   comparisons by exploring the masculinization of mathematics through
   qualitative methods. This article offers a review of gender research in
   mathematics education with analysis of its findings as well as
   conceptual and empirical contributions. Current understanding of
   mathematics as a gendered space, however, can be further broadened
   through intersectional analyses of gender and its interplay with other
   identities (e.g., race or ethnicity, class). Implications for future
   gender research, particularly the adoption of intersectionality theory,
   are raised to inform more nuanced analyses.},

Abstract = {We describe a case study in which we investigate the effectiveness of a
   lecture in advanced mathematics. We first videorecorded a lecture
   delivered by an experienced professor who had a reputation for being an
   outstanding instructor. Using video recall, we then interviewed the
   professor to determine the ideas that he intended to convey and how he
   tried to convey these ideas in this lecture. We also interviewed 6
   students to see what they understood from this lecture. The students did
   not comprehend the ideas that the professor cited as central to his
   lecture. Based on our analyses, we propose 2 factors to account for why
   students did not understand these ideas.},

Abstract = {This study concentrated on the theory practice problem in mathematics
   teacher education. We examined 13 student teachers' use of theory when
   they reflected on teaching practice in a class specifically designed to
   optimize the chance for theory use. We developed a Reflection Analysis
   Instrument with which the student teachers' use of theory could be
   identified univocally and described in a systematic way. We describe a
   case study that illustrates the nature and level of one student
   teacher's use of theory and discuss variations in all of the student
   teachers' reasoning and differences in their depth of theory use.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the development of length measurement ideas in
   students from prekindergarten through 2nd grade. The main purpose was to
   evaluate and elaborate the developmental progression, or levels of
   thinking, of a hypothesized learning trajectory for length measurement
   to ensure that the sequence of levels of thinking is consistent with
   observed behaviors of most young children. The findings generally
   validate the developmental progression, including the tasks and the
   mental actions on objects that define each level, with several
   elaborations of the levels of thinking and minor modifications of the
   levels themselves.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Volume = {41},

Pages = {147-168},

Abstract = {Selection bias is a problem for mathematics education researchers
   interested in using observational rather than experimental data to make
   causal inferences about the effects of different instructional methods
   in mathematics on Student outcomes. Propensity score methods represent a
   approach to dealing with such selection bias. This article describes
   general principles underlying propensity score methods and illustrates
   their application to mathematics education research using 2 examples
   investigating the impact of problem-solving emphasis in mathematics
   classrooms on Students' subsequent mathematics achievement and course
   taking. Limitations of the method are discussed.},

Abstract = {We examine student achievement of 2533 students in 10 middle schools in
   relation to the implementation of textbooks developed with funding from
   the National Science Foundation (NSF) or publisher-developed textbooks.
   Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), curriculum type was not a
   significant predictor of student achievement on the Balanced Assessment
   in Mathematics (BAM) or TerraNova Survey (TNS) after controlling for
   student-level variables. However, the Standards-Based Learning
   Environment (SBLE) moderated the effect of curriculum type. Students
   were positively impacted on the BAM by NSF-funded curricula when coupled
   with either Moderate or High levels of SBLE. There was no statistically
   significant impact of NSF-funded curricula on students in classrooms
   with a Low level of SBLE, and the relationship between
   publisher-developed textbooks and SBLE was not statistically
   significant. Moreover, there was no significant impact of either
   curriculum type when coupled with varying levels of SBLE on the TNS as
   the dependent measure.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate Gth-grade students' use of
   equations to describe and represent problem situations prior to formal
   instruction in algebra. Ten students were presented with a series of
   similar tasks in 6 different problem contexts representing linear and
   nonlinear situations. The students in this study showed a remarkable
   ability to generalize the problem situations and to write equations
   using variables, often in nonstandard form. Although students were often
   able to write equations, they rarely used their equations to solve
   related problems. We describe students' preinstructional uses of
   equations to generalize problem situations and raise questions about the
   most appropriate curriculum for building on students' intuitive
   knowledge of algebra.},

Abstract = {This study employed sociolinguistic perspectives developed by Michael
   Halliday to investigate the social context of 2 mathematics classrooms
   that differed in the socioeconomic backgrounds and genders of their
   students. Our analysis focused on the effects of these 2 factors on
   teacher perceptions of student needs and abilities and on how these
   perceptions shaped the discourse in the classroom. We argue that as
   mathematical knowledge is being constructed in the classroom, the
   student participants are being constructed by the teachers according to
   their ability in and need for different dialects of mathematics that
   have different values in our Western culture.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to document changes in U.S. mathematics
   achievement by reviewing national trend studies, college admissions
   examinations, and Advanced Placement tests. This article examined this
   quantitative research literature to determine trends in mathematics
   achievement of various social groups defined along lines of race, class,
   gender, ethnicity, and language proficiency. The findings of this review
   indicate that over the last 15 years all demographic groups have
   improved in mathematics achievement-specifically, in basic skills.
   Moreover,the mathematics achievement gap is slowly closing between White
   students and students of color on assessments of basic skills. Males
   tended to outperform females on standardized measures; however, gender
   differences were small and generally not significant. Consistent with
   past reviews of mathematics achievement, course taking was a powerful
   variable, often resulting in similar achievement gains across diverse
   groups. This finding has serious implications for equity-related policy.
   The article concludes with two other recommendations: the need for
   fiscal and cultural policy to support standards-based reform.},

Abstract = {This article investigates teachers' subject-matter knowledge and its
   interrelations with pedagogical content knowledge in the context of
   teaching the concept of function. During the first phase of data
   collection, 152 prospective secondary teachers completed an open-ended
   questionnaire concerning their knowledge about function. In the second
   phase, an additional 10 prospective teachers were interviewed after
   responding to the questionnaire. The analysis shows that many of the
   subjects did not have a modern conception of function. Appreciation of
   the arbitrary nature of functions was missing, and very few could
   explain the importance and origin of the univalence requirement. This
   limited conception of function influenced the subjects' pedagogical
   thinking. Therefore, when describing functions for students, many used
   their limited concept image and tended not to employ modem terms. In
   addition, many chose to provide students with a rule to be followed
   without concern for understanding.},

Abstract = {In this article we focus on two interrelated aspects of the Process of
   learning to teach mathematics for understanding: (a) ideas and practices
   for teaching procedural knowledge and (b) ideas and practices for
   teaching conceptual knowledge. We explore one student teacher's ideas
   and practices, together with the messages about teaching for procedural
   and conceptual knowledge that were presented by the teacher education
   program in which the student teacher was enrolled and the placement
   schools in which she student taught. We reveal a pattern in which the
   student teacher, her mathematics methods course instructor, her
   cooperating teachers, and the administrators of her placement schools
   expressed a variety of strong commitments to teaching for both
   procedural and conceptual knowledge; but with these commitments, the
   student teacher taught, learned to teach, and had opportunities to learn
   to teach for procedural knowledge more often and more consistently than
   she did for conceptual knowledge. We find that the actual teaching
   pattern (what was done) was the product of unresolved tensions within
   the student teacher, the other key actors in her environment, and the
   learning-to-teach environment itself. We hypothesize that situational
   supports constructed to emphasize more consistently teaching for
   conceptual knowledge might help resolve at least some of the tensions,
   and we suggest that such supports should be developed if the national
   goal to increase the teaching of mathematics for understanding is to be
   achieved.},

Abstract = {Responsiveness to students??? mathematical thinking is a characteristic
   of classroom discourse that reflects the extent to which students???
   mathematical ideas are present, attended to, and taken up as the basis
   for instruction. Using the Mathematically Responsive Interaction (MRI)
   Framework and data from 11 middle-grades classrooms, we illustrate
   varied enactments of responsiveness and describe fluctuations in and
   relationships among different components of responsiveness. We found
   positive associations between different components of responsiveness,
   but they were not entirely predictive of one another. Individual
   classrooms appeared more or less responsive depending on which component
   was foregrounded. Our findings offer a more comprehensive
   characterization of responsiveness that documents the intertwined nature
   of teacher moves and student contributions during all whole-class
   instruction.},

Abstract = {This research focuses on the retention of students' algebraic
   understandings 1 year following a 3-year early algebra intervention.
   Participants included 1,455 Grade 6 students who had taken part in a
   cluster randomized trial in Grades 3-5. The results show that, as was
   the case at the end of Grades 3, 4, and 5, treatment students
   significantly outperformed control students at the end of Grade 6 on a
   written assessment of algebraic understanding. However, treatment
   students experienced a significant decline and control students a
   significant increase in performance relative to their respective
   performance at the end of Grade 5. An item-by-item analysis performed
   within condition revealed the areas in which students in the two groups
   experienced a change in performance.},

Title = {``Bold Problem Solving{''}: A New Construct for Understanding Gender
   Differences in Mathematics},

Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {12-61},

Abstract = {Despite progress toward gender equity, troubling disparities in
   mathematical problem-solving performance and related outcomes persist.
   To investigate why, we build on recurrent findings in previous studies
   to introduce a new construct, ``bold problem solving,{''} which involves
   approaching mathematics problems in inventive ways. We introduce a
   self-report survey of bold problem-solving orientation and find that it
   mediates gender differences in problem-solving performance for both
   high-achieving middle school students (n = 79) and a more diverse sample
   of high school students (n = 222). Confidence mt./hates the relation
   between gender and bold problem-solving orientation, with mixed results
   for mental rotation skills and teacher-pleasing tendencies as mediators.
   Overall, the new bold problem-solving construct appears promising for
   advancing our understanding of gender differences in mathematics.},

Abstract = {Current reforms in geometry seek to challenge prevailing ideas about
   ``what it means to do mathematics{''} (Stephan et al., 2015, p. 139) by
   engaging learners in ``the grasping of space{''} (Freudenthal, 1973;
   Hansen et al., 1998, p. 241). This study takes up this challenge by
   investigating problematizing activity as an embodied phenomenon among 21
   eighth-grade learners who engaged with spatial and dimensional concepts
   during a series of investigations around Flatland. Using a
   phenomenological research approach, we examined classroom discourse as
   well as learners' blog postings, lived-experience descriptions, and
   interviews. The analysis revealed three manifestations of problematizing
   activity-provocation, impasse, and questioning and conjecturing
   activity. Embodiment was evidenced through perceptuo-motor-imaginary
   activity as learners juxtaposed naturally continuous space with discrete
   notions of space emphasized in K-12 settings.},

Abstract = {A major influence on mathematics teachers' instruction is their beliefs.
   However, teachers' instructional practices do not always neatly align
   with their beliefs because of factors perceived as constraints. The
   purpose of this article is to introduce a new approach for examining the
   relationship between teachers' beliefs and practices, an approach that
   focuses on specific instructional practices that support the development
   of students' conceptual understanding and on mismatches that occur
   between what teachers believe to be important and what they report
   actually doing in the classroom. We also examine the relationship
   between teachers' self-reported constraints and mismatches between
   teachers' beliefs and practices.},

Abstract = {We investigated how secondary mathematics teachers check student
   geometry proofs. From video records of geometry teachers checking
   proofs, we conjectured that teachers have different expectations for
   details that follow from written statements than for details that are
   conveyed by diagrams. To test our conjectures, we randomly assigned 44
   secondary mathematics teachers to 1 of 3 experiment groups (n = 13, n =
   15, n = 16) in which they viewed and rated representations of
   instructional practice. Participants in each group viewed treatment or
   control versions of instructional scenarios and rated the
   appropriateness of the teachers' work in different segments of each
   scenario. We compared participants' ratings across and within experiment
   groups. We found that participants rated lower instruction that deviated
   from what we hypothesized to be their expectations, confirming our
   hypotheses.},

Abstract = {The current study uses a large, nationally representative data set and a
   new method for computing teacher expectations to better understand the
   developmental effect of mathematics teacher expectations on future
   student achievement. The study utilizes autoregressive cross-lagged
   models with 5 time points between kindergarten and 8th grade as well as
   multigroup modeling to examine group differences in teacher expectancy
   effects on achievement for girls and minority students. Results indicate
   that students' experiences with teacher expectations from 1 time point
   to the next are not significantly associated with one another, but their
   association with future student achievement grows over time. Teacher
   expectancy effects in mathematics are stronger for White girls, minority
   girls, and minority boys than they are for White boys. Implications for
   teaching are discussed.},

Abstract = {In a previous study of 2 schools in England that taught mathematics very
   differently, the first author found that a project-based mathematics
   approach resulted in higher achievement, greater understanding, and more
   appreciation of mathematics than a traditional approach. In this
   follow-up study, the first author contacted and interviewed a group of
   adults 8 years after they had left the 2 schools to investigate their
   knowledge use in life. This showed that the young adults who had
   experienced the 2 mathematics teaching approaches developed profoundly
   different relationships with mathematics knowledge that contributed
   towards the shaping of different identities as learners and users of
   mathematics (Boaler \& Greeno, 2000). The adults from the project-based
   school had also moved into significantly more professional jobs, despite
   living in one of the lowest income areas of the country. In this
   article, we consider the different opportunities that the 2 school
   approaches offered for long-term relationships with mathematics and
   different forms of mathematical expertise that are differentially useful
   in the 21st century (Hatano \& Oura, 2003).},

Abstract = {This Research Commentary builds on a 2-stage literature review to argue
   that there are 4 obstacles to making a sociopolitical turn in
   mathematics education that would allow researchers to talk about race
   and ethnicity in ways that take both identity and power seriously. The
   obstacles discussed are (a) the marginalization of discussions of race
   and ethnicity; (b) the reiteration of race and ethnicity as independent
   variables; (c) absence of race and ethnicity from mathematics education
   research; and (d) the minimizing of discussions of race and ethnicity,
   even within equity-oriented work.},

Abstract = {This study investigates 3 preservice secondary mathematics teachers'
   understandings of limits of sequences and their changing conceptions of
   limit during and after instruction involving interactive, dynamic
   sketches embodying the formal definition of the limit of a sequence.
   Manipulating a coherent visual representation of the formal definition
   in the contexts of various sequences, coupled with answering carefully
   chosen questions and completing interview tasks before, during, and
   after technology-enhanced instruction, gave the participants
   opportunities to investigate and reflect on their own concept image as
   they compared their understandings to the results of the actions they
   performed on the sketch. The participants modified their conceptions of
   limit and strengthened their understandings of formal limit ideas as
   they integrated the visual representation with the symbolic definition.},

Abstract = {This article reports on students' learning through conjecturing, by
   drawing on a semester-long teaching experiment with 6 sixth-grade
   students. It focuses on I of the students, Josh, who developed
   especially powerful ways of operating over the course of the teaching
   experiment. Through a fine-grained analysis of Josh's actions, this
   article integrates Piaget's scheme theory (1950/2001) and Peirce's logic
   of abduction (1998) into a new theory about conjecturing that explains
   Josh's learning. Results indicate the power of Josh's operational
   conjectures in resolving problematic situations and constructing new
   schemes. Because of the context in which the teaching experiment and
   Josh's conjecturing occurred, results hold implications for research on
   fractions and on a particular operation called splitting (Confrey, 1994;
   Empson, 1999; Sdenz-Ludlow, 1994; Steffe, 2003). The theoretical
   integration of scheme theory and abduction also holds implications for
   resolving the learning paradox (Fodor, 1980; Glasersfeld, 2001).},

Abstract = {This article discusses the challenge of improving the interrelationships
   between research and practice in mathematics education, and it outlines
   actions being taking to respond to that challenge. The need for
   improvement is bidirectional. The practice of classroom mathematics
   teaching needs to be better informed by an understanding of the
   implications of existing bodies of research, and researchers need to
   learn more from the insights and knowledge of practitioners. Building on
   its series of initiatives designed to use research to guide mathematics
   teaching and learning, NCTM has made a new commitment to a flexible,
   nimble, and sustainable initiative that will strengthen the
   bidirectional link between research and practice. This initiative
   includes the development of Research Analyses, Briefs, and Clips (ABCs),
   research syntheses designed through collaboration of teacher leaders and
   researchers to inform instructional leaders and policy-makers about
   research perspectives on critical issues of practice.},

Title = {Metaphor and numerical diagrams in the arithmetical activity of a

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-56},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Fourth-grade students who participated in a yearlong, whole-class
   teaching experiment not only reconceptualized natural numbers but also
   generated flexible solution strategies to perform numerical computations
   mentally and in writing. Students' reconceptualization of number was
   mediated by their perceived resemblance between the physical action of
   splitting an object into parts and the mental action of splitting a
   number into units. Such a resemblance, evoked by the word split as used
   by the students, can be considered to be a metaphor in the Peircean
   theory of signs. This spontaneous metaphor mediated students'
   constructions of numerical strategies. Students communicated such
   strategies through different signs like numerical diagrams, verbal
   numerical arguments, and other idiosyncratic arithmetical notations.
   Students presented the same solution strategy using signs in different
   semiotic systems and translated signs in one system into signs of
   another system. Students' arithmetical activity indicated a shift from
   an instrumental understanding of basic arithmetic to a relational
   understanding mediated by their symbolic initiative. The article
   contains an analysis of the collective construction of this metaphor and
   its role in mediating the semiotic and arithmetical activity of the
   students.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of two low-performing students'
   experiences in a first-grade classroom oriented toward teaching
   mathematics for understanding. Combining constructs from interactional
   sociolinguistics and developmental task analysis, I investigate the
   nature of these students' participation in classroom discourse about
   fractions. Pre- and post-instruction interviews documenting learning and
   analysis of classroom interactions suggest mechanisms of that learning.
   I propose that three main factors account for these two students'
   success: use of tasks that elicited the students' prior understanding,
   creation of a variety of participant frameworks (Goffman, 1981) in which
   the students were treated as mathematically competent, and frequency of
   opportunities for identity-enhancing interactions.},

Abstract = {We investigate how expert nurses undertake the calculation of drug
   dosages on the ward, This calculation is error-critical in nursing
   practice and maps onto the concepts of ratio and proportion. Using
   episodes of actual drug administration gleaned from ethnographic study,
   we provide evidence that experienced nurses use a range of correct
   proportional-reasoning strategies based on the invariant of drug
   concentration to calculate dosage on the ward instead of the single
   taught method they describe outside of the practice. These strategies
   are fled to individual drugs, specific quantities and volumes of drugs,
   the way drugs are packaged, and the organization of clinical work.},

Abstract = {The focus of this article is the strategies young children use to solve
   rectangular covering tasks before they have been taught area
   measurement. One hundred fifteen children from Grades 1 to 4 were
   observed while they solved various array-based tasks, and their drawings
   were collected and analyzed. Children's solution strategies were
   classified into 5 developmental levels; we suggest that children
   sequentially learn 4 principles underlying rectangular covering. In the
   analysis we emphasize the importance of understanding the relation
   between the size of the unit and the dimensions of the rectangle in
   learning about rectangular covering, clarify the role of multiplication,
   and identify the significance of a relational understanding of length
   measurement. Implications for the learning of area measurement are
   addressed.},

Abstract = {This study examined changes in the beliefs and instruction of 21 primary
   grade teachers over a 4-year period in which the teachers participated
   in a CGI (Cognitively Guided Instruction) teacher development program
   that focused on helping the teachers understand the development of
   children's mathematical thinking by interacting with a specific
   research-based model. Over the 4 years, there were fundamental changes
   in the beliefs and instruction of 18 teachers such that the teachers'
   role evolved from demonstrating procedures to helping children build on
   their mathematical thinking by engaging them in a variety of
   problem-solving situations and encouraging them to talk about their
   mathematical thinking. Changes in the instruction of individual teachers
   were directly related to changes in their students' achievement. For
   every teacher, class achievement in concepts and problem solving was
   higher at the end of the study than at the beginning. In spite of the
   shift in emphasis from skills to concepts and problem solving, there was
   no overall change in computational performance. The findings suggest
   that developing an understanding of children's mathematical thinking can
   be a productive basis for helping teachers to make the fundamental
   changes called for in current reform recommendations.},

Abstract = {Classroom discourse and communication are issues central to current
   reform in mathematics education. For reform to happen in classrooms,
   teachers will have to teach from a conceptual curriculum. To do so they
   must be sensitive to children's thinking during instruction and shape
   their instructional actions accordingly-to ensure that children hear
   what they intend them to hear. This article examines how one teacher's
   way of knowing mathematics was reflected in the language he used in
   teaching concepts of rate to one student during a teaching experiment.
   The teacher's conceptualizations of rate, although strong and elaborate,
   were encapsulated in the language of numbers and operations, and this
   undermined his effort to help the student understand rates conceptually.
   We examine the teacher's language in light of his intentions and the
   student's interpretations of the tasks. We discuss implications for
   instruction that is based on a conceptual curriculum and is sensitive
   and responsive to children's thinking.},

Abstract = {This article describes a historical case study of E. J. Edmunds, a Black
   mathematics student and teacher in 19th-century New Orleans. Edmunds's
   career as a student and then teacher of mathematics, which stretched
   from the antebellum era through Reconstruction and into segregation, was
   filled with obstacles and indignities but also with improbable
   successes. Edmunds proved to be among the world's top mathematical
   talents in 1871 by passing the grueling admissions exam for France's
   ecole Polytechnique. The purpose of the present article is to examine
   the implications that this historically rare example of Black
   mathematical achievement in the 19th century has for metanarratives of
   Black obstacles and achievement in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {Teacher evaluation policies have been central to policy efforts to
   enhance teaching quality. At the same time, ambitious mathematics
   instruction has been emphasized by teacher education programs as well as
   by the Common Core State Standards. Drawing on observation and survey
   data from early-career teachers, this study examines how teachers'
   perceived pressure of teacher evaluation policies shape their ambitious
   mathematics instruction. We found that teachers who perceived a strong
   pressure of teacher evaluation on their instructional practices tended
   to move further away from enacting ambitious mathematics instruction.
   Moreover, the negative association between the pressure of teacher
   evaluation and ambitious instruction was stronger for teachers with a
   high level of mathematical knowledge for teaching.},

Abstract = {Normative discourse about probability requires shared meanings for
   disciplinary vocabulaty. Previous research indicates that students'
   meanings for probability vocabulary often differ from those of
   mathematicians, creating a need to attend to developing students' use of
   language. Current standards documents conflict in their recommendations
   about how this should occur. In the present study, we conducted
   microgenetic research to examine the vocabulary use of four students
   before, during, and after lessons from a cycle of design-based research
   attending to probability vocabulary. In characterizing students'
   normative and nonnormative uses of language, we draw implications for
   the design of curriculum, standards, and further research. Specifically,
   we illustrate the importance of attending to incrementality,
   multidimensionality, polysemy, interrelatedness, and heterogeneity to
   foster students' probability vocabulary development.},

Abstract = {Aiming to enhance understanding of visual obstacles inherent in
   two-dimensional (2-D) sketches used in high school spatial geometry
   instruction, we propose a measure of visual difficulty based on two
   attributes of the sketches: potentially misleading geometrical
   information (PMI) and potentially helpful geometrical information (PHI).
   The difficulty of 12 normatively oriented cube-related sketches was
   theoretically ranked according to their ratios, \#PHI/\#PMI. The ranking
   was compared to the actual visual difficulty as measured by the
   percentage of correct or desired comprehension, individual spatial
   ability, and study-time allocation. This procedure was repeated for
   unnormatively oriented sketches, obtained by vertically flipping the
   original sketches. In both cases, the findings substantiate \#PHI/\#PMI
   as an a priori measure of visual difficulty. Practical, theoretical, and
   methodological implications are inspected and discussed.},

Abstract = {We examine the effects of 3 interventions designed to support Grades 2-5
   children's growth in measuring rectangular regions in different ways. We
   employed the microgenetic method to observe and describe conceptual
   transitions and investigate how they may have been prompted by the
   interventions. We compared the interventions with respect to children's
   learning and then examined patterns in observable behaviors before and
   after transitions to more sophisticated levels of thinking according to
   a learning trajectory for area measurement. Our findings indicate that
   creating a complete record of the structure of the 2-dimensional
   array-by drawing organized rows and columns of equal-sized unit
   squares-best supported children in conceptualizing how units were built,
   organized, and coordinated, leading to improved performance.},

Abstract = {We identify and document 3 cognitive obstacles, 3 cognitive affordances,
   and 1 type of integer understanding that can function as either an
   obstacle or affordance for learners while they extend their numeric
   domains from whole numbers to include negative integers. In particular,
   we highlight 2 key subsets of integer reasoning: understanding or
   knowledge that may, initially, interfere with one's learning integers
   (which we call cognitive obstacles) and understanding or knowledge that
   may afford progress in understanding and operating with integers (which
   we call cognitive affordances). We analyzed historical mathematical
   writings related to integers as well as clinical interviews with
   children ages 6-10 to identify critical, persistent cognitive obstacles
   and powerful ways of thinking that may help learners to overcome
   obstacles.},

Abstract = {In an era when familiar categories of identity are breaking down, an
   argument is made for using post-structuralist vocabulary to talk about
   ethical practical action in mathematics education. Using aspects of
   Foucault's post-structuralism, an explanation is offered of how
   mathematical identifications are tied to the social organization of
   power. An analysis of 2 everyday instances is provided to capture the
   oppressive conditions in which ordinary people involved in mathematics
   are engaged. Describing how systemic constraints become lived as
   individual dilemmas offers a way of understanding what we might do to
   effect change, and what we might do to produce tangible results.},

Abstract = {Piagetian theory describes mathematical development as the construction
   and organization of mental operations within psychological structures.
   Research on student learning has identified the vital roles of two
   particular operations splitting and units coordination play in students'
   development of advanced fractions knowledge. Whereas Steffe and
   colleagues (e.g., Steffe, 2001; Steffe \& Olive, 2010) describe these
   knowledge structures in terms of fractions schemes, Piaget introduced
   the possibility of modeling students' psychological structures with
   formal mathematical structures, such as algebraic groups. This paper
   demonstrates the utility of modeling students' development with a
   structure that is isomorphic to the positive rational numbers under
   multiplication the splitting group. We use a quantitative analysis of
   written assessments from 58 eighth grade students to test hypotheses
   related to this development. Results affirm and refine an existing
   hypothetical learning trajectory for students' constructions of advanced
   fractions schemes by demonstrating that splitting is a necessary
   precursor to students' constructions of 3 levels of units coordination.},

Title = {An Interpretive Scheme for Analyzing the Identities That Students

Pages = {40-68},

Abstract = {Our primary purpose in this article is to propose an interpretive scheme
   for analyzing the identities that students develop in mathematics
   classrooms that can inform instructional design and teaching. We first
   introduce the key constructs of normative identity and personal
   identity, and then illustrate how they can be used to conduct empirical
   analyses. The case on which the sample analysis focuses concerns a
   single group of middle school students who were members of two
   contrasting classrooms in which what it meant to know and do mathematics
   differed significantly. The resulting analyses document the forms of
   agency that students can legitimately exercise in particular classrooms,
   together with how authority is distributed and thus to whom Students are
   accountable, and what they are accountable for mathematically. In the
   final section of the article, we clarify the relation of the
   interpretive scheme to other current work on the identities that
   students are developing in mathematics classrooms.},

Abstract = {Functions are all around us, disguised as actions on concrete objects.
   Composition of functions, too, is all around us, because these actions
   can be performed in succession, the output of one serving as the input
   for the next. In terms of Gray and Tall's (200 1) ``embodied objects{''}
   or Lakoff and Nunez's (2000) ``mathematical idea analysis,{''} this
   ``embodied scheme{''} of action on objects may serve as intuitive
   grounding for the function concept. However, as Gray, Tall, and their
   colleagues have shown, such embodied schemes can also lead to serious
   ``epistemological obstacles{''} in later stages of concept development.
   In the same vein, our own data show that the intuitions about change and
   invariance entailed by the action-on-objects scheme, although helpful in
   earlier stages of teaming functions, may later come to clash with the
   formal concepts of function and of composition of functions.},

Abstract = {Intensive case study is an expensive tool for measuring teachers'
   instructional practice. Previous research suggests that teacher
   self-report surveys provide a low-cost and relatively accurate picture
   of classroom practice. To examine the extent to which teachers implement
   mathematics education reform, we developed a 20-item survey based on
   nine dimensions of standards-based teaching. In this article, we provide
   evidence of the reliability (i.e., internal consistency) and validity of
   the instrument. The evidence consists of correlations of survey scores
   with a mandated performance assessment in Grade 6 mathematics,
   congruence with classroom observations of a small sample of teachers,
   and demonstrations that teachers who are similar in their claims about
   using a standards-based text series differ in how they use the text in
   ways predicted by the survey.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {176-203},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article uses a classroom episode in which a teacher and her
   students undertake a task of proving a proposition about angles as a
   context for analyzing what is involved in the teacher's work of engaging
   students in producing a proof. The analysis invokes theoretical notions
   of didactical contract and double bind to uncover and explain
   conflicting demands that the practice of assigning two-column proofs
   imposes on high school teachers. Two aspects of the work of
   teaching-what teachers do to create a task in which students can produce
   a proof and what teachers do to get students to prove a proposition-are
   the focus of the analysis of the episode. This analysis supports the
   argument that the traditional custom of engaging students in doing
   formal, two-column proofs places contradictory demands on the teacher
   regarding how the ideas for a proof will be developed. Recognizing these
   contradictory demands clarifies why the teacher in the analyzed episode
   ends up suggesting the key ideas for the proof. The analysis, coupled
   with current recommendations about the role of proof in school
   mathematics, suggests that it is advantageous for teachers to avoid
   treating proof only as a formal process.},

   of parents' and teachers' attitudes toward various strategies. Parents
   and teachers completed questionnaires about the types of strategy and
   metacognitive instruction they provided Previous results (Carr Sc
   Jessup, 1997) were replicated with boys correctly using retrieval during
   the Ist grade more than girls and girls correctly using overt strategies
   mon than boys. Boys were influenced by the belief that adults like
   strategies indicating ability and by teacher instruction on retrieval
   strategies. Girls' strategy use was not related to perceived adult
   beliefs or actions.},

Abstract = {Year-long classroom teaching experiments in two predominantly Latino
   low-socioeconomic-status (SES) urban classrooms (one English-speaking
   and one Spanish-speaking) sought to support first graders' thinking of
   2-digit quantities as tens and ones. A model of a developmental sequence
   of conceptual structures for 2-digit numbers (the UDSSI triad model) is
   presented to describe children's thinking. By the end of the year, most
   of the children could accurately add and subtract 2-digit numbers that
   require trading (regrouping) by using drawings or objects and gave
   answers by using tens and ones on various tasks. Their performance was
   substantially above that reported in other studies for U.S. first
   graders of higher SES and for older U.S. children. Their responses
   looked more like those of East Asian children than of U.S. children in
   other studies.},

Abstract = {This case-study research investigated changing teacher roles associated
   with two teachers' use of innovative mathematics materials at Grade 6.
   Using daily participant observation and regular interviews with the
   teachers and the project staff member responsible for providing
   in-school support, a picture emerged of changing teacher roles and of
   those factors influencing the process of change. One teacher
   demonstrated little change in either espoused beliefs or observed
   practice over the course of the study. The second teacher demonstrated
   increasing comfort with posing nonroutine problems to students and
   allowing them to struggle together toward a solution, without suggesting
   procedures by which the problems could be solved. He also increasingly
   provided structured opportunities for students' reflection on activities
   and learning. Major influences on this teacher's professional growth
   appeared to be the provision of the innovative materials and the daily
   opportunity to reflect on classroom events in conversations and
   interviews with the researcher.},

Abstract = {This paper sets forth a way of interpreting mathematics classrooms that
   aims to account for how students develop mathematical beliefs and values
   and, consequently, how they become intellectually autonomous in
   mathematics. To do so, we advance the notion of sociomathematical norms,
   that is, normative aspects of mathematical discussions that are specific
   to students' mathematical activity. The explication of sociomathematical
   norms extends our previous work on general classroom social norms that
   sustain inquiry-based discussion and argumentation. Episodes from a
   second-grade classroom where mathematics instruction generally followed
   an inquiry tradition are used to clarify the processes by which
   sociomathematical norms are interactively constituted and to illustrate
   how these norms regulate mathematical argumentation and influence
   learning opportunities for both the students and the teacher, In doing
   so, we both clarify how students develop a mathematical disposition and
   account for students' development of increasing intellectual autonomy in
   mathematics. In the process, the teacher's role as a representative of
   the mathematical community is elaborated.},

   capitalize on the potential of errors to stimulate and support

   identifies some important variations within the strategy, and discusses

Abstract = {This article reports on the achievement and attitude aspects of a study
   comparing students who had the first 4 years of the University of
   Chicago School Mathematics Project (UCSMP) secondary curriculum to two
   distinct groups of comparable students, an age cohort and a mathematics
   course level cohort. A case study design with schools in three different
   sites (one urban, two suburban) was used. Three instruments were given:
   a Mathematics Level I Achievement Test from the Educational Testing
   Service, a 30-item Applications Test, and a 25-item Student Opinion
   Survey. At two of the sites, the UCSMP students outperformed both the
   age and course level cohorts by substantial amounts on both the
   achievement and application tests. At the third site, both comparison
   cohorts outperformed the UCSMP students on the achievement test, but
   results on the application test were mixed. At all three sites, there
   was little difference in the attitude items except on items concerning
   calculator use.},

Abstract = {Although NCTM's Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School
   Mathematics (1989) and Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics
   (1991) are generating considerable interest, there has been little
   discussion of their ideological and social grounding and effects.  By
   placing the Standards within the growing conservative movement in
   education, this paper raises a number of crucial issues about the
   documents, including the depth of the financial crisis in education and
   its economic and ideological genesis and results; the nature of
   inequality in schools the role of mathematical knowledge in our economy
   in maintaining these inequalities; the possibilities and limitations of
   a mathematics curriculum that is more grounded in students' experiences;
   and the complicated realities of teachers' lives.  Without a deeper
   under standing of these issues, the Standards will be used in ways that
   largely lend support only to the conservative agenda for educational
   reform.},

Abstract = {One of the challenges of understanding the complexity of so-called
   reform mathematics instruction lies in the observational tools used to
   capture it. This article introduces a unique tool, drawing from
   commognitive theory, for describing classroom discussions. The
   Realization Tree Assessment tool provides an image of a classroom
   discussion, depicting the realizations of the mathematical object
   manifested during the discussion and the narratives that articulate the
   links between these realizations. We applied the tool to 34 classroom
   discussions about a growing-pattern algebraic task and, through cluster
   analysis, found three types of whole-class discussion. Associations with
   classroom-level variables (track, but not grade level or teacher
   seniority) were also found. Implications with respect to applications
   and usefulness of the tool are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article addresses why instructors choose to not use
   inquiry-oriented instructional practices (IO-IPs) even if they believe
   the practices are beneficial. A national sample of undergraduate
   mathematics instructors (N = 269) responded to questionnaires on their
   use of IO-IPs, beliefs on student learning, and recognition of
   professional obligations???their responsibilities toward various
   stakeholders including the individual student, mathematics as a
   discipline, the institution, and society (Herbst \& Chazan, 2012).
   Structural equation modeling indicates that learner-focused beliefs
   often predict the use of IO-IPs, but that recognition of some
   professional obligations can work in opposition to those beliefs. Future
   work advocating for instructional change could use this framework to
   provide instructors with resources that leverage their existing
   priorities.},

Abstract = {In their commentary, ``Toward a Framework for Research Linking Equitable
   Teaching with the Standards for Mathematical Practice,{''} Bartell et
   al. (2017) provide a stepping-stone into the challenge of clarifying the
   interface between equity and standards setting in mathematics education
   by devising a framework that relates the Common Core State Standards for
   Mathematics to an explicit articulation of equitable teaching practices.
   In this commentary, we respond to this proposed framework and aim to
   clarify some key elements. Furthermore, we draw on our own positionings
   and scholarly interests to critique and bolster the framework by
   focusing on the tensions related to co-opting the Common Core for
   equity-oriented purposes, the framework's relationship to neoliberalism,
   and the role of racialized rhetoric and nondominant family and community
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {Past experiences as mathematics learners play a critical role in the way
   mathematics teachers consider what it means to know, do, and teach
   mathematics. Thus, understanding past experiences and ways to work with
   them in teacher education is a critical concern. Using phenomenological
   inquiry, we investigated moments of shift that occur along one's
   mathematics journey. The study draws on 30 prospective teachers'
   experiences in the form of lived-experience writing and interview data.
   Findings show that prospective teachers' shifts manifest in relations
   with others, across different time frames, and through material
   relations with mathematics. Most salient was the tentative and mutable
   nature of shifts, showing that shift might be better viewed as a
   possibility rather than a single event.},

   to consider research paradigms that could bring us closer to the new
   world we have envisioned where research is intertwined with practice. We
   will call the paradigms we have in mind research pathways to avoid the
   range of complicated connotations often applied to the term paradigm. By
   research pathways in education, we mean the collection of assumptions
   that define the purposes of educational research, the principles that
   differentiate research from other educational activities, and the
   guidelines for how research should be conducted.},

Abstract = {Persistent disconnects within and among education research, practice,
   and policy are limiting the reach of professional mathematics teacher
   communities, one of the most promising levers for humanizing mathematics
   teaching and learning in schools. An overarching goal of this commentary
   is to convince the field of mathematics education to broaden our
   research agendas beyond individual classrooms to teacher collectives so
   that our combined efforts have a greater positive impact on how people
   experience mathematics in and out of school. The commentary begins with
   a focused review of extant literature on teacher community to establish
   context, clarify theoretical underpinnings, and describe three important
   problems of teacher community. The need for research on these problems
   is connected to the need for studies of mathematics teacher learning to
   better specify what counts as evidence of learning and how this evidence
   gets analyzed. In response, and for the sake of epistemological and
   ontological transparency, teacher learning is theorized from a
   community-of-practice perspective. A frame analysis methodology for
   empirical analysis of collaborative mathematics teacher learning within
   professional teacher community contexts is theorized, thereby
   contributing provisional tools for the field to use in this work.},

Title = {Robust and Fragile Mathematical Identities: A Framework for Exploring
   Racialized Experiences and High Achievement Among Black College Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {46},
Number = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {I introduce the construct of fragile and robust identities for the
   purpose of exploring the experiences that influenced the mathematical
   and racial identities of high-achieving Black college students in
   mathematics and engineering. These students maintained high levels of
   academic achievement in these fields while enduring marginalization,
   stereotyping, and other forms of racialization. Their fragile
   mathematical identities were manifested in the way they were motivated
   to achieve in order to prove false the negative expectations of others.
   Their robust mathematical identities were characterized by an evolving
   sense of self-efficacy and discovery, a growing affinity and passion for
   mathematics, and a desire to be a mathematically inspiring role model.
   Extending the work on identity development, I recommend more nuanced
   interpretations of the interplay of human development, racialized
   experiences, and distinctly race-related risk and protective factors
   that complicate mathematical identity formation for Black college
   students in mathematics and engineering fields.},

Abstract = {Geometry diagrams use the visual features of specific drawn objects to
   convey meaning about generic mathematical entities. We examine the
   semiotic structure of these visual features in two parts. One, we
   conduct a semiotic inquiry to conceptualize geometry diagrams as
   mathematical texts that comprise choices from different semiotic
   systems. Two, we use the semiotic catalog that results from this inquiry
   to analyze 2,300 diagrams from 22 high school geometry textbooks in
   which the dates of publication span the 20th century. In the first part
   of the article, we identify axes along which the features of geometry
   diagrams can vary, and in the second part of the article, we show the
   viability of using the semiotic framework to conduct empirical studies
   of diagrams in geometry textbooks.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present a mathematical analysis that distinguishes
   two distinct quantitative perspectives on ratios and proportional
   relationships: variable number of fixed quantities and fixed numbers of
   variable parts. This parallels the distinction between measurement and
   partitive meanings for division and between two meanings for
   multiplication one rooted in counting equal-sized groups, the other in
   scaling the size of the groups. We argue that (a) the distinction in
   perspectives is independent from other distinctions in the literature on
   proportional relationships, including the within measure space versus
   between measure space ratio distinction; (b) the psychological roots for
   multiplication suggest the accessibility of the two perspectives to
   learners; and (c) the fixed numbers of variable parts perspective,
   though largely overlooked in past research, may provide an important
   foundation for central topics that build on proportional relationships.
   We also suggest directions for future empirical research.},

Abstract = {This article explores how issues of power and identity play out in
   mathematical practices and offers a perspective on how we might better
   understand the sociopolitical nature of teaching and learning
   mathematics. We present data from studies of mathematics teaching and
   learning in out-of-school settings, offering a sociocultural, then a
   sociopolitical analysis (attending to race, identity, and power), noting
   the value of the latter. In doing so, we develop a set of theoretical
   tools that move us from the sociocultural to the sociopolitical in
   studies of mathematics teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {Piaget (1971) made a distinction between intuitive (preoperational) time
   and operational (logico-mathematical) time. According to Piaget,
   operational time develops around 7-8 years of age and is characterized
   by children's ability to deduce, for example, that if A was born before
   B,A will always be older than B. When time is still intuitive, children
   base their judgments of age on what is observable (e.g., people's
   height). With the aid of I I pictures of an apple tree and a pear tree
   taken on 6 consecutive birthdays, 184 children in grades K-5 were
   individually asked, at a specific time, if two trees were the same age
   or if one was older than the other. Operational time was demonstrated by
   79\% of these children by grade 3.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use data from a large-scale Brazilian national
   assessment to discuss the relation between reform teaching and equity in
   mathematics education. We study the dimensionality of teaching style to
   better qualify what reform teaching means. We then use hierarchical
   linear models to explore whether reform teaching is associated with
   student achievement in mathematics and with student socioeconomic status
   (SES). Our results indicate that reform and traditional teaching are not
   opposite sides of a one-dimensional axis. They also emphasize both that
   reform teaching is related to higher school average achievement in
   mathematics and that the dissemination of reform teaching contributes to
   minimize the achievement gap between students who attend schools with
   low average SES and students who attend schools with high average SES.
   However, our results also show that reform is associated with an
   increase in within-school inequality in the social distribution of
   achievement.},

Abstract = {In their response to my (1996) article, Steffe and Thompson argued that
   I have taken an early position of Vygotsky's and that his later work is
   subsumed in and developed by von Glasersfeld. I argue that the two
   theories, Vygotsky's and radical constructivism, are, on the contrary,
   quite distinct and that this distinction, when seen as a dichotomy, is
   productive. I suggest that radical constructivists draw on a weak image
   of the role of social life. I argue that a thick notion of social leads
   to a complexity of sociocultural theories concerning the teaching and
   learning of mathematics, a perspective that is firmly located in the
   debates surrounding cultural theory of the last 2 decades.},

Abstract = {In this study we evaluated the thinking of 3rd-grade students in
   relation to an instructional program in probability. The instructional
   program was informed by a research-based framework that included a
   description of students' probabilistic thinking. Both an early- and a
   delayed-instruction group participated in the program. Qualitative
   evidence from 4 target students revealed that overcoming a misconception
   in sample space, applying both part-part and part-whole reasoning, and
   using invented language to describe probabilities were key patterns in
   producing growth in probabilistic thinking. Moreover, 51\% of the
   students exhibited the latter 2 learning patterns by the end of
   instruction, and both groups displayed significant growth in
   probabilistic thinking following the intervention.},

   problems. The study provides an existence proof that children can invent
   strategies for adding and subtracting and illustrates both what that
   invention affords and the role that different concepts may play in that
   invention. About 90\% of the students used invented strategies. Students
   who used invented strategies before they learned standard algorithms
   demonstrated better knowledge of base-ten number concepts and were more
   successful in extending their knowledge to new situations than were
   students who initially learned standard algorithms.},

   and 8 scoring in the upper and middle quintiles on the mental
   computation test was interviewed to identify strategies used to mentally
   compute.  All data were collected during the last month of the school
   year.  A wide range of performance on mental computation was found with
   respect to all types of numbers (whole numbers, decimals, and fractions)
   and operations at every grade level; the mode of presentation (visual or
   oral) significantly affected performance levels, with visual items
   generally producing higher performance; and the range of strategies
   (initial and alternative) used to do mental computation was narrow, with
   the most popular approach reflecting a mental version of a learned
   `'paper/pencil'' algorithm.},

Abstract = {Whenever the need arises to describe a set of data in a succinct way,
   the issue of mathematical representativeness arises.  The goal of this
   research is to understand the characteristics of fourth through eighth
   graders' constructions of `'average'' as a representative number
   summarizing a data set.  Twenty-one students were interviewed, using a
   series of open-ended problems that called on children to construct their
   own notion of representativeness.  Five basic constructions of
   representativeness are identified and analyzed.  These approaches
   illustrate the ways in which students are (or are not) developing
   useful, general definitions for the statistical concept of average.},

Abstract = {In this Research Commentary, we address a call to translate qualitative
   educational research into practice by highlighting the poten-tial of the
   qualitative synthesis methodology, which thus far has had limited
   guidelines and exemplars in mathematics education research. We
   contribute methodological guidance on one qualitative synthesis
   approach, meta-aggregation, by sharing experiences and lessons learned
   from using this approach in mathematics education. We discuss how and
   why researchers can normalize the use of this synthesis approach to
   influence policies and practices in mathematics teaching and learning.
   By sharing our experiences and insights on meta-aggregation components,
   we aim to support and motivate future development and application of
   qualitative synthesis in mathematics education research.},

Abstract = {This Research Commentary responds to the March 2022 issue of JRME. To
   discuss the four articles in the issue across their diverse approaches
   to equity, the authors propose a socio-ecological framework for mapping
   research in mathematics education. The framework focuses on the layers
   of social activity that each study addresses, both analytically and with
   respect to implications. Using their analysis of the articles in the
   issue, the authors identify strengths in mathematics education research

Abstract = {Recent international studies have found that teachers' attitudes, biased
   against historically marginalized groups, predict lower student
   achievement in mathematics (e.g., van den Bergh et al., 2010). It is not
   clear, however, if or how teachers' racial attitudes affect their
   evaluation of students' mathematical thinking to produce these effects.
   Using an experimental design, we conducted an online survey to examine
   the relationship between preservice teachers' (PSTs) racial attitudes
   and their perceptions of students' mathematical thinking. The survey
   used comparable videos, with similar mathematics content and student
   thinking, one including Black students and the other, White students.
   Findings show that PSTs evaluated Black students' thinking less
   favorably compared with White students. Explicit, but not implicit,
   attitudes, as well as reported time spent in African American
   communities, were factors in how PSTs rated the quality of students'
   mathematical thinking by race.},

Abstract = {Research focused on learning mathematics in a 2nd language is generally
   located in individual 2nd-language contexts. In this ethnographic study,
   I investigated mathematics learning in 4 different second-language
   contexts: a mainstream classroom, a sheltered classroom for Indigenous
   students, a welcome class for new immigrants, and a French-immersion
   classroom. The study was framed by a view of learning as socialization
   and the Bakhtinian notion of centripetal and centrifugal language
   forces. I present 7 socialization events that were particularly salient
   in 1 or more of the classrooms. For each socialization event, I identify
   various socialization practices. Based on a comparison of socialization
   practices in the 4 classrooms, I propose a distinction between language
   positive and language neutral mathematics classrooms. In language
   positive mathematics classrooms, students' socialization into
   mathematics and language includes explicit attention to different
   aspects of language use in mathematics. In language neutral mathematics
   classrooms, the role of language in mathematics tends to be implicit.},

Abstract = {This study examined the genre of undergraduate mathematical proof
   writing by asking mathematicians and undergraduate students to read 7
   partial proofs and identify and discuss uses of mathematical language
   that were out of the ordinary with respect to what they considered
   conventional mathematical proof writing. Three main themes emerged:
   First, mathematicians believed that mathematical language should obey
   the conventions of academic language, whereas students were either
   unaware of these conventions or unaware that these conventions applied
   to proof writing. Second, students did not fully understand the nuances
   involved in how mathematicians introduce objects in proofs. Third,
   mathematicians focused on the context of the proof to decide how formal
   a proof should be, whereas students did not seem to be aware of the
   importance of this factor.},

Abstract = {The field of mathematics education research has seen a resurgence of
   interest in understanding collaborative learning because students in
   K-12 classrooms are increasingly expected to make sense of mathematics
   problems together. This research commentary argues for the importance of
   understanding student authority relations in collaborative mathematics
   classrooms. How intellectual authority becomes constructed, organized,
   and distributed among students has implications for both mathematics
   learning and the development of mathematics-linked identities. This
   research commentary suggests directions for future work to gain clarity
   on the mechanisms that undergird the distribution of authority in order
   to support powerful mathematics classrooms.},

Abstract = {The implementation of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics
   (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices \& Council of
   Chief State School Officers, 2010) has the potential to move forward key
   features of standards-based reforms in mathematics that have been
   promoted in the United States for more than 2 decades (e.g., National
   Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989,2000; National Science
   Foundation, 1996). We believe that this is an especially opportune time
   to purposely focus on improving the mathematics education of students
   who have historically been denied access to a high-quality and rigorous
   mathematics education in the United States, specifically low-income
   students and students of color (e.g., Kitchen, DePree,
   Celedon-Pattichis, \& Brinkerhoff, 2007; Leonard \& Martin, 2013). We
   discuss a challenge to realizing standards-based reforms in mathematics
   in the United States: computer-based interventions in mathematics
   classrooms.},

Abstract = {In many STEM-related fields, graduating doctoral students are often
   expected to assume a postdoctoral position as a prerequisite to a
   faculty position, yet there is no such expectation in mathematics
   education. This phenomenon is likely due in large part to an abundance
   of faculty positions; however, it may also result from the field's
   perspective on postdoctoral positions. In this commentary, we call on
   the mathematics education research community to consider the importance
   of postdoctoral fellows, and we make the case that prioritizing
   postdoctoral positions could afford mutual benefits to the postdocs, to
   faculty mentors, and to the field at large.},

Abstract = {The central goals of most introductory linear algebra courses are to
   develop students' proficiency with matrix techniques, to promote their
   understanding of key concepts, and to increase their ability to make
   connections between concepts. In this article, we present an innovative
   method using adjacency matrices to analyze students' interpretation of
   and connections between concepts. Three cases provide examples that
   illustrate the usefulness of this approach for comparing differences in
   the structure of the connections, as exhibited in what we refer to as
   dense, sparse, and hub adjacency matrices. We also make use of
   mathematical constructs from digraph theory, such as walks and being
   strongly connected, to indicate possible chains of connections and
   flexibility in making connections within and between concepts. We posit
   that this method is useful for characterizing student connections in
   other content areas and grade levels.},

Abstract = {This article describes how teachers in a professional development course
   responded to what they noticed about children's participation in
   elementary mathematics classrooms and how what they noticed was
   connected to the teachers' positionality toward equitable mathematics
   pedagogy. The study connects scholarship in teacher noticing about
   children's mathematical thinking to scholarship in equity and
   mathematics teacher education. Data from teacher reflections on
   classroom video were analyzed to identify how teachers attended to,
   interpreted, and responded to what they noticed about children's
   participation. Findings suggest that a lens of participation supported
   teachers as they considered how to provide more equitable mathematics
   instruction. Further, the depth to which teachers noticed children's
   participation was connected to their positionality as equitable
   mathematics educators.},

Abstract = {Researchers have recently used traditional item response theory (IRT)
   models to measure mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT). Some
   studies (e.g., Hill, 2007; Izsak, Orrill, Cohen, \& Brown, 2010),
   however, have reported subgroups when measuring middle-grades teachers'
   MKT, and such groups violate a key assumption of IRT models. This study
   investigated the utility of an alternative called the mixture Rasch
   model that allows for subgroups. The model was applied to middle-grades
   teachers' performance on pretests and posttests bracketing a 42-hour
   professional development course focused on drawn models for fraction
   arithmetic. Results from psychometric modeling and evidence from
   video-recorded interviews and professional development sessions
   suggested that there were 2 subgroups of middle-grades teachers, 1
   better able to reason with 3-level unit structures and 1 constrained to
   2-level unit structures. Some teachers, however, were easier to classify
   than others.},

   might come to understand the limit concept. Drawing on a retrospective
   analysis of 2 teaching experiments, we propose 2 theoretical constructs
   to account for the students' success in formulating and understanding a
   definition of limit. The 1st construct relates to the need for students
   to move away from their tendency to attend first to the input variable
   of the function. The 2nd construct relates to the need for students to
   overcome the practical impossibility of completing an infinite process.
   Together, these 2 theoretical constructs build on Cottrill et al.'s
   work, resulting in a revised conceptual framework of limit.},

Abstract = {Prior research on students' uses of technology in the context of
   Euclidean geometry has suggested it can be used to support students'
   development of formal justifications and proofs. This study examined the
   ways in which students used a dynamic geometry tool, NonEuclid, as they
   constructed arguments about geometric objects and relationships in
   hyperbolic geometry. Eight students enrolled in a college geometry
   course participated in a task-based interview that was focused on
   examining properties of quadrilaterals in the Poincare disk model.
   Toulmin's argumentation model was used to analyze the nature of the
   arguments students provided when they had access to technology while
   solving the problems. Three themes related to the structure of students'
   arguments were identified. These involved the explicitness of warrants
   provided, uses of technology, and types of tasks.},

Abstract = {This article centers on studying the progress of algebraic syntax once
   students have surmounted initial obstacles found in the transition
   toward symbolic algebra. It specifically analyzes students' progress
   concerning the operation on the unknown, when the latter is represented
   by an expression that involves a 2nd unknown. In curricular terms,
   students face such a situation when they learn the classic methods to
   solve systems involving 2 linear equations with 2 unknowns. Results from
   this empirical study show that extending previous algebraic syntax to
   the 2nd tier of representation of the unknown requires fundamental
   reconceptualizations Such as that of algebraic equalization and that of
   mathematical unknown.},

Abstract = {A substantial amount of research in mathematics education seeks to
   document disparities in achievement between middle-class White students
   and students who are Black, Latina/Latino, First Nations, English
   language learners, or working class. I outline the dangers in
   maintaining an achievement-gap focus. These dangers include offering
   little more,than a static picture of inequities, supporting deficit
   thinking and negative narratives about students of color and
   working-class students, perpetuating the myth that the problem (and
   therefore solution) is a technical one, and promoting a narrow
   definition of learning and equity. I propose a new focus for research on
   advancement (excellence and gains) and interventions for specific

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Recent reform efforts call on secondary school mathematics teachers to
   provide all students with rich opportunities and experiences with proof
   throughout the secondary school mathematics curriculum-opportunities and
   experiences that reflect the nature and role of proof in the discipline
   of mathematics. teachers' success in responding to this call, however,
   depends largely on their own conceptions of proof This study examined 16
   in-service secondary school mathematics teachers' conceptions of proof.
   Data were gathered from a series of interviews and teachers' written
   responses to researcher-designed tasks focusing on proof. The results of
   this study suggest that teachers recognize the variety of roles that
   proof plays in mathematics; noticeably absent, however, was a view of
   proof as a tool for learning mathematics. The results also suggest that
   many of the teachers hold limited views of the nature of proof in
   mathematics and demonstrated inadequate understandings of what
   constitutes proof.},

Abstract = {In this study we investigate the content conceptions of an experienced
   high school mathematics teacher and link those conceptions to their role
   in the teacher's first implementation of reform-oriented curricular
   materials during a 6-week unit on functions. The teacher communicated
   deep and integrated conceptions of functions, dominated by graphical
   representations and covariation notions. These themes played crucial
   roles in the teacher's practice when he emphasized the use of multiple
   representations to understand dependence patterns in data. The teacher's
   well-articulated ideas about features of a variety of relationships in
   different representations supported meaningful discussions with students
   during the implementation of an unfamiliar classroom approach to
   functions.},

Abstract = {In this study, an intuitive model was defined as an internal mental
   structure corresponding to a class of calculation strategies. A sample
   of female students was observed 4 times during Grades 2 and 3 as they
   solved the same set of 24 word problems. From the correct responses, 12
   distinct calculation strategies were identified and grouped into
   categories from which the children's intuitive models of multiplication
   and division were inferred. It was found that the students used 3 main
   intuitive models: direct counting, repeated addition, and multiplicative
   operation. A fourth model, repeated subtraction, only occurred in
   division problems. All the intuitive models were used with all semantic
   structures, their frequency varying as a complex interaction of age,
   size of numbers, language, and semantic structure. The results are
   interpreted as showing that children acquire an expanding repertoire of
   intuitive models and that the model they employ to solve any particular
   problem reflects the mathematical structure they impose on it.},

Abstract = {This longitudinal case study presents a sequence of episodes that
   document the mathematical thinking of one child, Stephanie, over a
   5-year period. Her development of the idea of mathematical justification
   spans grades 1-5. Stephanie worked on several combinatorics tasks in
   small-group, whole-class, and individual interview settings. The
   documented events indicate Stephanie's progress in classifying,
   organizing, and reorganizing data. The study provides some significant
   insight into the process by which Stephanie learned to make proofs,
   within a setting that encouraged the development of her ideas.},

Abstract = {The study investigated the strategies that 7- to 12-year-old children
   spontaneously apply to the solution of novel combinatorial problems. The
   children were individually administered a set of six problems involving
   the dressing of toy bears in all possible combinations of tops and pants
   (two-dimensional) or tops, pants, and tennis rackets
   (three-dimensional). Two sets of solution procedures were identified,
   each comprising a series of five increasingly complex strategies ranging
   from trial-and-error approaches to sophisticated odometer procedures.
   Results suggested that experience with the two-dimensional problems
   enabled children to adopt and subsequently transform their efficient 2-D
   odometer strategy (where one item is held constant) into the most
   sophisticated 3-D odometer strategy, which involved working
   simultaneously with two constant items. The study highlights the
   importance of discrete mathematics as a source of problem-solving
   activities in which children are motivated to create, modify, and extend
   their own theories.},

Abstract = {Research has demonstrated that textbooks exert a considerable influence
   on students' learning opportunities and that technology has the
   potential to transform mathematics instruction. This brief report
   provides a systematic analysis of how technology tasks arc integrated
   into secondary mathematics curricula by analyzing a sample of 20
   textbooks. The results indicate that across the entire sample, nearly
   15\% of tasks incorporated technology, and of those, 21\% used it as a
   reorganizer of students' mathematical thinking; calculators were the
   predominant technology utilized. Investigative textbooks were not more
   likely to incorporate technology than conventional texts, but algebra 2
   texts were more likely to include technology than geometry texts.
   Implications for instruction and teacher preparation are discussed.},

Abstract = {Mathematics classrooms are increasingly becoming sites for investigating
   social (in)justice, but research on teaching mathematics for social
   justice remains limited to individual case studies. This article reports
   on a metasynthesis of 35 qualitative reports of social justice
   mathematics enactments in diverse classroom contexts. Critical race
   theory serves as a guiding framework for analyzing possibilities and
   limitations of these enactments to address racial inequities in
   mathematics education. Findings from this metasynthesis reveal that
   addressing race in social justice mathematics explorations provided
   opportunities for centering the voices of people of Color and critiquing
   liberal views that camouflage subtle forms of racism and involved
   substantial and authentic mathematical work. Promising practices and
   implications for future research are identified based on this synthesis.},

Abstract = {Although approximately 5-8\% of students have a mathematical learning
   disability (MLD), researchers have yet to develop a consensus
   operational definition. To examine how MLD has been identified and what
   mathematics topics have been explored, we conducted a systematic review
   of 164 studies on MLD published between 1974 and 2013. Findings indicate
   that (a) there was great variability in the classification methods used,
   (b) studies rarely reported demographic differences between the MLD and
   typically achieving groups, and (c) studies overwhelmingly focused on
   elementary-aged students engaged in basic arithmetic calculation. To
   move the field toward a more precise and shared definition of MLD, we
   argue for standards for methodology and reporting, and we identify a
   need for research addressing more complex mathematics.},

Abstract = {The study of functions is a critical route into teaching and learning
   algebra in the elementary grades, yet important questions remain
   regarding the nature of young children's understanding of functions.
   This article reports an empirically developed learning trajectory in
   first-grade children's (6-year-olds') thinking about generalizing
   functional relationships. We employed design research and analyzed data
   qualitatively to characterize the levels of sophistication in children's
   thinking about functional relationships. Findings suggest that children
   can learn to think in quite sophisticated and generalized ways about
   relationships in function data, thus challenging the typical curricular
   approach in the lower elementary grades in which children consider only
   variation in a single sequence of values.},

Abstract = {This study is a longitudinal look at the different mathematics placement
   profiles of Black students and White students from late elementary
   school through 8th grade. In particular, this study utilizes the Early
   Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K)
   data set to analyze the impact of teacher evaluation of student
   performance versus student demonstrated performance on the odds of being
   placed into algebra in the 8th grade. Results revealed that Black
   students had reduced odds of being placed in algebra by the time they
   entered 8th grade even after controlling for performance in mathematics.
   In addition, teacher evaluations of student performance were shown to
   play a greater role, albeit adversely, for Black students than for their
   peers. These results are discussed in terms of both implicit theory
   research and critical race theory. An important implication of this
   study is that placement recommendations must be monitored to ensure
   high-achieving students are placed appropriately, regardless of racial
   background.},

Abstract = {We examined curricular effectiveness in high schools that offered
   parallel paths in which students were free to study mathematics using 1
   of 2 content organizational structures, an integrated approach or a
   (traditional) subject-specific approach. The study involved 3,258 high
   school students, enrolled in either Course 2 or Geometry, in 11 schools
   in 5 geographically dispersed states. We constructed 3-level
   hierarchical linear models of scores on 3 end-of-year outcome measures:
   a test of common objectives, an assessment of problem solving and
   reasoning, and a standardized achievement test. Students in the
   integrated curriculum scored significantly higher than those in the
   subject-specific curriculum on the standardized achievement test.
   Significant student-level predictors included prior achievement, gender,
   and ethnicity. At the teacher level, in addition to Curriculum Type, the
   Opportunity to Learn and Classroom Learning Environment factors
   demonstrated significant power in predicting student scores, whereas
   Implementation Fidelity, Teacher Experience, and Professional
   Development were not significant predictors.},

Abstract = {This article describes teachers' collective work aimed at learning to
   teach mathematics for social justice. A situated, sociocultural
   perspective of learning guides this examination of teachers' negotiation
   of mathematical goals and social justice goals as they developed,
   implemented, and revised lessons for social justice. Teacher interviews,
   discussions, lessons, and written reflections were analyzed using
   grounded theory methodology, and teachers' conversations were examined
   concerning the relationship between mathematical goals and social
   justice goals. Analysis revealed that early tensions arose around
   balancing these goals, that teachers focused more attention on the
   social justice component, and that the instantiation of these goals in
   practice proved difficult. Variables that afford or constrain teachers'
   roles as social justice educators are discussed, and implications for
   teacher professional development are suggested.},

Abstract = {In this article, mathematics classrooms are conceptualized as
   heterogeneous spaces in which multiple figured worlds come into contact.
   The study explores how a group of high school students drew upon several
   figured worlds as they navigated mathematical discussions. Results
   highlight 3 major points. First, the students drew on 2 primary figured
   worlds: a mathematics learning figured world and a figured world of
   friendship and romance. Both of these figured worlds were racialized and
   gendered, and were actively constructed and contested by the students.
   Second, these figured worlds offered resources for 1 African American
   student, Dawn, to position herself powerfully within classroom
   hierarchies. Third, these acts of positioning allowed Dawn to engage in
   mathematical practices such as conjecturing, clarifying ideas, and
   providing evidence.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analytical approach for documenting the
   identities for teaching that mathematics teachers negotiate as they
   participate in 2 or more communities that define high-quality teaching
   differently. Drawing on data from the first 2 years of a collaboration
   with a group of middle school mathematics teachers, the article focuses
   on a critical initial condition for teachers to improve their
   practice-determining that the effort required is worthwhile. Analysis of
   the data indicates that the teachers were constructing distinct
   identities for teaching mathematics as they worked in the institutional
   context of the school and the context of ongoing professional
   development. The results speak directly to a central issue that arises
   when supporting teachers' efforts to improve their instructional
   practices: their motivation for affiliating with a vision of teaching
   that involves centering instruction on student thinking.},

Abstract = {This is a case Study of ail undergraduate calculus student's nonstandard
   conceptions of the real number line. Interviews with the student reveal
   robust conceptions of the real number line that include infinitesimal
   and infinite quantities and distances. Similarities between these
   conceptions and those of G. W. Leibniz are discussed and illuminated by
   the formalization of infinitesimals in A. Robinson's nonstandard
   analysis. These similarities suggest that these Student conceptions arc
   not mere misconceptions, but are nonstandard conceptions, pieces of
   knowledge that could be built into a system of real numbers proven to be
   as mathematically consistent and powerful as the standard system. This
   provides a new perspective oil students' ``struggles{''} with the real
   numbers, and adds to the discussion about the relationship between
   student conceptions and historical conceptions by focusing on mechanisms
   for maintaining cognitive and mathematical consistency.},

   Journal for Research in Mathematics Education (JRME) articles based on
   criteria suggested by the American Educational Research Association,
   American Psychological Association, and National Council for Measurement
   in Education (AERA, APA, \& NCME, 1999); the National Research Council
   (Shavelson \& Towne, 2002); and the American Statistical Association
   (ASA, 2007). We find the majority of JRME articles lacking in one or
   more respects, and we highlight criteria for JRME authors, reviewers,

Abstract = {Mathematics teachers' selection and implementation of instructional
   tasks were analyzed before, during, and after their participation in a
   professional development initiative that focused on selecting and
   enacting cognitively challenging mathematical tasks. Data collected from
   18 secondary mathematics teacher participants included tasks and student
   work from teachers' classrooms, lesson observations, and interviews. Ten
   secondary mathematics teachers who did not participate in the
   professional development initiative served as the contrast group and
   participated in I lesson observation each. Analysis of the data
   indicated that, following their participation in the professional
   development initiative, project teachers more frequently selected
   high-level tasks as the main instructional tasks in their classrooms and
   had improved the maintenance of high-level cognitive demands.
   Significant differences existed between project teachers and the
   contrast group in task selection and implementation. These differences
   were not influenced by the use of Standards-based or conventional
   curricula in project teachers' classrooms.},

Abstract = {This ``Brief Report{''} summarizes results from a study that
   investigated joint effects of two innovations adopted at a high school
   in an affluent suburban community in the northeast United States: 4 x 4
   block scheduling and the Standards-based curriculum, the Interactive
   Mathematics Program (IMP). By the end of 12th grade, cohorts of students
   who had studied IMP under a block schedule scored higher on most
   measures of mathematics achievement than had earlier cohorts of students
   who had studied a traditional high school mathematics curriculum under a
   traditional schedule. This article also describes actions taken by the
   school to build capacity before adopting the reforms. The results can be
   seen as an ``existence proof' of what can happen when these reforms are
   adopted jointly at a site that has put considerable effort into building
   capacity to implement them well.},

Abstract = {Teaching in a manner consistent with reform recommendations is a
   challenging and often overwhelming task. Part of this challenge involves
   using students' thinking and understanding as a basis for the
   development of mathematical ideas (cf. NCTM, 2000). The purpose of this
   article is to address this challenge by developing the notion of
   pedagogical content tool. A pedagogical content tool is a device such as
   a graph, diagram, equation, or verbal statement that a teacher
   intentionally uses to connect to student thinking while moving the
   mathematical agenda forward. We tender two examples of pedagogical
   content tools: Transformational record and generative alternative. These
   two pedagogical content tools are put forth as instructional
   counterparts to the Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) design
   heuristics of emergent models and guided reinvention, respectively. We
   illustrate the pedagogical content tools of transformational record and
   generative alternative by drawing on examples from two classroom
   teaching experiments in undergraduate differential equations.},

Abstract = {Debates about the future of school mathematics in the United States
   often center on whether standards-based instruction is improving or
   undermining students' achievement. Critical for making progress in these
   debates is information about the actual nature of classroom practice in
   U.S. classrooms. This article focuses on one key element of classroom
   practice-teaching-and presents the results of two studies of randomly
   selected, nationally representative U.S. eighth-grade mathematics
   lessons that were videotaped as part of the TIMSS 1995 and 1999 Video
   Studies. Analyses compare features of teaching found in these lessons
   with pedagogical recommendations for middle school teachers in the
   Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (Principles and
   Standards) in order to examine the extent to which teaching in U.S.
   eighth-grade classrooms is standards-based. Results show that typical
   mathematics teaching, in both 1995 and 1999, is more like the kind of
   traditional teaching reported for most of the past century (Cuban, 1993;
   Fey, 1979; Weiss, Pasley, Smith, Banilower, \& Heck, 2003; Welch, 1978)
   than the kind of teaching promoted in Principles and Standards.},

Abstract = {Unlike medicine, agriculture and industrial production, the field of
   education operates largely on the basis of ideology and professional
   consensus. As such, it is subject to fads and is incapable of the
   cumulative progress that follows from the application of the scientific
   method and from systematic collection and use of objective information
   in policy making. We will change education to make it an evidence-based
   field. We will accomplish this goal by dramatically improving the
   quality and relevance of research funded or conducted by the Department,
   by providing policy makers, educators, parents, and other concerned
   citizens with ready access to syntheses of research and objective
   information that allow more informed and effective decisions, and by
   encouraging the use of this knowledge (U.S. Department of Education,
   2002, p. 50).},

Abstract = {A number of recent efforts to improve mathematics instruction have
   focused on professional development activities designed to promote
   instruction that is consistent with professional standards such as those
   published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. This paper
   describes the results of a study investigating the degree to which
   teachers' use of instructional practices aligned with these reforms is
   related to improved student achievement, after controlling for student
   background characteristics and prior achievement. In particular we focus
   on the effects of curriculum on the relationship between instructional
   practices and student outcomes. We collected data on tenth-grade
   students during the 1997-98 academic year. Some students were enrolled
   in integrated math courses designed to be consistent with the reforms,
   whereas others took the more traditional algebra and geometry sequence.
   Use of instructional practices was measured through a teacher
   questionnaire, and student achievement was measured using both the
   multiple-choice and open-ended components of the Stanford achievement
   tests. Use of standards-based or reform practices was positively related
   to achievement on both tests for students in integrated math courses,
   whereas use of reform practices was unrelated to achievement in the more
   traditional algebra and geometry courses. These results suggest that
   changes to instructional practices may need to be coupled with changes
   in curriculum to realize effects on student achievement.},

Abstract = {In this study we compare 2 experimental programs for teaching mental
   addition and subtraction in the Dutch 2nd grade (N= 275). The goal of
   both programs is greater flexibility in mental arithmetic through use of
   the empty number line as a new mental model. The programs differ in
   instructional design to enable comparison of 2 contrasting instructional
   concepts. The Realistic Program Design (RPD) stimulates flexible use of
   solution procedures from the beginning by using realistic context
   problems. The Gradual Program Design (GPD) has as its purpose a gradual
   increase of knowledge through initial emphasis on procedural computation
   followed by flexible problem solving. We found that whereas RPD pupils
   showed a more varied use of solution procedures than the GPD pupils,
   this variation did not influence the procedural competence of the
   pupils. The empty number line appears to be a very powerful model for
   the learning of addition and subtraction up to 100.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to identify specific functions that
   reading, in combination with writing and talking, can serve in
   mathematical inquiries and thus to contribute to abetter understanding
   of how inquiry experiences can be planned and supported in mathematics
   classrooms. This purpose is achieved through an analysis of 3 classroom
   experiences in which secondary mathematics students engaged in ``inquiry
   cycles{''} on quite different topics. These instructional experiences
   were developed by a collaborative team of mathematics teachers,
   mathematics education researchers, and a reading researcher in the
   context of action research and teacher research. Analysis of the data
   led to the identification of 30 functions of reading that are specific
   to distinct elements of an inquiry cycle. On the basis of these findings
   we suggest that reading can serve multiple roles in inquiry-based
   mathematics classes and, in doing so, can afford students unique
   opportunities for learning mathematics.},

Abstract = {This article describes a three-tiered teaching experiment in which
   Leachers were studied over a protracted period of time as they attempted
   to understand and improve their approaches to one-to-one tutoring. In a
   three-tiered teaching experiment model, emphasis is placed on (a)
   establishing a collaborative relationship between the research staff and
   the teachers, (b) careful choice of tasks for leachers and their
   students, (c) the development of `'learning environments'' for the
   study, and (d) the use of continuous and diverse dependent measures. The
   study documented the initial and revised strategies of teachers as they
   tutored children over a period of 10 weeks. Various indices of teacher
   change are reported, and some of the strengths and limitations of the
   methodology are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this study, a number of learner variables that are related to
   mathematics achievement in actual learning situations were examined. The
   dynamic model of the learning process as developed by Boekaerts was
   taken as a starting point. Both trait-like self-referenced cognitions
   (viz., academic self-concept of mathematics ability, goal orientation,
   and attribution style) and situation-specific variables were included.
   In a group of 8th graders (ages 11-12; N = 186), marked differences
   between boys and girls on a mathematics test were found. These
   differences were parallelled by differences in both trait-like
   self-referenced cognitions and task-specific appraisals. It is concluded
   that boys experience learning situations where they are confronted with
   a mathematics test in a more positive way than girls do.},

Abstract = {This study examined relationships among interest, achievement motivation
   mathematical ability, the quality of experience when doing mathematics,
   and mathematics achievement. One hundred eight freshmen and sophomores
   (41 males, 67 females) completed interest ratings, an achievement
   motivation questionnaire, and the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test.
   These assessments were followed by 1 week of experience sampling.
   Mathematics grades were available from the year before the study
   started, from the same year, and from the following 3 years. In
   addition, a measure of the students' course level in mathematics was
   included. The results showed that quality of experience when doing
   mathematics was mainly related to interest Grades and course level were
   most strongly predicted by level of ability. interest was found to
   contribute significantly to the prediction of grades for the second year
   and to the prediction of course level. Quality of experience was
   significantly correlated with grades hut not course level.},

Abstract = {We present the evolving fraction conceptions of two elementary school
   children with mathematics learning disabilities (MLD). We use
   qualitative analyses to capture the mathematical knowledge and
   experiences of each child and show how teaching was used to support
   advancement of their fractional reasoning. Results illustrate two viable
   pathways of advancing fractional thinking, both of which reflect
   students' increasing levels of units coordination over time. We argue
   that recognizing and building on each child's strengths-while respecting
   and accommodating for their MLD-was central to promoting their learning.
   Results provide an existence proof of a new evidence base for
   student-centered, problem-based instruction for students with MLD,
   grounded in a careful understanding of student mathematical thinking and
   accommodations for cognitive differences.},

Abstract = {Teachers' noticing of classroom activity shapes who is invited to
   participate, who is valued, and whose forms of knowing are included in
   mathematics classrooms. We introduce a framework for multidimensional
   noticing for equity that captures the stretch and expanse of teachers'
   attention and sense making of the local, sociocultural, and historical
   aspects of mathematics classrooms. We use data from two teachers'
   classrooms to illuminate how their noticing of students' sociocultural
   selves, of the history of mathematics and schooling, and of students'
   potential futures informs enactment of culturally sustaining
   instructional practice. We discuss this framework in relation to calls
   in mathematics education to create more equitable and affirming
   classroom spaces for youth.},

Abstract = {Productive struggle-expending effort to make sense of something beyond
   one's current level of understanding-aids in learning mathematics
   concepts and procedures. In this study, we surveyed 197 parents with
   children in the 1st to the 5th grade on their beliefs about productive
   struggle. Beliefs were assessed via questionnaire and rating of a
   recorded lesson involving productive struggle. Parents also reported how
   often they helped with math homework and their child's ability in math.
   The results show that parents had diverse beliefs about the efficacy of
   productive struggle, with fathers favoring it more than mothers. A
   significant relation was found between parents' beliefs about productive
   struggle and reports of their child's ability in math. The findings of
   this study suggest that for productive struggle to be effective, parents
   must intentionally facilitate experiences through student-centered
   approaches. Programs for parents should emphasize specific
   evidence-based behaviors rather than broad generalizations about
   increased involvement with homework. Schools and educators should also
   provide guidance for parents to explain the potential harmful effects of
   gender stereotypes and parents' own math anxiety and to teach methods
   for limiting homework interaction while students grapple with difficult
   problems.},

Abstract = {To learn mathematical practices, students need opportunities to engage
   in them. But simply providing such opportunities may not be sufficient
   to support all students. Simultaneously, explicitly teaching
   mathematical practices could be problematic if instruction becomes
   prescriptive. This study investigated how teachers might make
   mathematical practices explicit in classroom discourse. Analyses of 26
   discussions from 3 mathematics classes revealed that teachers made
   mathematical practices explicit primarily after students had
   participated in them. I present a framework of 8 types of teacher moves
   that made mathematical practices explicit and argue that they did so
   without turning practices into prescriptions or reducing students'
   opportunities to engage in them. This suggests a need to expand
   conceptions of explicitness to promote access to mathematical practices.},

Abstract = {Tzur and Simon (2004) postulated 2 stages of development in learning a
   mathematical concept: participatory and anticipatory. In this article,
   we discuss the affordances for research of this stage distinction
   related to data analysis, task design, and assessment as demonstrated in
   a 2-year teaching experiment. We describe our modifications to and
   further explicate and exemplify the theoretical underpinnings of these
   stage constructs. We introduce a representation scheme and use it to
   trace the development of a concept from initial activity, through the
   participatory stage, and to the anticipatory stage.},

Abstract = {This study of early-career teachers identified a significant
   relationship between upper-elementary teachers' mathematical content
   knowledge and their students' mathematics achievement, after controlling
   for student- and teacher-level characteristics. Further, the
   mathematical content and pedagogical knowledge of middle-grades teachers
   were each directly and positively related to their students' mathematics
   achievement, with and without teacher-level controls. Significant
   interactions emerged between teachers' perceptions and knowledge
   influencing student achievement. Teachers' claimed awareness of their
   students' dispositions toward mathematics interacted with
   upper-elementary teachers' content knowledge; middlegrades teachers'
   beliefs regarding modeling mathematical solutions and organizing
   instruction to support incremental mastery of skills interacted with
   both content and pedagogical knowledge. Findings provide evidence of the
   relevance of teacher knowledge and perceptions for teacher preparation
   and professional development programs.},

Abstract = {This collective case study examines the influence of 4 third-grade
   teachers' beliefs and knowledge on their error-handling practices during
   class discussion of mathematics. Across cases, 3 dimensions of teachers'
   error-handling practices are identified and discussed in relation to
   teacher beliefs and knowledge: (a) intentional focus on flawed solutions
   in class discussion, (b) promotion of conceptual understanding through
   discussion of errors, and (c) mobilization of a community of learners to
   address errors. Study findings suggest that, although teachers' ways of
   handling student errors during class discussion of mathematics are
   clearly linked to both teacher beliefs and teacher knowledge, some
   aspects of teacher response are more strongly linked to knowledge and
   others are influenced more by beliefs.},

Abstract = {This ``Research Commentary{''} explores the roles of theoretical and
   empirical work in the development of productive lines of research. It
   elaborates on 3 main points. First, the dialectic between theory and
   empirical practice is highly productive for both: Theory is enriched by
   close attention to data, and one's understanding of empirical issues is
   deepened when one attends closely to theory. Second, an effective
   mechanism for making systematic progress is to focus on cases at the
   edge of one's (and the field's) collective theoretical understanding.
   Third, close observations of empirical phenomena often raise issues that
   have theoretical import and that give rise to new lines of work. These 3
   points, and implications, are illustrated with examples from my
   research.},

Abstract = {The article discusses the ways that less successful mathematics students
   used graphing software with capabilities similar to a basic graphing
   calculator to solve algebra problems in context. The study is based on
   interviewing students who learned algebra for 3 years in an environment
   where software tools were always present. We found differences between
   the work of these less successful students and the traditional
   problem-solving patterns of less successful students. These less
   successful students used the graphing software to obtain a broader view,
   to confirm conjectures, and to complete difficult operations. However,
   they delayed using symbolic formalism, and most of their solution
   attempts focused on numeric and graphic representations. Their process
   of reaching a solution was found to be relatively long, and the graphing
   software tool was often not used at all because it did not support
   symbolic formulation and manipulations.},

Abstract = {This article examines students' development of levels of understanding
   for measurement by describing the coordination of geometric reasoning
   with measurement and numerical strategies. In analyzing the reasoning
   and argumentation of 38 Grade 2 through Grade 10 students on linear
   measure tasks, we found support for the application and elaboration of
   our previously established categorization of children's length
   measurement levels: (1) guessing of length values by naive visual
   observation, (2) making inconsistent, uncoordinated reference to markers
   as units, and (3) using consistent and coordinated identification of
   units. We elaborated two of these categories. Observations supported
   sublevel distinctions between inconsistent identification (2a) and
   consistent yet only partially coordinated identification of units (2b).
   Evidence also supported a distinction between static (3a) and dynamic
   (3b) ways of coordinating length; we distinguish integrated abstraction
   (3b) from nonintegrated abstraction (3a) by examining whether students
   coordinate number and space schemes across multiple cases, or merely
   associate cases without coordinating schemes.},

Abstract = {We articulate and explicate a mechanism for mathematics conceptual
   learning that can serve as a basis for the design of mathematics
   lessons. The mechanism, reflection on activity-effect relationships,
   addresses the learning paradox (Pascual-Leone, 1976), a paradox that
   derives from careful attention to the construct of assimilation (Piaget,
   1970). The mechanism is an elaboration of Piaget's (200 1) reflective
   abstraction and is potentially useful for addressing some of the more
   intractable problems in teaching mathematics. Implications of the
   mechanism for lesson design are discussed and exemplified.},

Abstract = {The transformation to reform mathematics teaching is a daunting task. It
   is often unclear to teachers what such a classroom would really look
   like, let alone how to get there. This article addresses this question:
   How does a teacher, along with her students, go about establishing the
   sort of classroom community that can enact reform mathematics practices?
   An intensive year-long case study of one teacher was undertaken in an
   urban elementary classroom with Latino children. Data analysis generated
   developmental trajectories for teacher and student learning that
   describe the building of a math-talk learning community-a community in
   which individuals assist one another's learning of mathematics by
   engaging in meaningful mathematical discourse. The developmental
   trajectories in the Math-Talk Learning Community framework are (a)
   questioning, (b) explaining mathematical thinking, (c) sources of
   mathematical ideas, and (d) responsibility for learning.},

Abstract = {In this constructivist teaching experiment with 2 fourth graders I
   studied the coemergence of teaching and children's construction of a
   specific conception that supports the generation of improper fractions.
   The children's posing and solving tasks in a computer microworld
   promoted a modification in their fraction schemes. They advanced from
   thinking about a unit fraction as a part of a whole to thinking about it
   as standing in a multiplicative relationship with a reference whole (the
   iterative fraction scheme). In this article I report an intertwined
   analysis of the children's construction of this multiplicative
   relationship and an examination of the teacher's adaptation of learning
   situations (tasks) and teacher-learner interactions to fit within the
   constraints of the children's mathematical activity.},

Abstract = {Recently many researchers have focused on analyzing the structure of
   one-step word problems and the solution strategies employed by pupils.
   We have investigated the effect of mental schemes corresponding to
   additive and multiplicative situations in the process of interpreting
   and solving problems. The relative difficulties of problems classified
   according to their situations is considered through a written test
   administered to pupils in Grades 2, 3, and 4. The results seem to
   support the assumption that there is a developmental pattern in pupils'
   thinking depending on the problem situation.},

Abstract = {In this study we explore the potential for mathematics instruction of
   four reading strategies grounded. in transactional reading theory. On
   the basis of the descriptive study of 18 instructional episodes
   developed in 4 secondary mathematics classes as a result of
   collaborative action research, we show that encouraging mathematics
   students to talk, write, draw, and enact texts can provide them with
   concrete ways to construct and negotiate interpretations of what they
   read. In addition to helping students better understand the text read,
   acting on and acting out a text allow students to use that text as a
   springboard for sense-making and discussion of important mathematical
   ideas and issues about the nature of mathematics, especially when these
   reading experiences are supported by compatible classroom norms and
   values.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the tension between the traditional foundation of
   efficacy in teaching mathematics and current reform efforts in
   mathematics education. Drawing substantially on their experiences in
   learning mathematics, many teachers are disposed to teach mathematics by
   `'telling'': by stating facts and demonstrating procedures to their
   students. Clear and accurate telling provides a foundation for teachers'
   sense of efficacy-the belief that they can affect student
   learning-because the direct demonstration of mathematics is taken to be
   necessary for student learning. A strong sense of efficacy supports
   teachers' efforts to face difficult challenges and persist in the face
   of adversity. But current reforms that de-emphasize telling and focus on
   enabling students' mathematical activity undermine this basis of
   efficacy. For the current reform to generate deep and lasting changes,
   teachers must find new foundations for building durable efficacy beliefs
   that are consistent with reform-based teaching practices. Although
   productive new `'moorings'' for efficacy exist, research has not
   examined how practicing teachers' sense of efficacy shifts as they
   attempt to align their practice with reform principles. Suggestions for
   research to chart the development of, and change in, mathematics
   teachers' sense of efficacy are presented.},

Abstract = {Six classes received problem-centered mathematics instruction for 2
   years in second and third grade. This instruction was generally
   reflective of a socioconstructivist theory of knowing and compatible
   with recommendations for reform in mathematics education. A
   class-by-instruction factorial design was used to compare students in
   problem-centered classes for 2 years with students in problem-centered
   classrooms for 1 year, and with students in textbook classes for 2 years
   on a standardized achievement test. In addition, classes using
   problem-centered instruction for 2 years were compared with students in
   problem-centered classes for 1 year on an instrument designed to assess
   students' conceptual development in arithmetic and an instrument
   developed to examine personal goals and beliefs about reasons for
   success in mathematics. The results of the analyses indicate that
   significant differences exist in arithmetic learning for students in
   problem-centered classes for 2 years on the standardized achievement
   test and the arithmetic test The results indicate that after 2 years of
   instruction in reform-based classes, students score significantly higher
   on standardized measures of computational proficiency as well as
   conceptual understanding. Additionally, these students hold stronger
   beliefs about the importance of finding their own or different ways to
   solve problems.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the role of language in mathematical
   understanding and how the boundaries assigned to language determine its
   status. It focuses on a classic debate between two leading writers in
   hermeneutics, Gadamer and Habermas, and it shows how this debate can
   guide us in drawing the boundaries of mathematical learning. In
   particular, the article suggests that personal learning of mathematics
   is inseparable from the social practices within which learning takes
   place. Nevertheless, the teacher's task can be seen in terms of enabling
   the student to move between stressing the personal and stressing the
   social aspects of his or her mathematical learning. In this way the
   initiation of the student into the socially conventional ways of doing
   mathematics can be more effectively grounded in his or her personal
   experience.},

Abstract = {Textbooks present multiplication as merely a faster way of doing
   repeated addition. However, research has shown that multiplication
   requires higher-order multiplicative thinking, which the child develops
   out of addition. Three hundred thirty-six children in grades 1-5 were
   interviewed individually using a Piagetian task to study their
   development from additive to multiplicative thinking. Multiplicative
   thinking was found to appear early (45\% of second graders demonstrated
   some multiplicative thinking) and to develop slowly (only 48\% of fifth
   graders demonstrated consistently solid multiplicative thinking). It was
   concluded that the introduction of multiplication in second grade is
   appropriate but that educators must not expect all children to use
   multiplication, even in fifth grade.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the role that four second graders' use of the
   hundreds board played in supporting their conceptual development over a
   10-week period.  Particular attention is given to the transition from
   counting by ones to counting by tens and ones.  The analysis indicates
   that the children's use of the hundreds board did not support the
   construction of increasingly sophisticated concepts of ten.  However,
   children's use of the hundreds board did appear to support their ability
   to reflect to their mathematical activity once they had made this
   conceptual advance.  The constructivist perspective exemplified in the
   analysis is constrasted with a sociocultural perspective on mathematical
   development.  The differing roles attributed to cultural tools are
   clarified, and potentially complementary aspects of the two perspectives
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this response to Robert Orton, I address each of the major points he
   raises and attempt to clarify the discrepancies in our positions. I give
   particular attention to his approach of reframing issues in terms of the
   categories of traditional academic philosophy. In adopting this stance,
   Orton (a) presents a highly idiosyncratic interpretation of the
   Cartesian dualism, (b) creates a gulf between theory and practice, and
   (c) implies that the social and cultural aspects of mathematical
   activity can be dismissed. I discuss each of these points and further
   develop my position by outlining Putnam's (1987) pragmatic realism,
   clarifying why Rorty's (1979) work might be of interest to mathematics
   educators, and revisiting Bereiter's (1985) learning paradox. I then
   conclude by exploring the relationship between the resulting nondualist
   approach and John Dewey's philosophy and pedagogy.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes from several vantage points a classroom lesson in
   which a student teacher was unsuccessful in providing a conceptually
   based justification for the standard division-of-fractions algorithm. We
   attempt to understand why the lesson failed, what it reveals about
   learning to teach, and what the implications are for mathematics teacher
   education. We focus on (a) the student teacher's beliefs about good
   mathematics teaching, her knowledge related to division of fractions,
   and her beliefs about learning to teach; and (b) the treatment of
   division of fractions in the mathematics methods course she took. The
   student teacher's conception of good mathematics teaching included
   components compatible with current views of effective mathematics
   teaching. However, these beliefs are difficult to achieve without a
   stronger conceptual knowledge base and a greater commitment to use
   available resources and to engage in hard thinking than she possessed.
   Further, the mathematics methods course did not require the student
   teacher to reconsider her knowledge base, to confront the contradictions
   between her knowledge base and at least some of her beliefs, or to
   reassess her beliefs about how she would learn to teach. These findings
   suggest that mathematics teacher education programs should reconsider
   how they provide subject matter knowledge and opportunities to teach it,
   and whether and how they challenge student teachers' existing beliefs.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this commentary is to articulate the need to investigate
   problems of mathematics instruction at community colleges. We briefly
   describe some features of this often-ignored institution and the current
   status of research. We also make an argument for how investigations of
   instruction in this setting can both advance our understanding of this
   particular context and give practitioners tools to deal with pressures
   from policymakers to show short-term results. This work is the result of
   a collaborative effort between community college practitioners and
   researchers, responding to the needs of their work in mathematics
   education.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore how a school in Aotearoa {[}New Zealand]
   infuses the identity of Indigenous students into the school-based
   curriculum through the promotion of their language and culture in
   mathematics lessons. Bernstein's pedagogic device illustrates how
   teachers' practices were influenced by being able to think the
   ``unthinkable.{''} This came from the contestation that arose when
   competing bodies of knowledge had to be integrated both at the school
   level and at the classroom level. For equity to be achieved regarding
   students' mathematics learning;parents' and the community's aspirations
   for students' education need to be infused into debates about the
   knowledge that teachers are expected to include in their teaching. This
   enables the local context to make a positive contribution to students'
   learning. It also implies that programs for improvement should not be
   imposed on schools unless there are opportunities for them to be adapted
   to the needs of individual schools.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a 7th-grade classroom teaching
   experiment that supported students' understanding of integer addition
   and subtraction. The experiment was conducted to test and revise a
   hypothetical learning trajectory so as to propose a potential
   instructional theory for integer addition and subtraction. The
   instructional sequence, which was based on a financial context, was
   designed using the Realistic Mathematics Education theory. Additionally,
   an empty, vertical number line (VNL) is posited as a potentially viable
   model to support students' organizing their addition and subtraction
   strategies. Particular emphasis is placed on the mathematical practices
   that were established in this setting. These practices indicate that
   students can successfully draw on their experiences with assets, debts,
   and net worths to create meaning for integer addition and subtraction.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the nature and extent of reasoning and proof in
   the written (i.e., intended) curriculum of 20 contemporary high school
   mathematics textbooks. Both the narrative and exercise sets in lessons
   dealing with the topics of exponents, logarithms, and polynomials were
   examined. The extent of proof-related reasoning varied by topic and
   textbook. Overall, about 50\% of the identified properties in the 3
   topic areas were justified, with about 30\% of the addressed properties
   justified with a general argument and about 20\% justified with an
   argument about a specific case. However, less than 6\% of the exercises
   in the homework sets involved proof-related reasoning, with developing
   an argument and investigating a conjecture as the most frequently
   occurring types of proof-related reasoning.},

Abstract = {This study investigated introductory calculus students' spontaneous
   reasoning about limit concepts guided by an interactionist theory of
   metaphorical reasoning developed by Max Black. In this perspective,
   strong metaphors are ontologically creative by virtue of their emphasis
   (commitment by the producer) and resonance (support for high degrees of
   elaborative implication). Analysis of 120 students' written and verbal
   descriptions of their thinking about challenging limit concepts resulted
   in the characterization of 5 clusters of strong metaphors. These
   clusters were based on the objects, relationships, and logic related to
   intuitions about (a) a collapse in dimension, (b) approximation and
   error analyses, (c) proximity in a space of point-locations, (d) a small
   physical scale beyond which nothing exists, and (e) the treatment of
   infinity as a number. Students' reasoning with these metaphors had
   significant implications for the images they formed and the claims and
   justifications they provided about multiple limit concepts.},

Abstract = {This study was prompted by the current availability of newly designed
   mathematics curriculum materials for elementary teachers. Seeking to
   understand the role that reform-oriented curricula might play in
   supporting teacher learning, we studied the ways in which 8 teachers in
   the same school used one such curriculum, Investigations in Number,
   Data, and Space (TERC, 1998). Findings revealed that teachers had
   orientations toward using curriculum materials that influenced the way
   they used them regardless of whether they agree with the mathematical
   vision within the materials. As a result, different uses of the
   curriculum led to different opportunities for student and teacher
   learning. Inexperienced teachers were most likely to take a piloting
   stance toward the curriculum and engage all of its resources fully.
   Findings suggest that reform efforts might include assisting teachers in
   examining unfamiliar curriculum resources and developing new approaches
   to using these materials.},

Abstract = {The findings of 54 research studies were integrated through
   meta-analysis to determine the effects of calculators on student
   achievement and attitude levels. Effect sizes were generated through
   Glassian techniques of meta-analysis, and Hedges and Olkin's (1985)
   inferential statistical methods were used to test the significance of
   effect size data. Results revealed that students' operational skills and
   problem-solving skills improved when calculators were an integral part
   of testing and instruction. The results for both skill types were mixed
   when calculators were not part of assessment, but in all cases,
   calculator use did not hinder the development of mathematical skills.
   Students using calculators had better attitudes toward mathematics than
   their noncalculator counterparts. Further research is needed in the
   retention of mathematics skills after instruction and transfer of skills
   to other mathematics-related subjects.},

Abstract = {This article reports on an exploratory study of the way that eight
   mathematics and secondary education mathematics majors read and
   reflected on four student-generated arguments purported to be proofs of
   a single theorem. The results suggest that such undergraduates tend to
   focus on surface features of arguments and that their ability to
   determine whether arguments are proofs is very limited-perhaps more so
   than either they or their instructors recognize. The article begins by
   discussing arguments (purported proofs) regarded as texts and
   validations of those arguments, that is, reflections of individuals
   checking whether such arguments really are proofs of theorems. It
   relates the mathematics research community's views of proofs and their
   validations to ideas from reading comprehension and literary theory.
   Then, a detailed analysis of the four student-generated arguments is
   given and the eight students' validations of them are analyzed.},

Abstract = {The study investigated the role of students' everyday knowledge of
   decimals in supporting the development of their knowledge of decimals.
   Sixteen students, ages I I and 12, from a lower economic area, were
   asked to work in pairs (one member of each pair a more able student and
   one a less able student) to solve problems that tapped common
   misconceptions about decimal fractions. Half the pairs worked on
   problems presented in familiar contexts and half worked on problems
   presented without context. A comparison of pretest and posttest results
   revealed that students who worked on contextual problems made
   significantly more progress in their knowledge of decimals than did
   those who worked on noncontextual problems. Dialogues between pairs of
   students during problem solving were analyzed with respect to the
   arguments used. Results from this analysis suggested that greater
   reciprocity existed in the pairs working on the contextualized problems,
   partly because, for those problems, the less able students more commonly
   took advantage of their everyday knowledge of decimals. It is postulated
   that the students who solved contextualized problems were able to build
   scientific understanding of decimals by reflecting on their everyday
   knowledge as it pertained to the meaning of decimal numbers and the
   results of decimal calculations.},

Abstract = {In this article we report on part of a study of the epistemological
   perspectives of practicing research mathematicians. We explore the
   identities that mathematicians present to the world in their writing and
   the ways in which they represent the nature of mathematical activity.
   Analysis of 53 published research papers reveals substantial variations
   in these aspects of mathematicians' writing. The interpretation of these
   variations is supported by extracts from interviews with the
   mathematicians. We discuss the implications for students and for novice
   researchers beginning to write about their mathematical activity.},

Abstract = {In this review we examine recent research in the area of motivation in
   mathematics education and discuss findings from research perspectives in
   this domain. We note consistencies across research perspectives that
   suggest a set of generalizable conclusions about the contextual factors,
   cognitive processes, and benefits of interventions that affect students'
   and teachers' motivational attitudes. Criticisms are leveled concerning
   the lack of theoretical guidance driving the conduct and interpretation
   of the majority of studies in the field. Few researchers have attempted
   to extend current theories of motivation in ways that are consistent
   with the current research on learning and classroom discourse. In
   particular, researchers interested in studying motivation in the content
   domain of school mathematics need to examine the relationship that
   exists between mathematics as a socially constructed field and students'
   desire to achieve.},

Abstract = {This is a study of the beliefs and belief structures of 4 preservice
   secondary mathematics teachers as they progressed through a 4-quarter
   sequence in mathematics education including student teaching. We
   considered the notions of centrally and peripherally held beliefs and
   whether beliefs were held dualistically or contextually. The various
   ways in which the teachers structured their beliefs helped account for
   the fact that some beliefs were permeable whereas others were not. The
   nature of the evidence supporting the teachers' beliefs was considered
   particularly as that evidence related to the voices of significant
   others or to what the individuals valued. A scheme for conceptualizing
   the professional development of preservice teachers is posited.},

Abstract = {Twenty-four sixth-grade children participated in clinical interviews on
   ratio and proportion before they had received any instruction in the
   domain. A framework involving problems of four semantic types was used
   to develop the interview questions, and student thinking was analyzed
   within the semantic types in terms of mathematical components critical
   to proportional reasoning. Two components, relative thinking and
   unitizing, were consistently related to higher levels of sophistication
   in a student's overall problem-solving ability within a semantic type.
   Part-part-whole problems failed to elicit any proportional reasoning
   because they could be solved using less sophisticated methods.
   Stretcher/shrinker problems were the most difficult because students
   failed to recognize the multiplicative nature of the problem situations.
   Student thinking was most sophisticated in the case of associated sets
   when problems were presented in a concrete pictorial mode.},

Abstract = {Twelve first-grade teachers participated in a staff development effort
   designed to provide them with opportunities to examine ways to teach the
   first-grade mathematics curriculum from a problem-solving perspective
   using a Cognitively Guided Instruction framework. Another group of 12
   first-grade teachers and their classrooms comprised the comparison
   group. The percentage of minority students in these 24 urban classrooms
   ranged from 57\% to 99\%. Teachers in the experimental group taught
   arithmetic through the use of word problems, and their students spent
   considerably less time on skill worksheet drills. Instruction in
   experimental classes focused on the process that students used in their
   solutions rather than on the production of written answers to exercises.
   Students in experimental classes performed significantly better in
   solving word problems as well as completing number facts.},

Abstract = {This article introduces unit transformation graphs (UTGs) as a tool for
   diagramming the ways students use sequences of mental actions to solve
   mathematical tasks. We report findings from a study in which we
   identified patterns in the ways preservice elementary school teachers
   relied on working memory to coordinate mental actions when operating in
   fraction multiplication settings. UTGs account for the constraint of
   working memory in sequencing mental actions to solve mathematical tasks.
   They also explain the power of units coordinating structures in
   offloading demands on working memory. At the end of the article, we
   consider some of the research implications for these
   findings-specifically, ways that UTGs can lend explanatory and
   illustrative power to analyses of students' mathematics.},

Abstract = {Many mathematics educators believe a goal of instruction is for students
   to obtain conviction and certainty in mathematical statements using the
   same types of evidence that mathematicians do. However, few empirical
   studies have examined how mathematicians use proofs to obtain conviction
   and certainty. We report on a study in which 16 advanced mathematics
   doctoral students were given a task-based interview in which they were
   presented with various sources of evidence in support of a specific
   mathematical claim and were asked how convinced they were that the claim
   was true after reviewing this evidence. In particular, we explore why
   our participants retained doubts about our claim after reading its proof
   and how they used empirical evidence to reduce those doubts.},

Abstract = {This study introduces inferentialism and, particularly, the Game of
   Giving and Asking for Reasons (GoGAR), as a new theoretical perspective
   for investigating qualities of procedural and conceptual knowledge in
   mathematics. The study develops a framework in which procedural
   knowledge and conceptual knowledge are connected to limited and rich
   qualities of GoGARs. General characteristics of limited GoGARs are their
   atomistic, implicit, and noninferential nature, as opposed to rich
   GoGARs, which are holistic, explicit, and inferential. The mathematical
   discussions of a Grade 6 class serve the case to show how the framework
   of procedural and conceptual GoGARs can be used to give an account of
   qualitative differences in procedural and conceptual knowledge in the
   teaching of mathematics.},

Abstract = {In this Brief Report, we share the main findings from our line of
   research into embodied cognition and proof activities. First, attending
   to students' gestures during proving activities can reveal aspects of
   mathematical thinking not apparent in their speech, and analyzing
   gestures after proof production can contribute significantly to our
   understanding of students' proving practices, particularly when
   attending to dynamic gestures depicting relationships that are difficult
   to communicate verbally. Second, directing students to produce physical
   actions before asking them to construct a mathematical proof has the
   potential to influence their subsequent reasoning in useful ways, as
   long as the directed actions have a relationship with the proof content
   that is clearly meaningful to the students. We discuss implications for
   assessment practices and teacher education, and we suggest directions
   for future research into embodied mathematical proof practices.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to shed light on the mathematics-learning
   experiences of students who were enrolled in non-credit-bearing remedial
   mathematics courses at a 4-year university. Non-credit-bearing remedial
   mathematics courses have a long curricular history in both 2-year and
   4-year higher education institutions, but students' mathematics-learning
   experiences in these courses have been largely unexplored. Furthermore,
   other recent studies have evinced the otherwise anecdotal supposition
   that African American learners, particularly, are disproportionately
   placed in these courses. In this study, students' narratives are the
   primary unit of analysis, and the data are derived from semistructured
   interviews with then-enrolled students and observations in a
   non-credit-bearing remedial mathematics course at a public, 4-year
   university. The study's findings center on two psychosocial phenomena
   amid these students' mathematics learning experiences: identity
   satisficing and racialized identity threat. The article closes with
   implications for future research regarding both non-credit-bearing
   remedial mathematics courses and mathematics-learning identities and
   experiences.},

Abstract = {Recent reform movements have emphasized students making meaning of
   algebraic relationships; however, research on student thinking and
   learning often remains disconnected from the design of widely used
   curricular materials. Although a previous examination of algebra
   textbooks (Nathan, Long, \& Alibali, 2002) demonstrated a preference for
   a symbols-first approach, research has demonstrated that Algebra I
   students' performance on verbally presented problems is better than on
   symbolic equations, consistent with cognitive theories suggesting the
   value of concreteness fading. The present study investigates whether
   current textbooks used in Algebra I courses demonstrate a
   formalisms-first approach using five different analyses. Results show
   that despite nearly 2 decades of research on student learning, the
   conventional textbooks used in most classrooms have been resistant to
   change and emphasize manipulation with symbols prior to making sense of
   verbal scenarios.},

Abstract = {Encouraging students to develop multiple solutions for given problems is
   an important way to improve mathematical knowledge. However, the
   influence of this teaching element on students' interest-related
   motivational orientations is an open question. In this article, we
   report the results of an experimental study (N = 145) that was carried
   out to investigate the influence of prompting students to construct
   multiple solutions for real-world problems with vague conditions on
   students' interest in mathematics as well as on their experiences of
   competence and autonomy and the number of solutions developed. A
   positive effect of the intervention on students' interest was found
   using inferential and path analyses. The number of solutions developed
   by students and their experiences of competence and autonomy mediated
   the effects of prompting multiple solutions on interest. Implications
   for teaching practices and future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study investigated discursive positioning moves that facilitated
   Latino/a English learners' (ELs) opportunities to take on agentive
   problem-solving roles in group mathematical discussion. A focus on
   mechanisms that support students' agentive participation is consistent
   with our view that recurrent experiences participating and being
   positioned in particular ways contribute to identity development.
   Findings suggest several ways that discursive positioning facilitated
   ELs' agentive participation, including via: (a) explicit statements that
   validated ELs' reasoning, (b) invitations to share, justify, or clarify
   thinking that positioned ELs as competent problem solvers, and (c)
   inviting peers to respond to an EL's idea in ways that positioned the
   idea as important and/or mathematically justified.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Teaching experiments have generated several hypotheses concerning the
   construction of fraction schemes and operations and relationships among
   them. In particular, researchers have hypothesized that children's
   construction of splitting operations is crucial to their construction of
   more advanced fractions concepts (Steffe, 2002). The authors propose
   that splitting constitutes a psychological structure similar to that of
   a mathematical group (Piaget, 1970b): a structure that introduces mutual
   reversibility of students' partitioning and iterating operations that
   the authors refer to as the splitting loope. Data consisted of 66
   sixth-grade students' written performance on 20 tasks designed to
   provoke responses that would indicate particular fractions schemes and
   operations. Findings are consistent with hypotheses from related
   teaching experiments. In particular, they demonstrate-consistent with
   the notion of the splitting loope-that equipartitioning and the
   partitive unit fraction scheme mediate the construction of splitting
   from partitioning and iterating operations.},

Abstract = {In a small-scale, 8-month teaching experiment, the author aimed to
   establish and maintain mathematical caring relations (MCRs) (Hackenberg,
   2005c) with 4 6th-grade students. From a teacher's perspective,
   establishing MCRs involves holding the work of orchestrating
   mathematical learning for students together with an orientation to
   monitor and respond to energetic fluctuations that may accompany student
   teacher interactions. From a student's perspective, participating in an
   MCR involves some openness to the teacher's interventions in the
   student's mathematical activity and some willingness to pursue questions
   of interest. In this article, the author elucidates the nature of
   establishing MCRs with 2 of the 4 students in the study and examines
   what is mathematical about these caring relations. Analysis revealed
   that student teacher interaction can be viewed as a linked chain of
   perturbations; in student teacher interaction aimed toward the
   establishment of MCRs, the linked chain tends toward perturbations that
   are bearable (Tzur, 1995) for both students and teachers.},

Abstract = {In this rejoinder, the authors further detail their positions on the
   role of gaps analyses in mathematics education research as outlined in
   the previous 2 articles. They clarify areas of agreement and probe areas
   of disagreement, focusing on the benefits and dangers they see in either
   emphasizing educational disparities between groups or shifting the focus
   to the advancement of particular groups. The authors discuss ways in
   which their backgrounds have shaped their differences in perspectives
   and priorities, including whether socioeconomic disparities or racial
   and ethnic identity are more focal in their work. Suggestions for
   lessening the dangers of gaps analyses are discussed.},

Abstract = {In the study reported here, I examined the diagrams that mathematically
   capable high school students produced in solving applied calculus
   problems in which a diagram was provided in the problem statement.
   Analyses of the diagrams contained in written solutions to selected
   free-response problems from the 1996 BC level Advanced Placement
   Calculus Examination provided insight into the various ways that
   students modified these diagrams and constructed new diagrams. I
   investigated relationships between the frequency or nature of the
   diagrams produced by high- and low-scoring male and female students and
   students' problem-solving success. Females, who were less successful in
   problem solving, produced more diagrams than males. Diagrams constructed
   or modified by males tended to be simpler than the more elaborate
   versions produced by females.},

Abstract = {Information processing researchers have assumed that algebra symbol
   skills depend on mastery of the abstract rules presented in the
   curriculum (Matz, 1980; Sleeman, 1986). Thus, students' ubiquitous
   algebra errors have been taken as indicating the need to embed algebra
   in rich contextual settings (Kaput, 1995; National Council of Teachers
   of Mathematics {[}NCTM] Algebra Working Group, 1998). This study
   explored a nonrepresentational account of symbolic algebra skills as
   feature correlation within the visual field. We present evidence that
   algebra students respond spontaneously to the visual patterns of the
   notational display apart from engagement with the declarative content of
   the rules. Thus, persistent algebra errors may reflect disengagement
   from declarative content rather than an inability to deal with it. We
   sketch a Lexical Support System designed to sustain students' engagement
   with the declarative content of algebraic rules and processes, thus
   complementing the exciting curricular possibilities being developed for
   referentially rich algebra.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {259-289},

Abstract = {The idea of data as a mixture of signal and noise is perhaps the most
   fundamental concept in statistics. Research suggests, however, that
   current instruction is not helping students to develop this idea, and
   that though many students know, for example, how to compute means or
   medians, they do not know how to apply or interpret them. Part of the
   problem may be that the interpretations we often use to introduce data
   summaries, including viewing averages as typical scores or fair shares,
   provide a poor conceptual basis for using them to represent the entire
   group for purposes such as comparing one group to another. To explore
   the challenges of learning to think about data as signal and noise, we
   examine the ``signal/noise{''} metaphor in the context of three
   different statistical processes: repeated measures, measuring
   individuals, and dichotomous events. On the basis of this analysis, we
   make several recommendations about research and instruction.},

Abstract = {In 4 Grade 2 classrooms, children learned about transformational
   geometry and symmetry by designing quilts. All 4 teachers participated
   in professional development focused on understanding children's thinking
   in arithmetic. Therefore, the teachers elicited student talk as a window
   for understanding student thinking and adjusting instruction in
   mathematics to promote the development of understanding and used the
   same tasks and materials. Two of the 4 teachers participated in
   additional workshops on students' thinking about space and geometry, and
   they elicited more sustained and elaborate patterns of classroom
   conversations about transformational geometry. These differences were
   mirrored by students' achievement differences that were sustained over
   time. We attribute these differences in classroom discourse and student
   achievement to differences in teachers' knowledge about typical
   milestones and trajectories of children's reasoning about space and
   geometry.},

Abstract = {In this study we addressed 2 questions: (a) How can we document
   opportunities to learn aligned with the NCTM Standards? (b) How can we
   support elementary teachers' efforts to provide such opportunities? We
   conducted a study of the effect of curriculum (problem solving vs.
   skills) and professional development (subject-matter focused vs.
   collegial support) on practices and learning. From analyses of
   videotapes and field notes, we created 3 scales for estimating students'
   opportunities to learn. Analyses of fractions instruction in 21
   elementary classrooms provided evidence of the technical quality of the
   indicators and indicated that support for teachers' knowledge may be
   required for a problem-solving curriculum to be beneficial.},

Abstract = {Evidence shows that class discussion is important in students'
   development of mathematical conceptions. Theoretically, the process of
   contradiction and resolution is central to the transformation of
   thought. This article is a report of an 18-month investigation of a
   teacher's actions during class discussions in a 2nd-grade classroom in
   which students' disagreement was resolved by argumentation. Although the
   teacher valued children's reports of their reasoning, the context of
   argument in discussion was characterized by the high priority she
   afforded their roles as critical listeners. Her sensitivity in
   communicating her expectations for students' participation was evident
   during both discussion and disagreement. Moreover, the teacher
   participated with the students to create patterns of interaction and
   discourse that enabled children to shift their cognitive attention from
   making social sense to making sense of their mathematical experiences.},

Abstract = {The analysis in this paper focuses on the relationship between classroom
   discourse and mathematical development. We give particular attention to
   reflective discourse, in which mathematical activity is objectified and
   becomes an explicit topic of conversation. We differentiate between
   students' development of particular mathematical concepts and their
   development of a general orientation to mathematical activity. Specific
   issues addressed include both the teacher's role and the role of
   symbolization in supporting reflective shifts in the discourse. We
   subsequently contrast our analysis of reflective discourse with
   Vygotskian accounts of learning that also stress the importance of
   social interaction and semiotic mediation. We then relate the discussion
   to characterizations of classroom discourse derived from Lakatos'
   philosophical analysis.},

Abstract = {In our editorial last January, Herbst et al. (2022) echoed a question
   often raised by reviewers of manuscripts: What is this manuscript's
   contribution to our research field? In that first elaboration on how
   manuscripts may contribute to the field of research in mathematics
   education, we discussed the contributions of basic research. In this
   editorial, motivated by the illustrations provided by the articles
   included in this issue, we do a similar exercise with applied research.
   We argue that, beyond answering the specific questions posed, applied
   research studies in mathematics education can contribute to our field by
   offering benchmark conceptualizations of the systems in which
   research-generated knowledge is usable or by identifying aspects of
   these systems for which better theory or measures may be needed.},

Abstract = {Changes in U.S. textbooks indicate that U.S. first-grade students in the
   Common Core era were exposed to a wider variety of word problem types
   than students in previous generations were. We compared the performance
   of U.S. first graders in the Common Core era with that of previous
   generations in solving 11 types of additive word problems to investigate
   a decades-long debate-whether certain types of word problems are
   inherently more difficult than others or whether relative difficulty is
   influenced by exposure. We found that overall patterns of relative
   difficulty persist; however, U.S. first graders in the Common Core era
   outperformed their historical counterparts when solving the types of
   problems that rarely appeared in textbooks used in the 1980s.},

Abstract = {This article documents differences between novice and experienced
   undergraduate students' processes of reading mathematical proofs as
   revealed by moment-by moment, think-aloud protocols. We found three key
   reading behaviors that describe how novices' reading differed from that
   of their experienced peers: alternative task models, accrual of
   premises, and warranting. Alternative task models refer to the types of
   goals that students set up for their reading of the text, which may
   differ from identifying and justifying inferences. Accrual of premises
   refers to the way novice readers did not distinguish propositions in the
   theorem statement as assumptions or conclusions and thus did not use
   them differently for interpreting the proof. Finally, we observed
   variation in the type and quality of warrants, which we categorized as
   illustrate with examples, construct a miniproof, or state the warrant in
   general form.},

Abstract = {Early education is replete with debates about ``academic{''} versus
   ``play{''} approaches. We evaluated 2 interventions, the Budding Blocks
   (BB) mathematics curriculum and the BB synthesized with scaffolding of
   play to promote executive function (BBSEF), compared to a
   business-as-usual (BAU) control using a 3-aimed cluster randomized trial
   with more than 1,000 children in 84 preschool classrooms across three
   districts (multiracial or multiethnic, low income, 27\% English Language
   Learner). Impact estimates for BBSEF were mixed in sign, small in
   magnitude, and insignificant. Most impact estimates for 1313 were
   positive, but only a few were statistically significant, with more in
   the kindergarten year (delayed effects), including both mathematics
   achievement and executive function (EF) competencies. Gains in both
   mathematics and EF can be mutually supportive and thus resist the
   fade-out effect.},

   distinguished middlegrades mathematics classrooms that were organized
   around conceptually oriented activity and marked by African American
   students' success on state assessments. We identified these forms of
   practice based on a comparative analysis of teaching in (a) classrooms
   in which there was evidence of conceptually oriented instruction and in
   which African American students performed better than predicted by their
   previous state assessment scores and (b) classrooms in which there was
   evidence of conceptually oriented instruction but in which African
   American students did not perform better than predicted on previous
   state assessment scores. The resulting forms of practice can inform
   professional learning for preservice and in-service teachers.},

Abstract = {This article specifies how the setup, or introduction, of cognitively
   demanding tasks is a crucial phase of middle-grades mathematics
   instruction. We report on an empirical study of 165 middle-grades
   mathematics teachers' instruction that focused on how they introduced
   tasks and the relationship between how they introduced tasks and the
   nature of students' opportunities to learn mathematics in the concluding
   whole-class discussion. Findings suggest that in lessons in which (a)
   the setup supported students to develop common language to describe
   contextual features and mathematical relationships specific to the task
   and (b) the cognitive demand of the task was maintained in the setup,
   concluding whole-class discussions were characterized by higher quality
   opportunities to learn.},

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {This study investigated how elementary teachers in a mathematics lesson
   study made sense of student learning, teaching, and content, as related
   to using representations in teaching multidigit subtraction, and how
   changes occurred over time in their talk and practice. The lesson-study
   process paved a group talk path along which teacher talk shifted from
   superficial to deeper consideration of student learning. By providing a
   context in which interactions of diverse ideas drove teacher learning,
   lesson study facilitated teachers making connections between the craft
   knowledge of teaching and scholarly knowledge. Individual teacher talk

Abstract = {Attention to gender in mathematics education research can be
   characterized by a lack of clarity (cf. Glasser \& Smith, 2008). The
   importance of clarity in definitions of gender is discussed, and several
   conceptual models of gender are presented. Four of these models begin
   with biological sex differences but draw attention to other aspects of
   gender. Four models set biology aside and are based on social and
   cultural theories. Some of the advantages of the latter for mathematics
   education researchers are identified.},

Abstract = {The current study examined the mathematical achievement of high school
   students enrolled for 3 years in one of three NSF funded Standards-based
   curricula (IMP, CMIC, MMOW). The focus was on traditional topics in
   mathematics as measured by subtests of a standardized achievement test
   and a criterion-referenced test of mathematics achievement. Students
   generally scored at or above the national mean on the achievement
   subtests. Hierarchical linear modeling results showed that prior
   mathematics knowledge was a significant but modest predictor of
   achievement, student SES had a moderate effect, and increasing
   concentrations of African American students in a classroom were
   associated with a stronger effect of attendance on achievement. No
   differences on the standardized achievement subtests emerged among the
   Standards-based curricula studied once background variables were taken
   into account. The two suburban districts providing data for the
   criterion-referenced test achieved well above the national norm.},

Abstract = {Our purpose is to bring together perspectives concerning the processing
   and use of statistical graphs to identify critical factors that appear
   to influence graph comprehension and to suggest instructional
   implications. After providing a synthesis of information about the
   nature and structure of graphs, we define graph comprehension. We
   consider 4 critical factors that appear to affect graph comprehension:
   the purposes for using graphs, task characteristics, discipline
   characteristics, and reader characteristics. A construct called graph
   sense is defined. A sequence for ordering the introduction of graphs is
   proposed. We conclude with a discussion of issues involved in making
   sense of quantitative information using graphs and ways instruction may
   be modified to promote such sense making.},

Abstract = {In this study, I investigated 27 university calculus students'
   mathematical beliefs and connections between those beliefs and their
   understandings of limit. Participants were selected on the basis of
   questionnaire and interview responses to real-number, infinity,
   function, and sources-of-conviction items. Data obtained in a subsequent
   limit interview suggest a relationship between sources of conviction and
   understanding of limit; students with external sources of conviction
   gave more incoherent or inappropriate definitions of limit, held more
   misconceptions of limit as bound or unreachable, and were less able to
   justify limit calculations than those with internal sources of
   conviction. The influence of content beliefs on understanding of limit
   is less evident.},

Abstract = {In this report I offer an exploration of the insights that may be
   provided by a situated perspective on learning. Through an extension of
   my previous analysis of students learning mathematics in 2 schools
   (Boaler, 1998), I consider the ways in which a focus on the classroom
   community and the behaviors and practices implicit within such
   communities may increase one's understanding of students' mathematical
   knowledge production and use. The implications of such a focus for
   classroom pedagogy and assessment as well as for research in mathematics
   education are considered.},

Abstract = {This article describes a research project that examined the effects of
   the Computer-intensive Algebra (CLA) and traditional algebra curricula
   on students' understanding of the function concept. The foundation for
   the research is a proposed conceptual framework that describes function
   knowledge in terms of component competencies. The results indicated that
   the CIA students achieved a better overall understanding of functions
   and were better at the components of modeling, interpreting, and
   translating. No significant differences were found for reifying, which
   emerged as the most difficult component in the proposed function model.
   Further, the CIA students showed significant improvements in their
   attitudes toward mathematics, were less anxious about mathematics, and
   rated their class as more interesting. A higher percentage of students
   successfully completed the CIA course.},

Abstract = {There is a growing theoretical consensus that the concepts of ratio and
   proportion do not develop in isolation. Rather, they are part of the
   individual's multiplicative conceptual field, which includes other
   concepts such as multiplication, division, and rational numbers. The
   current study attempted to clarify the beginning of this developmental
   process. One fifth-grade student, Bruce, was encouraged to schematize
   his trial-and-error-based method, which was effective in solving
   so-called missing-value tasks. This study describes several advancements
   Bruce made during the teaching experiment and analyzes the challenges
   Bruce faced in attempting to schematize his method. Finally, the
   mathematical knowledge Bruce needed to further develop his ratio and
   proportion concepts is identified. The findings provide additional
   support for the view that the development of ratio and proportion
   concepts is embedded within the development of the multiplicative
   conceptual field.},

Abstract = {There has been continuing discussion in the literature as to the effects
   of bilingualism on cognitive tasks. Much of the research has been
   carried out with immigrant students in developed countries. This study
   is set in a developing country and was based on the theoretical work of
   Cummins. Grade 6 students from five urban Community Schools in Papua New
   Guinea completed several mathematics and language tests, a survey form
   eliciting information on home background, and a test of cognitive
   development. The data supported the thesis that students' level of
   competence in their original tongue and in English, the language of
   their regular schooling, were significant influences on mathematical
   performance. In particular these results supported Cummins's threshold
   hypothesis. They also support the notion that bilingualism should not be
   taken as a unidimensional entity, and that allowance should be made for
   its multidimensional nature when carrying out research and when making
   educational decisions.},

Abstract = {Supporting students in making mathematical arguments is an important
   part of discourse practices in mathematics classrooms. Differences in
   teachers' support for collective argumentation have been observed and
   documented, and the importance of the teacher's role in supporting
   collective argumentation is well established. This article seeks to
   explain differences in teachers' support for argumentation by examining
   two student teachers' beliefs about mathematics, teaching, and proof to
   see which beliefs are visible in their support for argumentation.
   Assisted by a framework for argumentation and a commitment to teachers'
   beliefs and actions as sensible systems, we found that teachers' beliefs
   about the role of the teacher, particularly with respect to giving
   explanations, were more visible in their support for collective
   argumentation than other beliefs about mathematics or proof.},

Abstract = {What does it mean to be ``good-at-math,{''} and how is it determined?
   Cobb et al. (2009) defined the normative identity of mathematics
   classrooms as the obligations that students must meet to be considered
   good-at-math. Obligations are negotiated between teachers and students
   through series of bids. Normative identities reveal distributions of
   agency and authority within classrooms, which affect learning
   opportunities for students. Traditionally, mathematics teachers held the
   predominance of agency and authority in classrooms. Research supports
   shifting toward more equitable teaching and learning (e.g., National
   Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2018). Clear examples of enacting
   and supporting changes are helpful. This article shares how sixth-grade
   students and their teacher co-constructed good-at-math to invite and
   obligate students to become active agents in mathematical argumentation.},

Abstract = {We investigated the extent to which one elementary school child with
   working-memory differences made sense of number as a composite unit and
   advanced her reasoning. Through ongoing and retrospective analysis of
   eight teaching-experiment sessions, we uncovered four shifts in the
   child's real-time negotiation of number over time: (a) initial ``2s{''}
   and symmetry to consider counting on, (b) participatory awareness of 10
   and use of algorithmic knowledge, (c) break apart and growing
   anticipation of tacit counting, and (d) advanced participatory tacit
   double counting. The results suggest a possible link between the child's
   participatory knowledge and the extent to which her enacted activity met
   her goals for solving the problem more than her current ``knowing.{''}
   The implications regarding a possible proof of concept toward implicit,
   intensive instruction arc shared.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that although mathematics educators are
   concerned about social issues, minimal attention has been paid to
   student-student interactions outside the classroom. We discuss social
   network analysis as a methodology for studying such interactions in the
   context of an undergraduate course. We present results on the questions:
   Who studies with whom? What are students' study habits, and are these
   systematically related to the habits of those with whom they interact?
   Do individual and collaborative study habits predict attainment? We
   discuss the implications of these findings for research on undergraduate
   learning and on social issues in mathematics education, suggesting that
   social network analysis may provide a bridge between mathematics
   education researchers who focus on cognitive and on social issues.},

Abstract = {This article identifies a self-sustaining system of deficit narratives
   about students of color as an entry point for studies of cognition to
   engage with the sociopolitical context of mathematical learning.
   Principles from sociopolitical perspectives and Critical Race Theory,
   and historical analyses of deficit thinking in education research,
   support the investigation into the system. Using existing research about
   students' understanding of a limit in calculus as context, this article
   proposes a definition of a deficit perspective on sense making and
   unpacks some of its tenets. The data illustration in this article
   focuses on the mathematical sense making of a Chicana undergraduate
   student. The analysis uses an anti-deficit perspective to construct a
   sensemaking counter-story by a woman of color. The counter-story
   challenges existing deficit master-narratives about the mathematical
   ability of women of color. The article closes with a proposal for an
   anti-deficit method for studying the sense making of students of color.},

Abstract = {Equity in mathematics classroom discourse is a pressing concern, but
   analyzing issues of equity using observational tools remains a
   challenge. In this article, we propose equity analytics as a
   quantitative approach to analyzing aspects of equity and inequity in
   classrooms. We introduce a classroom observation tool that focuses on
   relatively low-inference dimensions of classroom discourse, which are
   cross-tabulated with demographic markers (e.g., gender, race) to
   identify patterns of more and less equitable participation within and
   across lessons. We argue that equity analytics can support researchers
   and practitioners in identifying subtle patterns of inequity in
   classroom discourse. As we show, even in classrooms with highly
   experienced, equity-minded teachers, subtle inequities can emerge that
   are detectable through this quantitative methodology. To conclude, we
   discuss how equity analytics can complement qualitative approaches in
   the study of equity and inequity in classrooms.},

Abstract = {An understanding of fractions eludes many U.S. students, and
   research-based knowledge about fractions, such as the utility of linear
   representation, has not broadly influenced instruction. This randomized
   trial of lesson study supported by mathematical resources assigned 39
   educator teams across the United States to locally managed lesson study
   supported by a fractions lesson study resource kit or to 1 of 2 control
   conditions. Educators (87\% of whom were elementary teachers)
   self-managed learning over a 3-month period. HLM analyses indicated
   significantly greater improvement of educators' and students' fractions
   knowledge for teams randomly assigned to lesson study with resource
   kits. Results suggest that integrating research based resources into
   lesson study offers a new approach to the problem of ``scale-up{''} by
   combining the strengths of teacher leadership and research-based
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {In this study, I examined the degree to which experienced teachers were
   aware of the relationship between prior knowledge and new learning.
   Interviews with teachers revealed that they were explicitly aware of
   when students made connections between prior knowledge and new learning,
   when they applied their prior knowledge to new contexts, and when they
   developed their prior knowledge as a result of applying that knowledge
   to new contexts. However, teachers were not explicitly aware of
   backward-transfer effects. Results from this study have implications for
   future research on backward transfer, as well as for teacher
   professional development.},

Abstract = {One crucial question for researchers who study teachers' classroom
   practice is how to maximize information about what is happening in
   classrooms while minimizing costs. This report extends prior studies of
   the reliability of the Instructional Quality Assessment (IQA), a widely
   used classroom observation toolkit, and offers insight into the often
   asked question: ``What is the number of observations required to
   reliably measure a teacher's instructional practice using the IQA?{''}
   We found that in some situations, as few as three observations are
   needed to reliably measure a teacher's instructional practice using the
   IQA. However, that result depends on a variety of other factors.},

   curricula and student postsecondary mathematics performance. The sample
   (N = 4,144 from 266 high schools) was partitioned into 3 strata by ACT
   mathematics scores. Students completing 3 or more years of a
   commercially developed curriculum, the University of Chicago School
   Mathematics Project curriculum, or National Science Foundation-funded
   curriculum comprised the sample. Of interest were comparisons of the
   difficulty level and grade in their initial and subsequent college
   mathematics courses, and the number of mathematics courses completed
   over 8 semesters of college work. In general, high school curriculum was
   not differentially related to the pattern of mathematics grades that
   students earned over time or to the difficulty levels of the students'
   mathematics course-taking patterns. There also was no relationship
   between high school curricula and the number of college mathematics
   courses completed.},

Abstract = {I do not think any thoughtful researcher today believes that experiments
   or randomized field trials are the ``gold standard{''} for addressing
   all the important questions in educational research. Yet, because these
   designs are now required by the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and
   are being strongly encouraged in other federal legislation and funding
   initiatives, scholars, practitioners, parents, and researchers must
   devote time and energy to fighting these designs when they are
   inappropriate or irrelevant, which is often the case. Despite
   long-standing objections from prominent methodologists and reservations
   expressed by national groups and committees, key policymakers in the
   federal government are encouraging the pursuit of experimental designs
   primarily or exclusively (Eisenhart, 2005, p. 246).},

Abstract = {This article is about 8 African American middle school boys who have
   experienced Success in mathematics. Working within a phenomenological
   methodological framework, the researcher investigated the limitations
   these students encounter and the compensating factors they experience.
   Critical race theory was the theoretical framework for this Study,
   counter-storytelling was utilized to capture the boys' experiences,
   which is in stark contrast to the dominant literature concerning African
   American males and mathematics. Five themes emerged from the data: (a)
   early educational experiences, (b) recognition of abilities and how it
   was achieved, (c) support systems, (d) positive mathematical and
   academic identity, and (c) alternative identities.},

Abstract = {In this experimental study, prospective elementary school teachers
   enrolled in a mathematics course were randomly assigned to (a)
   concurrently learn about children's mathematical thinking by watching
   children on video or working directly with children, (b) concurrently
   visit elementary school classrooms of conveniently located or specially
   selected teachers, or (c) a control group. Those who studied children's
   mathematical thinking while learning mathematics developed more
   sophisticated beliefs about mathematics, teaching, and teaming and
   improved their mathematical content knowledge more than those who did
   not. Furthermore, beliefs of those who observed in conveniently located
   classrooms underwent less change than the beliefs of those in the other
   groups, including those in the control group. Implications for assessing
   teachers' beliefs and for providing appropriate experiences for
   prospective teachers are discussed.},

Abstract = {Monitoring educational changes over many years is problematic when there
   are differences in curricula, the nature of the variables being
   measured, and the selection of participants. Rasch measurement
   techniques provide a procedure that enables each of these issues to be
   examined. Using archived and specially collected data, tests of numeracy
   undertaken in Tasmania over a 20-year period, from 1978 to 1997, were
   equated and mapped onto the same continuum through a combination of
   common item and common person equating. Examination of fit to the model
   showed that the nature of the measured construct had not changed over
   this period. Although test difficulty appears to have risen over the
   period, student achievement was relatively unchanged. The implications
   of these findings for longitudinal studies of achievement are discussed.},

Abstract = {Mathematics teachers and educational researchers ordered arithmetic and
   algebra problems according to their predicted problem-solving difficulty
   for students. Predictions deviated systematically from algebra students'
   performances but closely matched a view implicit in textbooks. Analysis
   of students' problem-solving strategies indicates specific ways that
   students' algebraic reasoning differs from that predicted by most
   teachers and researchers in the sample and portrayed in common
   textbooks. The Symbol Precedence Model of development of algebraic
   reasoning, in which symbolic problem solving precedes verbal problem
   solving and arithmetic skills strictly precede algebraic skills, was
   contrasted with the Verbal Precedence Model of development, which
   provided a better quantitative fit of students' performance data.
   Implications of the findings for student and reacher cognition and for
   algebra instruction are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this article I present and discuss an attempt to promote development
   of prospective elementary teachers' own subject-matter knowledge of
   division of fractions as well as their awareness of the nature and the
   likely sources of related common misconceptions held by children. My
   data indicate that before the mathematics methods course described here
   most participants knew how to divide fractions but could not explain the
   procedure. The prospective teachers were unaware of major sources of
   students' incorrect responses in this domain. One conclusion is that
   teacher education programs should attempt to familiarize prospective
   teachers with common, sometimes erroneous, cognitive processes used by
   students in dividing fractions and the effects of use of such processes.},

Abstract = {In this mete-analysis I examined 26 studies on the relationship between
   anxiety toward mathematics and achievement in mathematics among
   elementary and secondary students. The common population correlation for
   the relationship is significant (-.27). A series of general linear
   models indicated that the relationship is consistent across gender
   groups, grade-level groups, ethnic groups, instruments measuring
   anxiety, and years of publication. The relationship, however, differs
   significantly among instruments measuring achievement as well as among
   types of publication. Researchers using standardized achievement tests
   tend to report a relationship of significantly smaller magnitude than
   researchers using mathematics teachers' grades and researcher-made
   achieve ment tests. Published studies tend to indicate a significantly
   smaller magnitude of the relationship than unpublished studies. There
   are no significant interaction effects among key variables such as
   gender, grade, and ethnicity.},

Abstract = {We investigated criteria preschool children use to distinguish members
   of a class of shapes from other figures. We conducted individual
   clinical interviews of 97 children ages 3 to 6, emphasizing
   identification and descriptions of shapes and reasons for these
   identifications. We found that young children initially form schemas on
   the basis of feature analysis of visual forms. While these schemas are
   developing, children continue to rely primarily on visual matching to
   distinguish shapes. They are, however, also capable of recognizing
   components and simple properties of familiar shapes. Thus, evidence
   supports previous claims (Clements \& Battista, 1992b) that a
   prerecognitive level exists before van Hiele Level 1 ({''}visual
   level{''}) and that Level I should be reconceptualized as syncretic
   (i.e., a synthesis of verbal declarative and imagistic knowledge, each
   interacting with the other) instead of visual (Clements, 1992).},

Abstract = {Recent research has convincingly documented elementary school children's
   tendency to neglect real-world knowledge and realistic considerations
   during mathematical modeling of word problems in school arithmetic. The
   present article describes the design and the results of an exploratory
   teaching experiment carried out to test the hypothesis that it is
   feasible to develop in pupils a disposition toward (more) realistic
   mathematical modeling. This goal is achieved by immersing them in a
   classroom culture in which word problems are conceived as exercises in
   mathematical modeling, with a focus on the assumptions and the
   appropriateness of the model underlying any proposed solution. The
   learning and transfer effects of an experimental class of 10- and
   11-year-old pupils - compared to the results in two control
   classes-provide support for the hypothesis that it is possible to
   develop in elementary school pupils a disposition toward (more)
   realistic mathematical modeling.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to investigate the evolution, with age,
   of probabilistic, intuitively based misconceptions. We hypothesized, on
   the basis of previous research with infinity concepts, that these
   misconceptions would stabilize during the emergence of the formal
   operation period. The responses to probability problems of students in
   Grades 5, 7, 9, and 11 and of prospective teachers indicated, contrary
   to our hypothesis, that some misconceptions grew stronger with age,
   whereas others grew weaker. Only one misconception investigated was
   stable across ages. An attempt was made to find a theoretical
   explanation for this rather strange and complex situation.},

Title = {THE FREQUENCY OF ARITHMETIC FACTS IN ELEMENTARY TEXTS - ADDITION AND

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {tabulated the frequency with which simple addition and multiplication
   facts occur in elementary school arithmetic texts for grades 1-6. The
   results indicated a strong `'small-fact bias'' in both addition and
   multiplication. `'Large'' facts, with operands larger than 5, occurred
   up to half as frequently as those with operands in the 2-5 range. As was
   also found in an earlier tabulation for grades K-3, facts with operands
   of 0 and 1 occurred relatively infrequently; the ostensible exceptions
   to this pattern, high frequencies for combinations like 1 + 2 and 1 x 3,
   were caused by the small-fact bias in multicolumn problems. The
   small-fact bias in the presentation of basic arithmetic at least to the
   degree observed here, probably works against a basic pedagogical goal
   mastery of simple arithmetic. It may also provide a partial explanation
   of the widely reported problem size or problem difficulty effect, that
   children's and adults' responses to larger basic facts are both slower
   and more error prone than their solutions to smaller facts. Theoretical
   and practical implications of the small-fact bias are discussed briefly.},

Abstract = {The ubiquitousness and robustness of traditional practices in the
   teaching of school mathematics raise two fundamental and interrelated
   questions: Will the fate of the current reform effort in mathematics
   education be any different from that of previous reform efforts? Why
   have these traditional practices been so constant and durable? Certainly
   these are questions that cannot be answered in a single study. However,
   in an effort to develop a research basis that could aid in thinking
   about these questions, I conducted an ethnographic case study of a
   beginning high school mathematics teacher's acculturation into the
   school mathematics tradition (i.e., the beliefs and practices that
   characterize the traditional approach to school mathematics). The
   analysis presented here focuses on the tensions and contradictions that
   underlie the beliefs and practices of the school mathematics tradition
   and on the ways that teachers cope with these tensions and
   contradictions. It also indicates how the explanations and strategies
   that teachers employ to cope with these tensions and contradictions on
   actually help to sustain the tradition.},

Abstract = {We use a narrative framework to investigate how mathematics textbook
   lessons can promote sustained student inquiry. Our analysis of four high
   school textbook lessons on the SSA congruence property, three of which
   contain explorations, reveals how explorations can promote
   problem-solving perseverance by inspiring readers to raise mathematical
   questions and by keeping these questions open throughout significant
   portions of the lesson. Furthermore, student curiosity and anticipation
   can be enhanced through ambiguity. Stark structural differences exist
   among lessons with explorations, suggesting that explorations are not
   necessarily supportive of sustained student inquiry. These insights not
   only enable educators to learn whether and how a lesson encourages
   inquiry but also support the design of new curricular materials aligned
   with the goals of reform.},

Abstract = {Building on the work of Professional Noticing of Children's Mathematical
   Thinking, we introduce the Curricular Noticing Framework to describe how
   teachers recognize opportunities within curriculum materials, understand
   their affordances and limitations, and use strategies to act on them.
   This framework builds on Remillard's (2005) notion of participation with
   curriculum materials, connects with and broadens existing research on
   the relationship between teachers and written curriculum, and highlights
   new areas for research. We argue that once mathematics educators better
   understand the strategic curricular practices that support ambitious
   teaching, which we refer to as professional curricular noticing, such
   knowledge could lead to recommendations for how to support the
   curricular work of teachers and novice teachers in particular.},

Abstract = {This study addresses a longstanding question among high school
   mathematics teachers and college mathematics professors: Which is the
   best preparation for college calculus-(a) a high level of mastery of
   mathematics considered preparatory for calculus (algebra, geometry,
   precalculus) or (b) taking calculus itself in high school? We used a
   data set of 6,207 students of 216 professors at 133 randomly selected
   U.S. colleges and universities, and hierarchical models controlled for
   differences in demography and background. Mastery of the mathematics
   considered preparatory for calculus was found to have more than double
   the impact of taking a high school calculus course on students' later
   performance in college calculus, on average. However, students with
   weaker mathematics preparation gained the most from taking high school
   calculus.},

Abstract = {This study (n = 1,044) used data from the Teacher Education and
   Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M) to examine the relationship
   between field experience focus (instruction- or exploration-focused),
   duration, and timing (early or not) and prospective elementary teachers'
   intertwined knowledge and beliefs about mathematics and mathematics
   learning. Early instruction-focused field experience (i.e., leading
   directly to classroom instruction) was positively related to the study
   outcomes in programs with such field experience of median or shorter
   duration. Moreover, the duration of instruction-focused field experience
   was positively related to study outcomes in programs without early
   instruction-focused field experience. By contrast, the duration of
   exploration-focused field experience (e.g., observation) was not related
   to the study outcomes. These findings suggest that field experience has
   important but largely overlooked relationships with prospective
   teachers' mathematical knowledge and beliefs. Implications for future
   research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Graduate teaching assistants serve as instructors of record for numerous
   undergraduate courses every semester, including serving as teachers for
   mathematics content courses for elementary preservice teachers. In this
   study, we examine 6 teaching assistants' teaching practices in the
   context of a geometry content course for preservice teachers by focusing
   on their enactment of reasoning-and-proving tasks. Results indicate that
   teaching assistants engaged preservice teachers in a variety of
   reasoning-and-proving activities. For 42 of 82 tasks observed,
   preservice teachers' engagement in reasoning and -proving processes
   decreased relative to the potential for reasoning and proving in
   mathematical tasks. This investigation into teaching assistants'
   teaching practices identifies factors associated with their enactment of
   reasoning-and-proving tasks (e.g., generating student participation).
   This research has implications for professional development to support
   college mathematics instructors' teaching.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of a mathematics software program, the
   Building Blocks software suite, on young children's mathematics
   performance. Participants included 247 Kindergartners from 37 classrooms
   in 9 schools located in low-income communities. Children within
   classrooms were randomly assigned to receive 21 weeks of
   computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in mathematics with Building Blocks
   or in literacy with Earobics Step 1. Children in the Building Blocks
   condition evidenced higher posttest scores on tests of numeracy and
   Applied Problems after controlling for beginning-of-year numeracy scores
   and classroom nesting. These findings, together with a review of earlier
   CAI, provide guidance for future work on CAI aiming to improve
   mathematics performance of children from low-income backgrounds.},

Abstract = {Overall scale scores from the National Assessment of Educational
   Progress (NAEP) indicate that there was only minimal improvement in the
   mathematics performance of high school students between 1978 and 2004.
   Using recently released data from the Long-Term Trend (LTT) NAEP, this
   study describes the content covered on the LTT NAEP and the performance
   of 17-year-old students on that content. In addition, it demonstrates
   that although overall gains in performance were small, there were areas
   within mathematics in which performance improved substantially and
   others in which students in 2004 did not do as well as their
   counterparts of the 1970s and 1980s. Specifically, performance on 3
   items involving multiplication of whole numbers by fractions
   deteriorated but performance improved on most tasks involving percents
   and geometry. Performance was stable on most items assessing algebraic
   reasoning and logical reasoning and was stable or improved modestly on
   items assessing estimation, interpretation of tables and graphs, and
   understanding of integers.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the efficacy of a preschool mathematics program
   based on a comprehensive model of developing research-based software and
   print curricula. Building Blocks, funded by the National Science
   Foundation, is a curriculum development project focused on creating
   research-based, technology-enhanced mathematics materials for pre-K
   through grade 2. In this article, we describe the underlying principles,
   development, and initial summative evaluation of the first set of
   resulting materials as they were used in classrooms with children at
   risk for later school failure. Experimental and comparison classrooms
   included two principal types of public preschool programs serving
   low-income families: state funded and Head Start prekindergarten
   programs. The experimental treatment group score increased significantly
   more than the comparison group score; achievement gains of the
   experimental group approached the sought-after 2-sigma effect of
   individual tutoring. This study contributes to research showing that
   focused early mathematical interventions help young children develop a
   foundation of informal mathematics knowledge, especially for children at
   risk for later school failure.},

Abstract = {This Brief Report describes a secondary analysis of the solutions
   written by 306 second-year algebra students to four constructed-response
   items representative of content at this level. The type of solution
   (symbolic, graphical, or numerical) used most frequently varied by item.
   Curriculum effects were observed. Students studying from the second
   edition of the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project's
   (UCSMP) Advanced Algebra curriculum used a higher percentage of
   graphical and numerical strategies than comparison students. Achievement
   and choice of strategy were also related. Both UCSMP and non-UCSMP
   students who used symbolic or graphing strategies were generally
   successful on the quadratic comparison item; UCSMP students who used
   graphing strategies were also successful on items dealing with logarithm
   properties and a quadratic application.},

Abstract = {This study had two purposes: (a) to investigate the developmental
   relationship between students' uses of fractions notation and their
   understandings of part-whole relations; and (b) to produce an analysis
   of the role of fractions instruction in students' use of notation to
   represent parts of an area. Elementary students (n = 384) in 19 classes
   participated in the study. Pre- and posttests were administered before
   and after fractions instruction, and key lessons were recorded with
   videotape and field notes. Students' written responses were coded in two
   ways: for the forms of the notations (e.g., use of numerator,
   denominator, and separation line), and for the concepts captured by the
   notations (e.g., part-whole, part-part, or other kinds of relations).
   The lessons captured on videotapes and in field notes were rated with
   respect to their alignment with principles supported by reform
   frameworks in mathematics education (e.g., opportunity to build
   understanding of fractions concepts, ongoing assessment of student
   understanding). Our analyses indicated (a) notation and reference were
   acquired somewhat independently, and (b) classroom practices that built
   on students' thinking were more likely to support shifts toward
   normative uses of notation.},

Abstract = {Students' strategies for solving long division problems under a
   realistic mathematics approach (RME) at Dutch primary schools were
   categorized in two ways: (a) according to the level of how students
   created multiples of the divisor (chunking) to be subtracted from the
   dividend; and (b) according to their use, or nonuse, of schematic
   notation. These categories could be quantified on two dimensions: use of
   schematization and use of number relations. Just after the introduction
   of long division problems, students' strategies varied from no-chunking
   to high-level chunking. Five months later, this variation of strategies
   was reduced to mainly high-level chunking using a scheme. However,
   strategy development depended on students' prerequisite knowledge and
   the type of textbook used. The results from this study contribute to the
   efficacy of RME for the advancement of strategies and achievement in the
   domain of division.},

Abstract = {This article, the focus of which is on girls in mathematics, engages
   poststructural debates over knowledge and power to explore how female
   subjectivity is lived within the classroom, and the first section looks
   at some recent feminist reconstructionists, proposals developed from the
   idea of ``different experience.{''} The second section is set within the
   context of the poststructuralists' undermining of the ``light{''} of
   progressive development, central to the Enlightenment project.
   Foucauldian ideas are introduced for a theoretical discussion about the
   ways in which the girl becomes gendered through available discourses and
   practices. Building on this discussion, the third section provides an
   analysis of some moments of classroom life and offers a different story
   about girls in school mathematics.},

Abstract = {This study deals with students' construction of mathematical objects.
   The basic claim is that the need for communication-any attempt to evoke
   certain actions by others-is the primary driving force behind all human
   cognitive processes. Effectiveness of verbal communication is seen as a
   function of the quality of its focus. Material objects may serve as a
   basis fur creation of such a focus, but in some discourses,
   focus-engendering objects must be created. Such discursive construction
   is observed in analysis of one classroom episode, Special attention is
   given to metaphor, which is the point of departure for the construction
   process, and to the subsequent dialectical process of closing the gap
   between the metaphor-induced expectations and the need for a
   well-defined construction procedure to ensure effective communication.},
