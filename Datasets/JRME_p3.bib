Abstract = {This study examines the impact of a nationally disseminated professional
   development program, Developing Mathematical Ideas (DMI), on teachers'
   specialized knowledge for teaching mathematics and illustrates how such
   research could be conducted. Participants completing 2 DMI modules were
   compared with similar colleagues who had not taken DMI. Teacher
   knowledge was measured with multiple-choice items developed by the
   Learning Mathematics for Teaching project and open-ended items based on
   problems initially developed by DMI experts. After controlling for
   pretest scores, a hierarchical linear model identified statistically
   significant differences: The DMI group outperformed the comparison group
   on both assessments. Gains in teachers' scores on the more closely
   aligned measure were related to the degree of facilitator experience
   with DMI. This study adds to our understanding of the ways in which
   professional development program features, facilitators, and issues of
   scale interact in the development of teachers' mathematical knowledge
   for teaching. Study limitations and challenges are discussed.},

Abstract = {Using case study analysis and a cognitive theoretical orientation, we
   examine elements of knowledge for teaching needed by a mathematician to
   orchestrate whole-class discussions in an undergraduate mathematics
   classroom. The instructor, an experienced teacher and mathematics
   researcher, used an inquiry-oriented curriculum to teach a differential
   equations course for the first time after teaching it with traditional
   lecture methods for many years. Examples of classroom teaching and
   interview data demonstrate that, despite having extensive teaching
   experience and possessing strong content knowledge, some instructors may
   still face challenges when trying to provide analytic scaffolding to
   move whole-class discussions toward a lesson's mathematical goals. We
   also hypothesize several component practices necessary for the
   successful use of analytic scaffolding. Our analysis focuses on the
   relationship between the instructor's pedagogical content knowledge and
   specialized content knowledge and his capacity to enact these component
   practices during whole-class discussions.},

Abstract = {Recent research on mathematics reforms in the United States indicates
   that the reforms are not yet widely implemented. Generally, this claim
   results from looking at the extent to which teachers use curricular
   materials or engage in particular classroom practices. This article
   moves beyond disparate questions of use and practice to examine
   interactions between teachers and curricula as evidenced by their
   enactments of whole-number lessons from a Standards-based curriculum.
   Specifically, we analyze videorecorded 1st- and 2nd-grade classroom
   lessons in terms of students' opportunities to reason and communicate
   about mathematics. This analysis indicates that the level of fidelity to
   the written curriculum differs from the level of fidelity to the
   authors' intended curriculum during lesson enactments. Drawing on this
   analysis, this article explores how curricula support and hinder
   teachers as they engage students in opportunities to learn mathematics
   and how teachers' instructional moves and choices impact the enactment
   of curricula.},

Abstract = {This article reports on an investigation of how teachers of geometry
   perceived an episode of instruction presented to them as a case of
   engaging students in proving. Confirming what was hypothesized,
   participants found it remarkable that a teacher would allow a student to
   make an assumption while proving. But they perceived this episode in
   various ways, casting the episode as one of as many as 10 different
   stories. Those different castings of the episode make use of
   intellectual resources for professional practice that practitioners
   could use to negotiate the norms of a situation in which they had made a
   tactical but problematic move. This collection of stories attests to the
   effectiveness of the technique used for eliciting the rationality of
   mathematics teaching: By confronting practitioners with episodes of
   teaching in which some norms have been breached, one can learn about the
   rationality underlying the norms of customary teaching.},

Abstract = {This article examines 3 models for developing and analyzing culturally
   responsive teaching in mathematics teacher education. The models were
   developed from and arc illustrated by findings from a series of
   exploratory research studies conducted to evaluate various methods for
   preparing preservice teachers to address the educational implications of
   bicultural partnership between indigenous Maori and New Zealand European
   groups. The studies explored the perceptions of preservice and beginning
   teachers regarding the incorporation of cultural approaches in the
   teaching of mathematics. The implications of our research regarding the
   challenges of representing cultural perspectives in mathematics
   education are discussed in the context of the broader literature on
   culturally responsive education.},

Abstract = {This article reports on models of teaching that developed as outgrowths
   of a study of middle-grades mathematics classes. Grounded theory
   methodology and sociolinguistic tools were used to move from classroom
   observations and interviews to line-by-line coding of classroom
   discourse, to mapping the flow of talk and verbal assessment moves, to a
   multilevel analysis of the relationships of forms of talk and verbal
   assessment, and, ultimately, to models of teaching that promote
   discourse on a continuum from univocal (conveying meaning) to dialogic
   (constructing meaning through dialogue). Three specific cases are
   highlighted that represent deductive (associated with univocal),
   inductive (associated with dialogic), and mixed (a hybrid of deductive
   and inductive) models of teaching. Teaching practices associated with
   each model are illustrated and discussed.},

Abstract = {There is widespread agreement that effective teachers have unique
   knowledge of students' mathematical ideas and thinking. However, few
   scholars have focused on conceptualizing this domain, and even fewer
   have focused on measuring this knowledge. In this article, we describe
   an effort to conceptualize and develop measures of teachers' combined
   knowledge of content and students by writing, piloting, and analyzing
   results from multiple-choice items. Our results suggest partial success
   in measuring this domain among practicing teachers but also identify key
   areas around which the field must achieve conceptual and empirical
   clarity. Although this is ongoing work, we believe that the lessons
   learned from our efforts shed light on teachers' knowledge in this
   domain and can inform future attempts to develop measures.},

Abstract = {In this article, I used a discourse analytic framework to examine the
   ``voice{''} of a middle school mathematics unit. I attended to the
   text's voice, which helped to illuminate the construction of the roles
   of the authors and readers and the expected relationships between them.
   The discursive framework I used focused my attention on particular
   language forms. The aim of the analysis was to see whether the authors
   of the unit achieved the ideological goal (i.e., the intended
   curriculum) put forth by the NCTM's Standards (1991) to shift the locus
   of authority away from the teacher and the textbook and toward student
   mathematical reasoning and justification. The findings indicate that
   achieving this goal is more difficult than the authors of the Standards
   documents may have realized and that there may be a mismatch between
   this goal and conventional textbook forms.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {To investigate mechanisms of failure in mathematics, we adopt the
   communicational approach to cognition, which describes thinking as an
   activity of communication and learning mathematics as an initiation to a
   certain type of discourse. In the search for factors that impede
   students' participation in arithmetic communication, we examine the
   arithmetical discourses of two 18-year-old girls with long histories of
   learning difficulties. The resulting arithmetical discourse profiles of
   the two students help us substantiate the following two claims: (1)
   Almost any person may become a skillful participant of arithmetical
   discourse, provided, first, that a discursive mode is found that makes
   the best of this person's special strengths and second, that in the
   process of teaching, the general sociocultural context of learning is
   taken into account as having a central role in enabling or barring one's
   access to literate discourses; (2) if the potential for successful
   participation remains often unrealized, it is mainly because of certain
   widely practiced abuses of literate mathematical discourse.},

Title = {A comparative study of children's out-of-school activities and

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-150},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The study reported in this article examined relations between ethnicity,
   out-of-school activities, and arithmetical achievements in Latin
   American and Korean American children in first, second, and third
   grades. Three types of data were collected: parents' educational
   attitudes and beliefs, parents' reports of children's everyday
   activities with arithmetic and money, and children's performance on
   arithmetic tasks. Few differences emerged in parents' attitudes about
   education, although their reports revealed differences in children's
   out-of-school activities, with Latin American children more often
   engaged in instrumental activities with money, and Korean American
   children more often engaged in activities intended to support their
   school learning. Children's performances on arithmetic tasks mirrored
   their engagement in out-of-school activities: Latin American children
   solved correctly more tasks with money than denominational chips, and
   Korean American children solved correctly more tasks with chips than
   money. The results are discussed with respect to understanding
   connections between culture and children's developing mathematical
   understanding, and creating culturally relevant school instruction that
   builds on students' informal mathematics knowledge.},

Abstract = {One hundred eight students in Grades 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 were asked about
   their beliefs concerning fairness of dice before being presented with a
   few dice (at least one of which was ``loaded{''}) and asked to determine
   whether each die was fair. Four levels of beliefs about fairness and
   four levels of strategies for determining fairness were identified.
   Although there were structural similarities in the levels of response,
   the association between beliefs and strategies was not strong. Three or
   four years later, we interviewed 44 of these students again using the
   same protocol. Changes and consistencies in levels of response were
   noted for beliefs and strategies. The association of beliefs and
   strategies was similar after three or four years. We discuss future
   research and educational implications in terms of assumptions that are
   often made about students' understanding of fairness of dice, both prior
   to and after experimentation.},

Abstract = {Sixty Japanese children between the ages of 3 years 4 months and 7 years
   5 months were individually interviewed to investigate the relationship
   between their levels of abstraction (as assessed by a task involving
   conservation of number) and their levels of representation (as assessed
   by a task asking for their graphic representation of small groups of
   objects). The investigation concluded that abstraction and
   representation are closely related and that children can represent at or
   below their level of abstraction but not above this level. The
   educational implication is that educators need to focus more on the
   mental relationships children make (i.e., their abstraction) because the
   meaning children can give to conventional symbols depends on their level
   of abstraction.},

Abstract = {This study uses repertory grid methodology together with a predicational
   view of human thinking to describe the informal models of the limit
   concept held by two college calculus students. It describes how their
   models, based on iteratively choosing points that get closer to the
   limiting value, are affected by experimental sessions designed to alter
   them. The informal models are based on the notion of actual infinity,
   which poses a severe cognitive obstacle to the learning of the formal
   definition of limit. The study also suggests that the predicational view
   of cognition, together with analysis of repertory grid data based on
   fuzzy set theory, can be useful in studying students' concept images of
   advanced mathematical concepts.},

Abstract = {After surveying high-attaining 14- and 15-year-old students about proof
   in algebra, we found that students simultaneously held 2 different
   conceptions of proof: those about arguments they considered would
   receive the best mark and those about arguments they would adopt for
   themselves. In the former category, algebraic arguments were popular. In
   the latter, students preferred arguments that they could evaluate and
   that they found convincing and explanatory, preferences that excluded
   algebra. Empirical argument predominated in students' own proof
   constructions, although most students were aware of its limitations. The
   most successful students presented proofs in everyday language, not
   using algebra. Students' responses were influenced mainly by their
   mathematical competence but also by curricular factors, their views of
   proof, and their genders.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate and document possibilities
   for and manifestations of collaborative work with pairs of kindergarten
   students while they worked on tasks designed to promote early number
   development. Ten students. paired to be compatible with respect to their
   development of counting, were taught weekly for a period of 4 months.
   The students were addressed as pairs and provided with only one set of
   counting materials. The students generated 4 strategies to organize
   their counting: counting parts side by ride, counting all at the same
   time, taking turns, and counting cooperatively. Cooperative counting was
   defined as a counting episode in which the counting acts of both
   students merged into a single activity with the partners working toward
   a common goal. Three themes emerged from the analysis of the cooperative
   solutions: (a) the relation between cooperation and the specific
   requirements of a counting task, (b) the relation between the ability to
   work cooperatively and the students' development of counting, and (c)
   the students' need to complement a cooperative venture with a solution
   of their own.},

Abstract = {In this study, 53 middle school teachers and 28 prospective secondary
   school teachers worked either individually or in pairs to pose
   mathematical problems associated with a reasonably complex task setting,
   before and during or after attempting to solve a problem within that
   task setting. Written responses were examined to determine the kinds of
   problems posed in this task setting, to make inferences about cognitive
   processes used to generate the problems, and to examine differences
   between problems posed prior to solving the problem and those posed
   during or after solving. Although some responses were ill-posed or
   poorly stated problems, subjects generated a large number of reasonable
   problems during both problem-posing phases, thereby suggesting that
   these teachers and prospective teachers had some personal capacity for
   mathematical problem posing. Subjects posed problems using both
   affirming and negating processes; that is, not only by generating goal
   statements while keeping problem constraints fixed but also by
   manipulating the task's implicit assumptions and initial conditions. A
   sizable portion of the posed problems were produced in clusters of
   related problems, thereby suggesting systematic problem generation.
   Subjects posed more problems before problem solving than during or after
   problem solving, and they tended to shift the focus of their posing
   between posing phases based at least in part on the intervening
   problem-solving experience. Moreover, the posed problems were not always
   ones that subjects could solve, nor were they always problems with
   `'nice'' mathematical solutions.},

Title = {Intersubjectivity in mathematics learning: A challenge to the radical

Abstract = {Radical constructivism is currently a major, if not the dominant,
   theoretical orientation in the mathematics education community, in
   relation to children's learning. There are, however, aspects of
   children's learning that are challenges to this perspective, and what
   appears to be `'at least temporary states of intersubjectivity'' (Cobb,
   Wood, \& Yackel, 1991, p. 162) in the classroom is one such challenge.
   In this paper I discuss intersubjectivity and through it offer an
   examination of the limitations of the radical constructivist
   perspective. I suggest that the extension of radical constructivism
   toward a social constructivism, in an attempt to incorporate
   intersubjectivity, leads to an incoherent theory of learning. A
   comparison of Piaget's positioning of the individual in relation to
   social life with that of Vygotsky and his followers is offered, in
   support of the claim that radical constructivism does not offer enough
   as an explanation of children's learning of mathematics.},

Abstract = {Many have argued for the importance of numeracy, yet little is known
   about the opportunities for numeracy presented to people in their daily
   lives.  In this study, we analyzed and compared the characteristics of
   rational numbers in magazines written for children, teenagers, and
   adults.  Our analysis indicates that difficult mathematical concepts
   that appear in the media, such as fractions, percents, and averages, are
   much more prevalent in adults' magazines than in those written for
   children and teenagers.  Adults are often presented with rational
   numbers that are related to each other.  Numbers in teenagers' texts do
   not appear to form a transition to those found in adults' texts, despite
   the fact that through formal schooling teenagers have covered all the
   mathematical concepts that are frequently found in adults' texts. 
   Implications for preparing students for the numeracy demands of everyday
   life are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this paper we consider the duality between process and concept in
   mathematics, in particular, using the same symbolism to represent both a
   process (such as the addition of two numbers 3 + 2) and the product of
   that process (the sum 3 + 2). The ambiguity of notation allows the
   successful thinker the flexibility in thought to move between the
   process to carry out a mathematical task and the concept to be mentally
   manipulated as part of a wider mental schema. Symbolism that inherently
   represents the amalgam of process/concept ambiguity we call a
   `'procept.'' We hypothesize that the successful mathematical thinker
   uses a mental structure that is manifest in the ability to think
   proceptually. We give empirical evidence from simple arithmetic to
   support the hypothesis that there is a qualitatively different kind of
   mathematical thought displayed by the more able thinker compared to that
   of the less able one. The less able are doing a more difficult form of
   mathematics, which eventually causes a divergence in performance between
   them and their more successful peers.},

Abstract = {A longitudinal teaching experiment was conducted with six third graders
   to analyze the itinerary of their ways of operating while solving
   fraction tasks. These children's quantitative reasoning with fractions
   was based on their quantitative reasoning with natural numbers. They
   solved fraction tasks in similar ways, though with different degrees of
   sophistication, depending on their sophistication in working with
   natural numbers. Their consistent method of operating indicated that
   they constructed fraction schemes that had the characteristic of being
   developmental, in the sense that prior schemes were the cornerstones of
   new ones. This article presents the constructive itinerary of one of the
   most advanced children in the group, Michael.},

Volume = {24},

Pages = {442-459},

Abstract = {This paper illustrates the use of rule space as a tool to support
   cognitive analyses of students' mathematical behavior. The rule-space
   approach is explained and is then used to classify students into one of
   two methods for solving linear algebraic equations in one unknown and to
   diagnose their knowledge states in this topic. A 32-item test with
   open-ended questions was administered to 231 eighth and ninth graders.
   Two outcomes of the rule-space model are presented: (a) a classification
   of examinees into knowledge states resulting from the two solution
   approaches at the group level along with individual examples and (b)
   tree diagrams of the transitional relationships among the states for
   each strategy. Implications for using the feedback provided by the
   rule-space model in the context of instruction and assessment are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {We conduct a critical review to explore how research on mathematics
   classroom assessment has positioned students (127 studies, 2015-2020).
   Our analysis shows how research has positioned students as passive
   recipients of assessment by portraying assessment through discourses of
   measurement and cognition. Conversely, students are positioned as active
   agents in their own learning through discourses of empowerment and
   monitoring. Finally, a discourse of performativity portrays classroom
   assessment as a way to promote results in large-scale assessments. These
   five discourses summarize how research produces knowledge about
   mathematics assessment and, in doing so, positions students as social
   agents with certain roles and responsibilities. Our review challenges
   assessment research communities to rethink how students are positioned
   in mathematics assessment.},

Abstract = {This Research Commentary draws on the articles in the March 2022 issue
   of JRME, engaging with the notion of labor as a key concept to push the
   field toward novel understandings of equity in mathematics education. We
   introduce the concepts of identity work and racialized emotions to
   provide an alternative reading of the articles in that issue, arguing
   that attention to the interplay of these two concepts is vital to
   consider issues of equity because mathematics identity intersects with
   race, gender, class, and sexuality, among other social identities
   historically marginalized in the classroom. We argue that a focus on
   such interplay could help to revitalize the discourse on equity in
   mathematics education across the globe.},

Abstract = {Combinatorial proof serves both as an important topic in combinatorics
   and as a type of proof with certain properties and constraints. We
   report on a teaching experiment in which undergraduate students (who
   were novice provers) engaged in combinatorial reasoning as they proved
   binomial identities. We highlight ways of understanding that were
   important for their success with establishing combinatorial arguments;
   in particular, the students demonstrated referential symbolic reasoning
   within an enumerative representation system, and as the students engaged
   in successful combinatorial proof, they had to coordinate reasoning
   within algebraic and enumerative representation systems. We illuminate
   features of the students' work that potentially contributed to their
   successes and highlight potential issues that students may face when
   working with binomial identities.},

Title = {The Culture of Exclusion in Mathematics Education and Its Persistence in

Abstract = {In this article, I investigate the influence of the dominant culture
   characterizing mathematics education-which I term the culture of
   exclusion-on efforts to teach for equity. Analyzing a year of
   observations in an urban high school mathematics department, I found
   that this culture structured everyday instruction even for teachers who
   expressed strong commitment to equity and who participated in ongoing
   equity oriented professional development. Through their classroom
   practice, the 4 focal teachers in this study often framed mathematics as
   a fixed body of knowledge to be received, and they positioned students
   as deficient, unintentionally excluding many students from rich learning
   opportunities. However, these teachers also asserted alternatives to the
   culture of exclusion, showing how resistance to this culture might take
   shape in everyday mathematics instruction.},

Abstract = {This study examines how collective activity related to multiplication
   evolved over several class sessions in an elementary mathematics content
   course that was designed to foster prospective elementary teachers'
   number-sense development. We document how the class drew on as-if-shared
   ideas to make sense of multidigit multiplication in terms of partial
   products and to reason flexibly about products. We document how the
   class overcame the challenge of accounting for partial products in
   multidigit multiplication, including particular activities and ways of
   reasoning that facilitated progress. The results provide insights into
   how prospective elementary teachers' understanding of multidigit
   multiplication can develop during a content course and how a sequence of
   instructional activities and practices can productively leverage the
   resources that they bring in support of that development.},

Abstract = {As part of a dramatic recent shift in tertiary education, many
   undergraduate students now learn mathematics via fully online courses.
   At present, the mathematics education research community knows very
   little about this shift, and in this report, we consider implications of
   an investigation into the instructor experience of fully online
   undergraduate mathematics courses. To compare instructor experiences of
   fully online and face-to-face teaching, we explored assessment schemes,
   feedback processes, and approaches to teaching using a survey and
   semistructured interviews. The main emergent theme was instructor
   concern about the loss of short-cycle face-to-face human interaction. We
   argue that this concern is serious but should be seen as an opportunity
   for education researchers to leverage knowledge about effective
   mathematics teaching to simultaneously alleviate instructors'
   difficulties and promote and study pedagogical development.},

Abstract = {Given the prominence of group work in mathematics education policy and
   curricular materials, it is important to understand how students make
   sense of mathematics during group work. We applied techniques from
   Systemic Functional Linguistics to examine how students positioned
   themselves during group work on a novel task in Algebra II classes. We
   examined the patterns of positioning that students demonstrated during
   group work and how students' positioning moves related to the ways they
   established the resources, operations, and product of a task. Students
   who frequently repositioned themselves created opportunities for
   mathematical reasoning by attending to the resources and operations
   necessary for completing the task. The findings of this study suggest
   how students' positioning and mathematical reasoning are intertwined and
   jointly support collaborative learning through work on novel tasks.},

Abstract = {Critical scholars have argued that mathematics education is in danger of
   becoming increasingly influenced by and aligned with neoliberal and
   neoconservative market-focused projects. Although this larger argument
   is powerful, there are often 2 peculiar responses to issues of race and
   racism within these analyses. These responses are characterized by what
   I see as an unfortunate backgrounding of these issues in some analyses
   or a conceptually flawed foregrounding in others. These responses
   obscure the evidence that, beyond being aligned with the market-oriented
   goals of these projects, mathematics education has also been aligned
   with their prevailing racial agendas.},

Abstract = {Although students of all levels of education face serious difficulties
   with proof, there is limited research knowledge about how instruction
   can help students overcome these difficulties. In this article, we
   discuss the theoretical foundation and implementation of an
   instructional sequence that aimed to help students begin to realize the
   limitations of empirical arguments as methods for validating
   mathematical generalizations and see an intellectual need to learn about
   secure methods for validation (i.e., proofs). The development of the
   instructional sequence was part of a 4-year design experiment that we
   conducted in an undergraduate mathematics course, prerequisite for
   admission to an elementary (Grades K-6) teaching certification program.
   We focus on the implementation of the instructional sequence in the last
   of 5 research cycles of our design experiment to exemplify our
   theoretical framework (in which cognitive conflict played a major role)
   and to discuss the promise of the sequence to support the intended
   learning goals.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a taxonomy of strategies for single-digit
   multiplication, then uses it to elucidate the nature of the learning
   tasks involved in multiplication. In preceding work, it has generally
   been assumed that much of children's strategy development is driven by
   changes in their general conceptual capabilities relating to number. In
   contrast, we argue that, during the period in which single-digit
   multiplication is the focus of explicit classroom attention, changes in
   strategy use are primarily driven by the learning of number-specific
   computational resources. For this reason, we categorize multiplication
   strategies based upon the number-specific resources that are employed in
   their execution. To support our conclusions, we draw from a corpus of
   interviews with third-grade students that were conducted before, during,
   and after instruction in multiplication.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study, reported in this article was to explore the
   mathematical discourse in which four dyads engaged while sharing the
   storybook One Snowy Night (Butterworth, 1989) while at home or in other
   locations (e.g., day care centers). Each dyad consisted of a mother and
   her four-year-old child. Various discourse patterns were evident, and
   while there were commonalities across dyads, each pair shared the book
   in unique ways. In two of the dyads, the mother initiated the
   mathematical discourse; in the other two, the child did. Size,
   subitizing, and counting were the most common mathematical concepts that
   emerged. One dyad attended to a single concept of size, and,the other
   dyads attended to more than one mathematical idea. Some parents
   scaffolded particular problem-solving strategies; others provided more
   generic support. Based on our findings, we discuss insights and issues
   and make suggestions for further research.},

Abstract = {A modeling approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics shifts
   the focus of the learning activity from finding a solution to a
   particular problem to creating a system of relationships that is
   generalizable and reusable. In this article, we discuss the nature of a
   sequence of tasks that can be used to elicit the development of such
   systems by middle school students. We report the results of our research
   with these tasks at two levels. First, we present a detailed analysis of
   the mathematical reasoning development of one small group of students
   across the sequence of tasks. Second, we provide a macrolevel analysis
   of the diversity of thinking patterns identified on two of the problem
   tasks where we incorporate data from multiple groups of students.
   Student reasoning about the relationships between and among quantities
   and their application in related situations is discussed. The results
   suggest that students were able to create generalizable and reusable
   systems or models for selecting, ranking, and weighting data.
   Furthermore, the extent of variations in the approaches that students
   took suggests that there are multiple paths for the development of ideas
   about ranking data for decision making.},

Abstract = {This article reports on a 2-year study about teaching and learning
   mathematics for social justice in an urban, Latino classroom and about
   the role of an NCTM Standards-based curriculum. I was the teacher in the
   study and moved with the class from seventh to eighth grade. Using
   qualitative, practitioner-research methodology, I learned that students
   began to read the world (understand complex issues involving justice and
   equity) using mathematics, to develop mathematical power, and to change
   their orientation toward mathematics. A series of real-world projects
   was fundamental to this change, but the Standards-based curriculum was
   also important; such curricula can theoretically promote equity, but
   certain conditions may need to exist. Social justice pedagogy broadens
   the concept of equity work in mathematics classrooms and may help
   promote a more just society.},

Abstract = {We examined computational estimation skill of 77 college students who
   estimated answers to problems presented in brief intervals. We
   categorized 23 ``think-aloud{''} estimation strategies used by 45
   participants in individual follow-up sessions. Some categories were
   based on strategies found in previous studies others were based on
   responses in this study. Although students correctly estimated answers
   to most problems on addition and subtraction of whole numbers, they
   performed poorly on multiplication and division of decimals and
   subtraction of fractions. Students were more successful in solving
   computational problems than in estimating answers. Scores on the
   estimation tests showed substantial correlation with SAT Mathematics
   scores and with a direct measure of computational skill, but they did
   not significantly correlate with SAT Verbal scores.},

Abstract = {The topic of multiple representations of functions is important in
   secondary school mathematics curricula, yet many students leave high
   school lacking an understanding of the connections among these
   representations. Research results are presented from a study in which
   students' understandings of the connections between algebraic and
   graphical representations of functions were examined. Responses from 178
   students, enrolled in 1st-year algebra through calculus, revealed an
   overwhelming reliance on algebraic representations, even on tasks for
   which a graphical representation seemed more appropriate. The findings
   indicate that for familiar routine problems many students have mastered
   the connections between the algebraic and graphical representations;
   however, such mastery appeared to be superficial at best.},

Abstract = {We define spatial structuring as the mental operation of constructing an
   organization or form for an object or set of objects. It is an essential
   mental process underlying students' quantitative dealings with spatial
   situations. In this article, we examine in detail students' structuring
   and enumeration of 2-dimensional (2D) rectangular arrays of squares. Our
   research indicates that many students do not ``see{''} the row-by-column
   structure we assume in such arrays. We describe the various levels of
   sophistication in students' structuring of these arrays and elaborate
   the nature of the mental process of structuring.},

Abstract = {We analyzed use of the commutative property for solving multiplication
   problems by children who learn about multiplication in schools and by
   street vendors who solve multiplication problems through repeated
   addition. Subjects were Brazilian street vendors with irregular school
   attendance, who had received no, or very little, school instruction on
   multiplication, and 1st- to 3rd-grade Brazilian school children. Results
   from 2 studies show that use of commutativity to solve multiplication
   problems is closely related to use of multiplication. Street sellers who
   rely exclusively on repeated addition to solve such problems may,
   however, use multiplicative commutativity if it represents a clear
   reduction in the number of computational steps needed to reach a
   solution. But their justifications for its use are often based on
   knowledge about multiplication.},

Abstract = {In the work described here we report on our collaborative efforts to
   produce a multicultural mathematics curriculum for Grades K-6 that was
   socially transformative. We drew insights and direction from the
   following discourses: multicultural education, socially proactive
   mathematics, and preservice and in-service teacher deliberations.
   Through group deliberations, the analysis of existing mathematics and
   multicultural curricula, and the sharing of personal histories, we
   planned our teacher-research activities. Our goal was to define
   mathematics as a tool for social analysis. In this article we describe
   the perplexity of issues related to the definition of multicultural
   curricula and mathematics curricula for social transformation, the
   complexities of the group deliberative process, and the demands involved
   in the teacher-research process.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to a growing body of research on teachers'
   content knowledge in mathematics. The domain under investigation was
   elementary number theory. Our main focus concerned the concept of
   divisibility and its relation to division, multiplication, prime and
   composite numbers, factorization, divisibility rules, and prime
   decomposition. We used a constructivist-oriented theoretical framework
   for analyzing and interpreting data acquired in clinical interviews with
   preservice teachers. Participants' responses to questions and tasks
   indicated pervasive dispositions toward procedural attachments, even
   when some degree of conceptual understanding was evident. The results of
   this study provide a preliminary overview of cognitive structures in
   elementary number theory.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine how students' strategies
   for solving percent problems change over grades 5, 7, 9, and 11. The
   questions addressed included the following: What intuitive knowledge do
   students bring to the study of percent? Do students use this intuitive
   knowledge in solving percent problems? What processes do students use to
   solve percent problems? Does choice of solution method differ after
   formal instruction on percent? The researcher employed a cross-sectional
   research design whereby 31 students representing two ability levels
   (middle and high) from grades 5, 7, 9, and 11 were interviewed. The
   responses were compared and contrasted by ability and grade level. The
   5th and 7th graders, who had little or no formal instruction on percent,
   used a variety of strategies including benchmark, ratios, and fractions,
   to solve percent problems. The 9th graders made extensive use of the
   school-taught equation strategy. The 11 th graders, who had been away
   from formal instruction on percent for at least a year, also used the
   equation strategy extensively, but also employed a variety of other
   strategies and were more reflective in their choice of strategy.},

Abstract = {We present findings from a study about obstacles that Black students who
   succeeded in developmental mathematics in community college reported
   having endured in those mathematics classrooms. To understand the types
   of obstacles that can arise for students in these classrooms, we analyze
   data using two frameworks: mathematics identity and dimensions of
   mathematics classrooms. Study participants faced obstacles in three
   categories: (a) impressions of faculty's instructional practices for
   problem solving; (b) negative race-related perceptions they believed
   classmates had about them; and (c) perceptions about instructors'
   expectations. These findings contribute to literature on Black students'
   progress in mathematics by identifying obstacles experienced by students
   who achieve in these courses and can also inform professional
   development learning for mathematics faculty.},

Abstract = {As we all pass through the academy, we enter into mentoring
   relationships with others. Doctoral advisors, in particular, are often
   identified as academic parents. They connect us with academic families
   through which both ideas and ways of working propagate. These
   relationships are often intense and memorable, not always easy but
   always essential to work on, just like the relationships we have with
   our actual families. My academic family lost our patriarch, Jeremy
   Kilpatrick, on September 17, 2022.1 As I write this in October,
   reflecting on his legacy to our field feels timely. After a brief
   biographical sketch, I explore how Jeremy's influence, particularly in
   his role as Editor in Chief of JRME, shaped our field-and my own work as
   editor.},

Abstract = {This study examined the prevalence of teacher tracking in a population
   of 1,822 mathematics teachers in 184 high schools in a single state.
   Results showed that 70\% of teachers were tracked by course level,
   course track, or both. Three fourths of high schools tracked at least
   58\% of their mathematics teachers. We also found significant
   differences in teaching assignments across quintiles of years of
   experience at a teacher's current school. First-quintile teachers were
   the most likely to be assigned low-track or entry-level courses. In
   contrast, fifth-quintile teachers were the most likely to be assigned
   high-track or upper-level courses. These findings indicate that the
   tracking of mathematics teachers is a prevalent and persistent
   inequitable structure in most high schools.},

Abstract = {Caring for student affect when teaching social justice mathematics (SJM)
   is important because discussions of social inequities may elicit
   emotional responses from students. This article extends previous
   conceptualizations of SJM, which typically encompass dual goals of
   teaching dominant and critical mathematics, by theorizing a third set of
   goals-affective pedagogical goals. Dominant, critical, and affective
   pedagogical goals are described within a framework of Three Dimensions
   of SJM. Two illustrative cases, one in a Title I public middle school
   and the other in an elite independent school, are presented to explore
   how affective pedagogical goals may be mediated by context. Affordances
   and tensions of affective pedagogical goals are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article explores secondary teachers' opportunities to learn from an
   innovative real analysis course, as reflected in their actual classroom
   teaching. The course used cases of teaching as a site for applying
   mathematics and developing pedagogical mathematical practices. This
   article explores particular teaching moments in (N = 6) secondary
   teachers' classrooms, and the attributions they gave for why they
   engaged in those teaching practices. Teachers engaged in instructional
   practices that exemplified course objectives, and their attributions for
   their actions contribute a teacher perspective on opportunities to learn
   in teacher education from (advanced) mathematical coursework. Results
   highlight cases of teaching and modeled instruction as catalysts of
   change and as opportunities to develop pedagogy from mathematical
   activity, and vice versa.},

Abstract = {A theoretical model describing young students' (Grades 1-3)
   functional-thinking modes was formulated and validated empirically (n =
   345), hypothesizing that young students' functional-thinking modes
   consist of recursive patterning, covariational thinking,
   correspondence-particular, and correspondence-general factors. Data
   analysis suggested that functional-thinking tasks can be categorized on
   the basis of the proposed model. Analysis traced three categories of
   students that represent different functional-thinking profiles. Category
   1 students exhibited a recursive-thinking profile. Category 2 students
   utilized a combination of recursive and contextual strategies and
   exhibited an emergent covariational and correspondence-particular
   thinking. Category 3 students approached functional-thinking situations
   flexibly, using a combination of covariational and correspondence
   strategies. A structural model showed two parallel paths from recursive
   patterning to correspondence-general through correspondence-particular
   or covariational.},

Abstract = {To design and improve instruction in mathematical proof, mathematics
   educators require an adequate definition of proof that is faithful to
   mathematical practice and relevant to pedagogical situations. In both
   mathematics education and the philosophy of mathematics, mathematical
   proof is typically defined as a type of justification that satisfies a
   collection of necessary and sufficient conditions. We argue that
   defining the proof category in this way renders the definition incapable
   of accurately capturing how category membership is determined. We
   propose an alternative account-proof as a cluster category-and
   demonstrate its potential for addressing many of the intractable
   challenges inherent in previous accounts. We will also show that
   adopting the cluster account has utility for how proof is researched and
   taught.},

Abstract = {This theoretical article describes a framework to conceptualize
   computational thinking (CT) dispositions-tolerance for ambiguity,
   persistence, and collaboration-and facilitate integration of CT in
   mathematics learning. CT offers a powerful epistemic frame that, by
   foregrounding core dispositions and practices useful in computer
   science, helps students understand mathematical concepts as outward
   oriented. The article conceptualizes the characteristics of CT
   dispositions through a review of relevant literature and examples from a
   study that explored secondary mathematics teachers' engagement with CT.
   Discussion of the CT framework highlights the complementary relationship
   between CT and mathematical thinking, the relevance of mathematics to
   21st-century professions, and the merit of CT to support learners in
   experiencing these connections.},

Abstract = {Through their work on the Fractions Project, Steffe and Olive (2010)
   identified a progression of fraction schemes that describes students'
   development toward more and more sophisticated ways of operating with
   fractions. Although several quantitative studies have affirmed this
   progression, the question has remained open as to whether it is specific
   to the U.S. classrooms in which these studies were conducted or whether
   it describes a developmental progression that crosses international
   boundaries. The purpose of our replication study was to address that
   question using data gathered from written assessments of 76 5th- and
   6th-grade students in China. Results indicate a remarkably similar
   progression among students in the United States and students in China.},

Abstract = {Many studies in mathematics education research occur with a
   nonrepresentative sample and are never replicated. To challenge this
   paradigm, I designed a large-scale study evaluating student conceptions
   in group theory that surveyed a national, representative sample of
   students. By replicating questions previously used to build theory
   around student understanding of subgroups, cyclic groups, and
   isomorphism with over 800 students, I establish the utility of
   replication studies to (a) validate previous results, (b) establish the
   prevalence of various student conceptions, and (c) reexamine theoretical
   propositions. Data analyzed include 1 round of open-ended surveys, 2
   rounds of closed-form surveys, and 30 follow-up interviews. I illustrate
   the potential of replication studies to refine theory and theoretical
   propositions in 3 ways: by offering alternate interpretations of student
   responses, by challenging previous pedagogical implications, and by
   reevaluating connections between theories.},

Abstract = {We present the results of 2 studies, a citation-based study and an
   opinion-based study, that ranked the relative quality of 20
   English-language journals that exclusively or extensively publish
   mathematics education research. We further disaggregate the
   opinion-based data to provide insights into variations in judgment of
   journal quality based on geographic location, journal affiliations and
   publishing records, and experience in the field. We also report factors
   that survey respondents indicated were important indicators of journal
   quality. Finally, we compare our results to previous related rankings
   and conclude by discussing how our results might inform authors,
   editors, and evaluators in their efforts to publish and recognize
   quality research in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {We examined geometric calculation with number tasks used within a unit
   of geometry instruction in a Taiwanese classroom, identifying the source
   of each task used in classroom instruction and analyzing the cognitive
   complexity of each task with respect to 2 distinct features: diagram
   complexity and problem-solving complexity. We found that instructional
   tasks were drawn from multiple sources, including textbooks, tests,
   supplemental materials, and the teacher. Our analysis of cognitive
   complexity indicated that the instructional tasks frequently involved
   both diagram complexity and problem-solving complexity. Moreover, the
   geometric calculation with number tasks from nontextbook sources tended
   to be more cognitively demanding than those found in the textbooks.
   Implications of task analysis on geometry domain and textbook analysis
   studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {A growing body of literature has identified quantitative and
   covariational reasoning as critical for secondary and undergraduate
   student learning, particularly for topics that require students to make
   sense of relationships between quantities. The present study extends
   this body of literature by characterizing an undergraduate precalculus
   student's progress during a teaching experiment exploring angle measure
   and trigonometric functions. I illustrate that connecting angle measure
   to measuring arcs and conceiving the radius as a unit of measure can
   engender trigonometric meanings that encompass both unit circle and
   right triangle trigonometry contexts. The student's progress during the
   teaching experiment also indicates that a covariation meaning for the
   sine function supports using the sine function to represent emergent
   relationships between quantities in novel situations.},

Title = {Understanding Prospective Mathematics Teachers' Processes for Making

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},

Abstract = {This study investigated the processes used by prospective mathematics
   teachers as they examined middle-school students' work solving
   statistical problems using a computer software program. Students' work
   on the tasks was captured in a videocase used by prospective teachers
   enrolled in a mathematics education course focused on teaching secondary
   mathematics with technology. The researchers developed a model for
   characterizing prospective teachers' attention to students' work and
   actions and interpretations of students' mathematical thinking. The
   model facilitated the identification of four categories: describing,
   comparing, inferring, and restructuring. Ways in which the model may be
   used by other researchers and implications for the design of pedagogical
   tasks for prospective teachers are discussed.},

Title = {Expanding the notion of impact of K-12 Standards-based mathematics and

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {3-34},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Research on the impact of Standards-based, K-12 mathematics programs
   (i.e., written curricula and associated teaching practices) and of
   reform calculus programs has focused primarily on student achievement
   and secondarily, and rather ineffectively, on student attitudes. This
   research has shown that reform programs have competed well with
   traditional programs in terms of student achievement. Results for
   attitude change have been much less conclusive because of conceptual and
   methodological problems. We critically review this literature to argue
   for broader conceptions of impact that target new dimensions of program
   effect and examine interactions between dimensions. We also briefly
   present the conceptualization, design, and broad results of one study,
   the Mathematical Transitions Project (MTP), which expanded the range of
   impact along those lines. The MTP results reveal substantial diversity
   in students' experience within and between research sites, different
   patterns of experience between high school and university students, and
   surprising relationships between achievement and attitude for some
   students.},

   mathematical definition. Their conceptions of a definition were revealed
   through individual and group activities in which they were asked to
   consider a number of possible definitions of four mathematical concepts:
   two geometric and two analytic. Data consisted of written responses to
   questionnaires and transcriptions of videotaped group discussions. The
   findings point to three types of students' arguments: mathematical,
   communicative, and figurative. In addition, two types of reasoning were
   identified surrounding the contemplation of alternative definitions: for
   the geometric concepts, the dominant type of reasoning was a
   definition-based reasoning; for the analytic concepts, the dominant type
   was an example-based reasoning. Students' conceptions of a definition
   are described in terms of the features and roles they attribute to a
   mathematical definition.},

Abstract = {We report results from a study of instructional practices that relate to
   student achievement in high school classrooms in which a standards-based
   curriculum (Core-Plus) was used. We used regression techniques to
   identify teachers' background characteristics, behaviors, and concerns
   that are associated with growth in student achievement and further
   described these associations via graphical representations and logical
   analysis. The sample consisted of 40 teachers and their 1,466 students
   in 26 schools. Findings support the importance of professional
   development specifically aimed at preparing to teach the curriculum.
   Generally, teaching behaviors that are consistent with the standards'
   recommendations and that reflect high mathematical expectations were
   positively related to growth in student achievement.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses fairness and equity in assessment of mathematics,
   The increased importance of teachers' interpretative judgments of
   students' performance in high-stakes assessments and in the classroom
   has prompted this exploration, Following a substantial theoretical
   overview of the field, the issues are illustrated by two studies that
   took place in the context of a reformed mathematics curriculum in
   England. One study is of teachers' informal classroom assessment
   practices the other is of their interpretation and evaluation of
   students' formal written mathematical texts (i.e., responses to
   mathematics problems). Results from both studies found that broadly
   similar work could be interpreted differently by different teachers. The
   formation of teachers' views of students and evaluation of their
   mathematical attainments appeared to be influenced by surface features
   of students' work and behavior and by individual teachers' prior
   expectations. We discuss and critique some approaches to improving the
   quality and equity of teachers' assessment.},

Abstract = {Graph-related practices are central to scientific endeavors, and
   graphing has long been hailed as one of the core ``general process
   skills{''} that set scientists apart. We use two case studies from a
   large study among scientists to exemplify our findings that graphing is
   not a context-independent skill. Rather, scientists' competencies with
   respect to graph interpretation are highly contextual and are a function
   of their familiarity with the phenomena to which the graph pertains. If
   graphing practices are not general but are tied to embodied
   understandings and familiarity with representation practices, then there
   are implications for teaching graphing in school mathematics and science
   settings.},

Abstract = {The Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitude Scales (MAS) have been used
   extensively in research on gender differences in mathematics learning
   outcomes. The MAS comprise 9 scales measuring attitudes related to
   mathematics learning, including Mathematics as a Male Domain. The
   construct ``mathematics as a male domain{''} remains a critical variable
   in explorations of the continued disadvantage experienced by females in
   the field of mathematics. We present recent research evidence that
   indicates that several items in the Mathematics as a Male Domain scale
   of the MAS may no longer be valid. In light of this evidence, it is
   appropriate to consider revisions to the scale to ensure that it
   continues to measure accurately its originally operationalized
   construct.},

Abstract = {In an attempt to explain subjects' difficulties with particular types of
   compare problems, Lewis and Mayer (1987) have presented a model that
   simulates the comprehension processes when solving these problems. The
   crucial component of their model is the `'consistency hypothesis,''
   according to which students are more likely to experience
   representational difficulties-and consequently to make errors-when the
   presentation of the terms in the relational statement of the compare
   problem is not consistent with their preferred format. To test this
   model, an experiment was carried out in which 40 fifth graders were
   asked to solve and retell a set of one-step compare problems. The
   accuracy data, solution times, and, especially, the retelling data
   yielded strong evidence in favor of the consistency hypothesis.},

Abstract = {Seventy kindergarten children who had spent the year solving a variety
   of basic word problems were individually interviewed as they solved
   addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, multistep, and
   nonroutine word problems. Thirty-two children used a valid strategy for
   all nine problems and 44 correctly answered seven or more problems. Only
   5 children were not able to answer any problems correctly. The results
   suggest that children can solve a wide range of problems, including
   problems involving multiplication and division situations, much earlier
   than generally has been presumed. With only a few exceptions, children's
   strategies could be characterized as representing or modeling the action
   or relationships described in the problems. The conception of problem
   solving as modeling could provide a unifying framework for thinking
   about problem solving in the primary grades. Modeling offers a
   parsimonious and coherent way of thinking about children's mathematical
   problem solving that is relatively straightforward and is accessible to
   teachers and students alike.},

Abstract = {A theory of the cognitive processes involved in doing and learning place
   value arithmetic is proposed.  The theory is embodied in a computer
   model that simulates the learning of multicolumn subtraction under
   one-on-one tutoring.  The model is used to measure the relative
   difficulty of two different methods for subtraction, with either a
   conceptual or a procedural representation. The model predicts that
   regrouping is more difficult to learn than an alternative method,
   particularly in a conceptual representation, a result that contradicts
   current practice in U.S. schools.},

Abstract = {A follow-up of a cluster-randomized trial evaluated the long-term
   impacts of a scale-up model composed of 10 research-based guidelines
   grounded in learning trajectories. Two treatment groups received the
   intervention during the prekindergarten year, and one of these groups
   received follow-through support in kindergarten and first grade.
   Business-as-usual curricula were used in all other cases, including all
   years for the control group. Early effects on mathematics achievement
   decreased through fourth grade but reemerged at fifth grade. These
   results support both a latent trait hypothesis, whereby stable
   characteristics of students explain differences in achievement, and a
   latent foundation hypothesis, whereby early mathematical knowledge and
   skills provide a foun-dation for competence in mathematics in later
   years, especially those that involve challenging mathematics.},

Abstract = {Coaching is a popular, yet costly, professional development structure.
   Therefore, understanding the learning opportunities coaching provides is
   essential. Following a framework by Campbell and Griffin (2017), we
   explore five elementary school teachers' learning opportunities during
   15 meetings and 23 lessons with two instructional coaches in two
   schools. Using Greeno's (2005) situative perspective, we focus on
   coach-teacher dyads, examining the substance and depth (Coburn, 2003) of
   their conversations. Results indicate that most coach-teacher talk
   centered on logistics, whereas mathematics conversations were rare. We
   consider institutional contexts that shaped the dyads' discussions,
   ultimately viewing the coaches and teachers as ``sensible beings{''}
   (Leatham, 2006) with valid reasons for focusing discussions as they did.
   Coaching implications and directions for research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Textbooks are a standard component of undergraduate mathematics courses,
   but research shows that students often do not view textbooks as
   productive resources to support learning. This article seeks to
   understand the factors affecting how individuals engage in reading a
   calculus textbook excerpt and what they learn from reading. To better
   understand the separate roles of background knowledge and other reading
   practices, we compare 2 readers: a 2nd-semester calculus student and a
   norunathe-matics STEM professor. We employ the concepts of sense making
   and the implied reader to analyze each reader's experience and a
   disciplinary literacy perspective to explain the similarities and
   differences we find between the 2 readers. We propose the concept of
   didactical disciplinary literacy-an adaptation of disciplinary literacy
   applied to didactical texts-to describe the ways that the professor drew
   on his identity as a teacher to shape his reading practices.},

Abstract = {Amid debates about the continued salience of gender in mathematics; this
   report summarizes an IES-funded investigation of gender-related patterns
   in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99
   (ECLS-K). Girls' and boys' mathematics achievement, confidence, and
   interest were examined, along with experiences at home and school.
   Mathematics performance gaps favoring boys appeared soon after children
   began kindergarten and then widened during elementary grades. Gender
   differences in mathematical confidence were larger than differences in
   both achievement and interest. Although boys' and girls' parent-reported
   home experiences differed in stereotypical ways, particularly among
   high-SES students, such differences appeared unrelated to gender gaps in
   mathematics outcomes. Teacher-reported instructional practices also shed
   little light on gender gaps in mathematics performance; however,
   teachers' perceptions of girls and boys could play a role.},

Abstract = {This article presents a comparison of the proof validation behavior of
   beginning undergraduate students and research-active mathematicians.
   Participants' eye movements were recorded as they validated purported
   proofs. The main findings are that (a) contrary to previous suggestions,
   mathematicians sometimes appear to disagree about the validity of even
   short purported proofs; (b) compared with mathematicians, undergraduate
   students spend proportionately more time focusing on ``surface
   features{''} of arguments, suggesting that they attend less to logical
   structure; and (c) compared with undergraduates, mathematicians are more
   inclined to shift their attention back and forth between consecutive
   lines of purported proofs, suggesting that they devote more effort to
   inferring implicit warrants. Pedagogical implications of these results
   are discussed, taking into account students' apparent difficulties with
   proof validation and the importance of this activity in both school-and
   university-level mathematics education.},

Abstract = {This article offers a particular analytic method from systemic
   functional linguistics, thematic analysis, which reveals the
   mathematical meaning potentials construed in discourse. Addressing
   concerns that discourse analysis is too often content-free, thematic
   analysis provides a way to represent semantic structures of mathematical
   content, allows for content comparisons to be drawn between classroom
   episodes, and identifies points of possible student misinterpretation.
   Analyses of 2 middle school classroom excerpts focusing on area 1 that
   derives triangle area formulas from the rectangle area formula and
   another that connects parallelogram and rectangular area are used to
   delineate the method. Descriptions of similarities and differences in
   the classroom discourse highlight how, in each classroom, mathematical
   terms such as base and height were used in semantically related but
   distinct ways. These findings raise the question of whether students
   were aware of and able to navigate such semantic shifts.},

Abstract = {There has been increased engagement in studying discourse in the field
   of mathematics education. But what exactly is a discourse, and how do
   researchers go about analyzing discourses? This study examines 108
   articles from 6 international journals in mathematics education by
   asking questions such as these: In which traditions and in relation to
   which kinds of epistemological assumptions are the articles situated?
   How is the concept of discourse used and defined? How are mathematical
   aspects of the discourse accentuated? The results of this study show
   that a variety of conceptualizations are used for analyzing discourses
   but also that many articles would benefit from strengthening those
   conceptualizations by explicitly defining the concept of discourse,
   situating the article in relation to epistemological assumptions, and
   relating the work to other discourse studies in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {A content analysis of over 28,000 pages from 141 elementary school
   mathematics textbooks published between 1900 and 2000 shows that widely
   used mathematics textbooks have changed substantially. Textbooks from
   the early part of the century were typically narrow in content but
   presented substantial amounts of advanced arithmetic and also asked
   students simultaneously to engage with material in effortful and
   conceptual ways. A period of change marked the middle of the century,
   when less advanced topics were presented and problem-solving tasks were
   simplified. From the mid-1960s onward, however, the trend reversed, and
   3 major changes occurred in primary school mathematics curricula over
   the next 4 decades: (a) expansion of topics and the number of pages
   devoted to each topic; (b) a shift of traditionally more advanced topics
   from higher to lower grades; and, (c) within arithmetic, an increase in
   the number, abstraction, and cognitive demand of problem-solving
   strategies. Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the
   historical study of mathematics and curriculum in U.S. schools.},

Abstract = {Using curriculum-specific tools for measuring fidelity of implementation
   is an essential yet often overlooked aspect of examining relationships
   among textbooks, teaching, and student learning. This ``Brief Report{''}
   describes the variety of ways that curriculum implementation is measured
   and argues that there is an urgent need to develop curriculum-sensitive
   tools for analyzing classroom practice. The report outlines the use of
   the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) theory to develop analytical
   tools for measuring implementation of two middle-grades reform
   mathematics curricula: Connected Mathematics and MathThematics. The
   report also presents next steps in this program of research.},

Abstract = {This article describes one student teacher's interactions with
   mathematics curriculum materials during her internship in a kindergarten
   classroom. Anne used curriculum materials from two distinct programs and
   taught lessons multiple times to different groups of children. Although
   she used each curriculum in distinct ways, her curriculum use was
   adaptive in both cases. Anne's specific ways of reading, evaluating, and
   adapting the curriculum materials contrast with previous results about
   beginning teachers' curriculum use. Several key factors appeared to
   contribute to Anne's particular ways of using the curriculum materials:
   features of her student-teaching placement, her personal resources and
   background, and characteristics of the materials. Directions for future
   research about student teachers' and other teachers' curriculum use are
   suggested in accord with these factors.},

Abstract = {A yearlong experimental study showed positive effects of a professional
   development project that involved 19 urban elementary schools, 180
   teachers, and 3735 students from one of the lowest performing school
   districts in California. Algebraic reasoning as generalized arithmetic
   and the study of relations was used as the centerpiece for work with
   teachers in Grades 1-5. Participating teachers generated a wider variety
   of student strategies, including more strategies that reflected the use
   of relational thinking, than did nonparticipating teachers. Students in
   participating classes showed significantly better understanding of the
   equal sign and used significantly more strategies reflecting relational
   thinking during interviews than did students in classes of
   nonparticipating teachers.},

Abstract = {This article describes an investigation into mathematics for teaching in
   current teacher education practice in South Africa. The study focuses on
   formal evaluative events across mathematics teacher education courses in
   a range of institutions. Its theoretical orientation is informed by
   Bernstein's educational code theory and the analytic frame builds on
   Ball and Bass' notion of ``unpacking{''} in the mathematical work of
   teaching. The analysis of formal evaluative events reveals that across
   the range of courses, and particularly mathematics courses designed
   specifically for teachers, compression or abbreviation (in contrast to
   unpacking) of mathematical ideas is dominant. The article offers
   theoretical and practical explanations for why this might be so, as well
   as avenues for further research.},

Abstract = {This article considers the question of what specific actions a teacher
   might take to create a culture of inquiry in a secondary school
   mathematics classroom. Sociocultural theories of learning provide the
   framework for examining teaching and learning practices in a single
   classroom over a two-year period. The notion of the zone of proximal
   development (ZPD) is invoked as a fundamental framework for explaining
   learning as increasing participation in a community of practice
   characterized by mathematical inquiry. The analysis draws on classroom
   observation and interviews with students and the teacher to show how the
   teacher established norms and practices that emphasized mathematical
   sense-making and justification of ideas and arguments and to illustrate
   the learning practices that students developed in response to these
   expectations.},

Abstract = {This article presents a case study in which two eighth-grade students
   developed knowledge for modeling a physical device called a winch. In
   particular, the students learned (a) to distinguish equations that are
   true for any value of the independent variable from equations that
   constrain the independent variable to a unique value and (b) to solve
   the latter type of equation to determine when specific physical events
   occur. The analysis of how these understandings emerged led to two
   results. First, the analysis demonstrated that students have and can use
   criteria for evaluating algebraic representations. Second, the analysis
   led to a theoretical frame that explains how students can develop
   modeling knowledge by coordinating such criteria with knowledge for
   generating and using algebraic representations. The frame extends
   research on students' algebraic modeling, cognitive processes and
   structures for using mathematical representations, and the development
   of mathematical knowledge.},

Abstract = {The article develops the notion of covariational reasoning and proposes
   a framework for describing the mental actions involved in applying
   covariational reasoning when interpreting and representing dynamic
   function events. It also reports on an investigation of high-performing
   2nd-semester calculus students' ability to reason about covarying
   quantities in dynamic situations. The study revealed that these students
   were able to construct images of a function's dependent variable
   changing in tandem with the imagined change of the independent variable,
   and in some situations, were able to construct images of rate of change
   for contiguous intervals of a function's domain. However, students
   appeared to have difficulty forming images of continuously changing rate
   and could not accurately represent or interpret inflection points or
   increasing and decreasing rate for dynamic function situations. These
   findings suggest that curriculum and instruction should place increased
   emphasis on moving students from a coordinated image of two variables
   changing in tandem to a coordinated image of the instantaneous rate of
   change with continuous changes in the independent variable for dynamic
   function situations.},

Abstract = {This article describes a novel assessment method used to examine
   Japanese and American teachers' ideas about what constitutes effective
   mathematics pedagogy. Forty American and 40 Japanese teachers
   independently evaluated either an American or Japanese mathematics
   lesson captured on videotape. Their comments were classified into over
   1600 idea units, which were then sorted into a hierarchy of categories
   derived from the data. Next, the authors hypothesized underlying ideal
   instructional scripts that could explain the patterns of responses.
   Whereas the U.S. teachers were supportive of both traditional and
   nontraditional elementary school mathematics instruction and had
   different scripts for the two lessons, the Japanese teachers had only
   one ideal lesson script that was closely tied to typical Japanese
   mathematics instruction. The findings suggest that U.S. teachers may
   have more culturally sanctioned options for teaching mathematics;
   however, Japanese teachers may have a more detailed and widely shared
   theory about how to teach effectively.},

Abstract = {This study contrasted the achievement of students using either
   commercial curricula (CC) for initial fraction learning with the
   achievement of students using the Rational Number Project (RNP) fraction
   curriculum. The RNP curriculum placed particular emphasis on the use of
   multiple physical models and translations within and between modes of
   representation-pictorial, manipulative, verbal, real-world, and
   symbolic. The instructional program lasted 28-30 days and involved over
   1600 fourth and fifth graders in 66 classrooms that were randomly
   assigned to treatment groups. Students using RNP project materials had
   statistically higher mean scores on the posttest and retention test and
   on four (of six) subscales: concepts, order, transfer, and estimation.
   Interview data showed differences in the quality of students' thinking
   as they solved order and estimation tasks involving fractions. RNP
   students approached such tasks conceptually by building on their
   constructed mental images of fractions, whereas CC students relied more
   often on standard, often rote, procedures when solving identical
   fraction tasks. These results are consistent with earlier RNP work with
   smaller numbers of students in several teaching experiment settings.},

Abstract = {Six fifth-grade students came to instruction with informal knowledge
   related to partitioning. This knowledge initially focused on
   partitioning ``units of measure one{''} into a specific number of parts.
   Students were able to build on their informal knowledge to
   reconceptualize and partition units to solve problems involving
   multiplication of fractions in ways that were meaningful to them.
   Students built their knowledge by developing mental processes related to
   focusing on fractional amounts and to partitioning units in different
   ways, Students also frequently returned to their initial focus on the
   number of parts and to ideas embedded in equal-sharing situations.},

Abstract = {As a researcher-teacher, I examined 7th-graders' experiences with a
   problem-centered curriculum and pedagogy, focusing on SES differences in
   students' reactions to learning mathematics through problem solving.
   Although higher SES students tended to display confidence and solve
   problems with an eye toward the intended mathematical ideas, the lower
   SES students preferred more external direction and sometimes approached
   problems in a way that caused them to miss their intended mathematical
   points. An examination of sociological literature revealed ways in which
   these patterns in the data could be related to more than individual
   differences in temperament or achievement among the children. I suggest
   that class cultural differences could relate to students' approaches to
   learning mathematics through solving open, contextualized problems.},

Abstract = {This article examines the mathematical sense-making of children as they
   use physical devices to learn about linear functions. The study
   consisted of videotaped problem-solving sessions in which pairs of 8th
   graders worked on linear function tasks using a winch apparatus, a
   device with springs, and a computerized input-output machine. The
   following questions are addressed: How do children make sense of
   physical devices designed by experts to foster mathematical learning?
   How does the use of such devices enable learners to access selected
   aspects of a mathematical domain? The concept of transparency is
   suggested as an index of access to knowledge and activities rather than
   as an inherent feature of objects. The analysis shows that transparency
   is a process mediated by unfolding activities and users' participation
   in ongoing sociocultural practices.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of the
   intuitive activity that precedes the construction of quantity, in
   particular, to make inferences concerning developmental trends and needs
   in children's unitizing processes. Using a cross-sectional design, the
   study analyzed the partitioning strategies of 346 children from grades
   four through eight in terms of a framework that translated economy in
   the number or size of pieces and the use of perceptual cues into
   sophistication in unitizing. At each grade level, a greater percentage
   of students used economical partitioning strategies than used less
   economical cut-and-distribute strategies. As grade level increased, the
   percentage of students using economical strategies increased, indicating
   a shift away from the distribution of singleton units toward the use of
   more composite units. Strategies were heavily influenced by social
   practice related to the commodity being shared and, to a lesser degree,
   by the numerical portion of the given extensive quantities.},

Abstract = {We report on an innovative design of algorithmic analysis that supports
   automatic online assessment of students' exploration of geometry
   propositions in a dynamic geometry environment. We hypothesized that
   difficulties with and misuse of terms or logic in conjectures are rooted
   in the early exploration stages of inquiry. We developed a generic
   activity format for if-then propositions and implemented the activity on
   a platform that collects and analyzes students' work. Finally, we
   searched for ways to use variation theory to analyze ninth-grade
   students' recorded work. We scored and classified data and found
   correlation between patterns in exploration stages and the conjectures
   students generated. We demonstrate how automatic identification of
   mistakes in the early stages is later reflected in the quality of
   conjectures.},

Abstract = {The practice of futurity within Indigenous communities has existed since
   time immemorial, with past, present, and future intertwined and with a
   focus on (re)membering and healing. As futurity becomes more popular in
   mainstream venues, it raises questions about how it will affect
   mathematics education (research). This Commentary makes an argument for
   desire-based research frameworks and Indigenous futurity praxis as key
   components of a spiritual turn, somewhat distinct from the
   sociopolitical turn our field took about a decade ago. I analyze some of
   the equity issues that arose in the March 2022 issue ofJRME, raise three
   important questions to consider in our research, and offer suggestions
   so that we may embrace a spiritual turn.},

Abstract = {Using data from a large urban district, this study investigated whether
   racial inequality in access to eighth-grade algebra is a reproduction of
   differences in prior opportunities to learn (as evidenced by grades,
   test scores, and level of prior mathematics course) or whether patterns
   reflect an increase in inequality such that racial differences in access
   remain when controlling for academic background. We considered how this
   varies by the racial composition of the school; further, we examined
   differences in access between both Black and Hispanic students and their
   White peers as well as differences between Black and Hispanic students.
   The results point to patterns of reproduction of inequality in racially
   integrated schools, with some evidence of increasing inequality in
   predominantly Hispanic schools.},

Abstract = {Mathematics educators have been publishing their work in international
   research journals for nearly 5 decades. How has the field developed over
   this period? We analyzed the full text of all articles published in
   Educational Studies in Mathematics and the Journal for Research in
   Mathematics Education since their foundation. Using Lakatos's (1978)
   notion of a research programme, we focus on the field's changing
   theoretical orientations and pay particular attention to the relative
   prominence of the experimental psychology, constructivist, and
   sociocultural programmes. We quantitatively assess the extent of the
   ``social turn,{''} observe that the field is currently experiencing a
   period of theoretical diversity, and identify and discuss the
   ``experimental cliff,{''} a period during which experimental
   investigations migrated away from mathematics education journals.},

Abstract = {In our response to Clements and Sarama (2017), we address the 5 issues
   that they identify as criticisms of our Research Commentary (Kitchen \&
   Berk, 2016). As in our original commentary, we highlight concerns we
   have regarding the delivery of CAI programs and potential misuses of
   CAI, particularly at Title I schools that largely serve historically
   marginalized student groups. Specifically, we concentrate on how CAI may
   contribute to underserved students generally experiencing mathematics in
   impoverished ways that do not align with reforms being advocated by the
   mathematics education community. We also argue that Clements and Sarama
   appear to dismiss or ignore our central argument that some CAI programs
   are not designed or are not being used to support the development of
   students' mathematical reasoning and fluency.},

Abstract = {This article provides an example of, and lessons from, teaching and
   learning critical mathematics in a Chicago public neighborhood-high
   school with a social justice focus. It is based on a qualitative study
   of my untracked, 12th-grade mathematics class, a full-year enactment of
   mathematics for social and racial justice. Students were Black and
   Latin@ from a low-income, working-class community with a tradition of
   resistance. Any neighborhood student could enroll without selection
   criteria. The class goal was for students to cocreate a classroom in
   which they would learn and use college preparatory, conceptually based
   mathematics to study and understand social reality to prepare themselves
   to change it. Through analyzing my practice, I address possibilities and
   challenges of curriculum development and teaching, examine student
   learning, and pose questions and directions for further research and
   practice.},

Abstract = {When it comes to improving student achievement in mathematics, a core
   belief is that curriculum materials are of the utmost importance.
   However, the link between a curriculum program and student learning is
   affected by the ways in which teachers use resources to design learning
   experiences. In the first half of this commentary, I raise questions
   about the emphasis in research on finding the most effective curriculum
   programs or the most effective teaching practices as separate from one
   another, and I claim that research should prioritize understanding the
   most effective ways in which a teacher can use available materials,
   including expanding the definition of ``effective.{''} In the second
   half of this commentary, I suggest how researchers can build on existing
   work to define, describe, and support teachers in learning more
   effective practices for using curriculum in ways that bring together
   research on curriculum effectiveness and teaching effectiveness.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the development of 4th-grade students' understanding of the
   transition from experimental relative frequencies of outcomes to
   theoretical probabilities with a focus on the foundational statistical
   concepts of variation and expectation. We report students' initial and
   changing expectations of the outcomes of tossing one and two coins, how
   they related the relative frequency from their physical and
   computer-simulated trials to the theoretical probability, and how they
   created and interpreted theoretical probability models. Findings include
   students' progression from an initial apparent equiprobability bias in
   predicting outcomes of tossing two coins through to representing the
   outcomes of increasing the number of trials. After observing the
   decreasing variation from the theoretical probability as the sample size
   increased, students developed a deeper understanding of the relationship
   between relative frequency of outcomes and theoretical probability as
   well as their respective associations with variation and expectation.
   Students' final models indicated increasing levels of probabilistic
   understanding.},

Abstract = {In this study, I examined the relationship between teachers'
   mathematical knowledge and instruction. Twenty-one K-8 teachers who were
   enrolled in a master's program were followed for 3 years to study how
   their mathematical knowledge and teaching changed over time. The results
   of multilevel growth models indicated that gains in teachers'
   mathematical knowledge predicted changes in the quality of their lesson
   design, their mathematical agenda, and the classroom climate. Analyses
   of interviews and classroom observation data conducted with a subgroup
   of teachers revealed that in addition to the gains teachers made in
   their mathematical knowledge, their exit level of knowledge played a
   significant role in the quality of the changes in their practices.},

Abstract = {This study sought to understand how aspects of middle school mathematics
   teachers' knowledge and conceptions are related to their enactment of
   cognitively demanding tasks. I defined the enactment of cognitively
   demanding tasks to involve task selection and maintenance of the
   cognitive demand of high-level tasks and examined those two dimensions
   of enactment separately. I used multilevel logistic regression models to
   investigate how mathematical knowledge for teaching and conceptions of
   teaching and learning mathematics for 213 middle school mathematics
   teachers were related to their enactment of cognitively demanding tasks.
   I found that teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching and
   conceptions of teaching and learning mathematics were contingent on one
   another and significantly related to teachers' enactment of cognitively
   demanding tasks.},

Abstract = {This article presents results of a research study with a pretest,
   instruction, and posttest design that aimed to identify students' mental
   models of integers and investigate how these models change based on
   instruction on the unary and/or binary meanings of the minus sign.
   Sixty-one first graders' responses to interview questions about negative
   integer values and order and directed magnitudes were examined to
   characterize the students' mental models. The models reveal that
   initially, students over-relied on various combinations of whole number
   principles as they tried to understand negative integers. However, a
   significant number of students developed formal mental models based on
   their instruction.},

Abstract = {Although preservice elementary school teachers (PSTs) lack the
   understanding of multidigit whole numbers necessary to teach in ways
   that empower students mathematically, little is known about their
   conceptions of multidigit whole numbers. The extensive research on
   children's understanding of multidigit whole numbers is used to
   explicate PSTs' conceptions of these numbers. A grounded theoretical
   approach leads to the development of a framework for PSTs' conceptions
   of multidigit whole numbers, and that framework facilitates description
   of their conceptions and their difficulties in the context of the
   standard algorithms. The framework also enables discussion of the PSTs'
   performance in other contexts.},

Abstract = {Approximately 1400 middle-grades students who had used either the
   Connected Mathematics Project (CMP) or the MATHThematics (STEM or MT)
   program for at least 3 years were assessed on two widely used tests, the
   Stanford Achievement Test, Ninth Edition (Stanford 9) and the New
   Standards Reference Exam in Mathematics (NSRE). Hierarchical Linear
   Modeling (HLM) was used to analyze subtest results following methods
   described by Raudenbush and Bryk (2002). When Standards-based students'
   achievement patterns are analyzed, traditional topics were learned.
   Students' achievement levels on the Open Ended and Problem Solving
   subtests were greater than those on the Procedures subtest. This finding
   is consistent with results documented in many of the studies reported in
   Senk and Thompson (2003), and other sources.},

Abstract = {This article examines a calculus graphing schema and the triad stages of
   schema development from Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory.
   Previously, the authors studied the underlying structures necessary for
   students to process concepts and enrich their knowledge, thus
   demonstrating various levels of understanding via the calculus graphing
   schema. This investigation built on this previous work by focusing on
   the thematization of the schema with the intent to expose those possible
   structures acquired at the most sophisticated stages of schema
   development. Results of the analyses showed that these successful
   calculus students, who appeared to be operating at varying stages of
   development of their calculus graphing schemata, illustrated the
   complexity involved in achieving thematization of the schema, thus
   demonstrating that thematization was possible.},

Abstract = {The NCTM's Research Committee has prepared this article as a means to
   raise the awareness about equity and issues surrounding equity from a
   research perspective as well as to support the NCTM's commitment to the
   Equity Principle. The committee discusses the concept of equity from
   three perspectives: as a subject of research, as a ``critical lens{''}
   with which to examine research, and as a cross-disciplinary theme.
   Equity issues offer a unique opportunity to unite research and practice
   within mathematics education and across other disciplines.},

Abstract = {This study compared the mathematics achievement of eighth graders in the
   first three school districts in Missouri to adopt NSF-funded
   Standards-based middle grades mathematics curriculum materials (MATH
   Thematics or Connected Mathematics Project) with students who had
   similar prior mathematics achievement and family income levels from
   other districts. Achievement was measured using the mathematics portion
   of the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) administered to all 8th graders
   in the state annually beginning in the spring of 1997. Significant
   differences in achievement were identified between students using
   Standards-based curriculum materials for at least 2 years and students
   from comparison districts using other curriculum materials. All of the
   significant differences reflected higher achievement of students using
   Standards-based materials. Students in each of the three districts using
   Standards-based materials scored higher in two content areas (data
   analysis and algebra), and these differences were significant.},

Abstract = {Building on an ethnographic study of nurses' working practices on the
   ward (Hoyles, Noss, \& Pozzi, 2001), we elaborate the notion of situated
   abstraction as an analytical tool for understanding nurses' conceptions
   of the intensive quantity of drug concentration. Data were gathered
   through interviews based on simulations of tasks observed to be
   problematic in the earlier study. The methodology was designed to
   explore nurses' conceptions in a more detailed way than is possible
   during in situ observations and to undertake a pointed examination of
   the degree of situatedness of nurses' knowledge and reasoning. Analysis
   of the data demonstrated that nurses' conceptions were abstracted within
   their practice when they were able to coordinate their mathematical
   knowledge with their professional expertise, yet their conceptions were
   situated, as evidenced by their difficulties in realizing this
   coordination in tasks too distant from their practice.},

Abstract = {We examine the performance of 8 pairs of 2nd-year algebra classes that
   had been matched on pretest scores. One class in each pair used the
   UCSMP Advanced Algebra curriculum, and the other used the
   2nd-year-algebra text in place at the school. Achievement was measured
   by a multiple-choice posttest and a free-response posttest.
   Opportunity-to-learn (OTL) measures were used to ensure that items were
   fair to both groups of students. UCSMP students generally outperformed
   comparison students on multistep problems and problems involving
   applications or graphical representations. Both groups performed
   comparably on items testing algebraic skills, Hence, concerns that
   students studying from a Standards-oriented curriculum will achieve less
   than students studying from a traditional curriculum are not
   substantiated in this instance.},

Abstract = {In this article we report on 3 studies in which we investigated the
   effects of teaching mathematics in a mixed-ability setting on students'
   achievements and teachers' attitudes. The findings of the first 2
   studies indicate that the achievements of students need not be
   compromised in a heterogeneous setting; on the contrary, the
   achievements of our average and less able students proved to be
   significantly higher when compared to their peers in the same-ability

Abstract = {This study explores preservice teachers' understanding of the operator
   construct of rational number. Three related problems, given in 1-on-1
   clinical interviews, consisted of finding 3/4 of a pile of 8 bundles of
   4 counting sticks. Problem conditions were suggestive of showing 3/4 of
   the number of bundles (duplicator/partition-reducer {[}DPR]
   subconstruct) and 3/4 of the size of each bundle (stretcher/shrinker
   {[}SS] subconstruct). This study provides confirming instances that
   students use these 2 rational number operator subconstructs. The SS
   strategies are identified when the rational number, as an operator, is
   distributed over a uniting operation. With these SS strategies, rational
   number is conceptualized as a rate. However, the SS strategies were used
   less often than the DPR strategies. Detailed cognitive models of these
   strategies in terms of the underlying conceptual units, their
   structures, and their modifications, were produced, and a `'mathematics
   of quantity'' notational system was used as an analytical tool to
   describe and model the embedded abstractions.},

Abstract = {We investigated the development of linear measure concepts within an
   instructional unit on paths and lengths of paths, part of a large-scale
   curriculum development project funded by the National Science Foundation
   (NSF). We also studied the role of noncomputer and computer interactions
   in that development. Data from paper and-pencil assessments, interviews,
   and case studies were collected within the context of a pilot test of
   this unit with 4 third graders and field tests with 2 third-grade
   classrooms. Three levels of strategies for solving length problems were
   observed: (a) apply general strategies such as visual guessing of
   measures and naive guessing of numbers or arithmetic operations; (b)
   draw hatch marks, dots, or line segments to partition lengths to serve
   as perceptible units to quantify the length; (c) no physical
   partitioning-use an abstract unit of length, a `'conceptual ruler,'' to
   project onto unsegmented objects. Those students who had connected
   numeric and spatial representations evinced different and more powerful
   problem-solving strategies in geometric situations than those who had
   forged fewer such connections.},

Title = {Inhibiting factors in generating examples by mathematics teachers and

Journal = {JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {The main objectives of this study were to identify difficulties
   encountered by mathematics teachers and student teachers associated with
   the concept of binary operation regarding the associative and
   commutative properties and to reveal possible sources for them.
   Thirty-six in-service mathematics teachers and 67 preservice mathematics
   teachers participated in the study. All participants were presented with
   a task calling for the generation of a counterexample, namely, a binary
   operation that is commutative but nor associative. Responses to the task
   were analyzed according to four categories: correctness, productiveness,
   mathematical content, and underlying difficulties. The findings point to
   similarities and differences between the two groups. Both groups
   exhibited a weak concept by failing to produce a correct example and by
   using a limited content search-space. These findings suggest two main
   inhibiting factors: one related to the overgeneralization of the
   properties of basic binary operations and the other related to
   pseudo-similarities attributed to these properties, which seem to be
   created by the recurring theme of order. Teachers were superior to
   student teachers on the categories of correctness and productiveness.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to ``amine the benefits to teachers who
   used impromptu writing prompts in first- and second-year algebra
   classes. The study attempted to answer two questions: (a) What can
   teachers learn about their students' understanding of school mathematics
   from reading their responses to in-class, impromptu writing prompts;
   and, (b) Are instructional practices influenced as a result of reading
   students' responses to in-class, impromptu writing prompts? An
   interpretive research methodology was used to collect and analyze data.
   The researchers concluded that the teachers' assessment of students'
   understanding of school mathematics was enhanced by reading their
   students' responses to impromptu writing prompts, and that the teachers
   in the study perceived that their instructional practices were
   influenced as a result of reading their students' responses to impromptu
   writing prompts.},
