Abstract = {The mathematical situations of play and exploration introduced here have
   been developed as an empirical research instrument for the longitudinal
   study ``erStMaL{''} (early Steps in Mathematics Learning). They are
   designed as situations that allow children and a guiding adult to
   construct situation-related knowledge in common dialogue processes and
   in mutual conditions. In addition, the situations focus on the activity
   of the persons involved, as well as the meaning of artefacts as objects
   of different cultural worlds. Besides relevant theoretical aspects for
   the development of the mathematical situations of play and exploration,
   exemplary analyses are introduced to clarify the conceptual aims.},

Abstract = {This article reports on young children's self-efficacy beliefs and their
   corresponding performance of mathematical and nonmathematical tasks
   typically encountered in kindergarten. Participants included 132
   kindergarten children aged 5-6 years old. Among the participants, 69
   children were identified by the social welfare department as being
   abused and/or neglected. Individual interviews were conducted where
   children were asked to assess their self-efficacy regarding sorting
   tasks, mathematics tasks, and reciting the alphabet. Children were then
   requested to perform each of the tasks. Results revealed that no
   significant differences were found between the abused and neglected
   children and their peers regarding their self-efficacy beliefs and
   performances for any of the tasks. For some of the tasks, children were
   able to correctly assess their performance, while for other tasks,
   children overestimated their performance. Possible reasons for these
   outcomes are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this article, we explore the responses of a group of undergraduate
   mathematics students to tasks that deal with areas, perimeters, volumes,
   and derivatives. The tasks challenge the conventional representations of
   formulas that students are used to from their schooling. Our analysis
   attends to the specific mathematical ideas and ways of reasoning raised
   by students, which supported or hindered their appreciation of an
   unconventional representation. We identify themes that emerged in these
   responses and analyze those via different theoretical lenses-the lens of
   transfer and the lens of aesthetics. We conclude with pedagogical
   recommendations to help learners appreciate the structure of mathematics
   and challenge the resilience of certain conventions.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes that the theoretical concept of cultural models can
   offer useful insights into parental involvement in their child's
   mathematical achievement and the resources they use to go about gaining
   information in culturally diverse learning settings. This examination
   takes place within a cultural-developmental framework and draws on the
   notion of cultural models to explicate parental understandings of their
   child's mathematics achievement and what resources are used to make
   sense of this. Three parental resources are scrutinized: (a) the
   teacher, (b) examination test results, and (c) constructions of child
   development. The interviews with 22 parents revealed some ambiguity
   around the interpretation of these resources by the parent, which was
   often the result of incongruent cultural models held between the home
   and the school. The resources mentioned are often perceived as being
   unambiguous but show themselves instead to be highly interpretive
   because of the diversity of cultural models in existence in culturally
   diverse settings. Parents who are in minority or marginalized positions
   tend to have difficulties in interpreting cultural models held by
   school, thereby disempowering them to be parentally involved in the way
   the school would like.},

Abstract = {In this article, we describe how using prediction during instruction can
   create learning opportunities to enhance the understanding and doing of
   mathematics. In doing so, we characterize the nature of the predictions
   students made and the levels of sophistication in students' reasoning
   within a middle school algebra context. In this study, when linear and
   exponential functions were taught, prediction questions were posed at
   the launch of the lessons to reflect the mathematical ideas of each
   lesson. Students responded in writing along with supportive reasoning
   individually and then discussed their predictions and rationale. A total
   of 395 prediction responses were coded using a dual system:
   sophistication of reasoning, and the mechanism students appeared to
   utilize to formulate their prediction response. The results indicate
   that using prediction provoked students to connect among mathematical
   ideas that they learned. It was apparent that students also visualized
   mathematical ideas in the problem or the possible results of the
   problem. These results suggest that using prediction in fact provides
   learning opportunities for students to engage in mathematical sense
   making and reasoning, which promotes students' understanding of the
   mathematics that they learn.},

Abstract = {This article reports an analysis of 44 prospective middle school
   mathematics teachers' pre-existing knowledge of rigid geometric
   transformations, specifically the geometric translations. The main data
   source for this study was the participants' responses to the tasks that
   were presented during semi-structured clinical interviews. The findings
   of the study revealed that prospective teachers had difficulties
   recognizing, describing, executing, and representing geometric
   translations. The results indicated that teacher candidates held various
   views about the geometric translations: (1) translation as rotational
   motion, (2) translation as translational motion, and (3) translation as
   mapping. The results further revealed various interpretations of the
   vector that defines translations: (1) vector as a force, (2) vector as a
   line of symmetry, (3) vector as a direction indicator, and (4) vector as
   a displacement. Although many of the teacher candidates interviewed knew
   that a vector has a magnitude and a direction, this knowledge did not
   generally lead them to conclude that vectors define translations.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report a study in which nine research mathematicians
   were interviewed with regard to the goals guiding their reading of
   published proofs and the type of reasoning they use to reach these
   goals. Using the data from this study as well as data from a separate
   study (Weber, Journal for Research in Mathematics Education 39: 431-459,
   2008) and the philosophical literature on mathematical proof, we
   identify three general strategies that mathematicians employ when
   reading proofs: appealing to the authority of other mathematicians who
   read the proof, line-by-line reading, and modular reading. We argue that
   non-deductive reasoning plays an important role in each of these three
   strategies.},

Abstract = {This article examines the extent to which Wittgenstein's analytical
   framework may be relevant to philosophical reflection on
   ethnomathematics. The discussion develops Bill Barton's suggestion that
   a philosophical basis for the ethnomathematical program should include
   and explain culturally different mathematics systems, and the
   coexistence of different conceptions of mathematics and rationality.
   Wittgenstein's concept of mathematics as normative statements rather
   than descriptions is introduced to dialogue with ethnomathematics
   research and its anthropological descriptions of how mathematics is used
   and propagated in specific practices. It is argued that although the
   formulations in Wittgenstein's analytical framework alone are
   insufficient to account for the political character of ethnomathematics,
   they do provide a starting point for ethnomathematics as a
   non-metaphysical version of mathematics.},

Abstract = {The relation between types of tasks and the mathematical reasoning used
   by students trying to solve tasks in a national test situation is
   analyzed. The results show that when confronted with test tasks that
   share important properties with tasks in the textbook the students
   solved them by trying to recall facts or algorithms. Such test tasks did
   not require conceptual understanding. In contrast, test tasks that do
   not share important properties with the textbook mostly elicited
   creative mathematically founded reasoning. In addition, most successful
   solutions to such tasks were based on this type of reasoning.},

Abstract = {This paper (1) presents a conceptual framework for analyzing the
   mathematics addressed in probability lessons and (2) uses the framework
   to compare the mathematics that two teachers with contrasting teaching
   approaches addressed in class when teaching the topic of probability.
   One teaching approach aimed to develop understanding; the other
   emphasized mechanistic answer finding. Class work on 193 problems was
   analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, showing some similarities and
   some differences in the mathematics that the two teachers offered to
   students. The differences found seemed to be linked to the teachers'
   teaching approaches. The findings suggest that teachers who adopt
   different teaching approaches, to some extent, make available to learn
   different mathematics even when they use the same textbooks.},

Abstract = {This study investigated how children tackled a task on division by
   fractions, and how they formulated numerical algorithms from their
   strategies. The task assigned to the students was to find the length of
   a rectangle given its area and width. The investigation was carried out
   as follows: First, the strategies invented by eight 10- or 11-year-old
   students, all identified as capable and having positive attitudes
   towards mathematics, were categorised. Second, the formulation of
   numerical algorithms from the strategies constructed by nine students
   with similar abilities and attitudes towards mathematics was
   investigated. The participants developed three types of strategies
   (making the width equal to 1, making the area equal to 1, and changing
   both area and width to natural numbers) and showed the possibility of
   formulating numerical algorithms for division by fractions referring to
   their strategies.},

Title = {Developing a `leading identity': the relationship between students'
   mathematical identities and their career and higher education
   aspirations},

Abstract = {The construct of identity has been used widely in mathematics education
   in order to understand how students (and teachers) relate to and engage
   with the subject (Kaasila, 2007; Sfard \& Prusak, 2005; Boaler, 2002).
   Drawing on cultural historical activity theory (CHAT), this paper adopts
   Leont'ev's notion of leading activity in order to explore the key
   `significant' activities that are implicated in the development of
   students' reflexive understanding of self and how this may offer
   differing relations with mathematics. According to Leont'ev (1981),
   leading activities are those which are significant to the development of
   the individual's psyche through the emergence of new motives for
   engagement. We suggest that alongside new motives for engagement comes a
   new understanding of self-a leading identity-which reflects a hierarchy
   of our motives. Narrative analysis of interviews with two students (aged
   16-17 years old) in post-compulsory education, Mary and Lee, are
   presented. Mary holds a stable `vocational' leading identity throughout
   her narrative and, thus, her motive for studying mathematics is defined
   by its `use value' in terms of pursuing this vocation. In contrast, Lee
   develops a leading identity which is focused on the activity of studying
   and becoming a university student. As such, his motive for study is
   framed in terms of the exchange value of the qualifications he hopes to
   obtain. We argue that this empirical grounding of leading activity and
   leading identity offers new insights into students' identity
   development.},

   development of mathematical claims},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 20},
Abstract = {This study introduces a framework for analyzing opportunities for
   mathematical reasoning (MR) in school mathematics, using MR-relevant
   claims and their derivation as the unit of analysis. We contend that
   this approach can effectively capture a broad range of opportunities for
   MR across various teaching situations. The framework, rooted in
   commognition, entails identifying necessary object-level narratives
   (NOLs) and the processes involved in their construction and
   substantiation. After theoretical development, the framework was refined
   through analyses of mathematics lessons in Norwegian primary school
   classrooms. Examples from the data illustrate how to utilize the
   framework in analysis and what such analyses can reveal in four typical
   teaching situations: the introduction of new mathematical objects, the
   introduction of procedures, work on exercise tasks, and work on
   problem-solving tasks. Drawing from the analysis of these examples, we
   discuss the value of the framework for analyzing MR in school
   mathematics and how such analysis can benefit teachers and researchers.},

Abstract = {Facilitators, i.e., individuals who lead professional development (PD)
   programs, play a crucial role in providing high-quality PD to teachers,
   which is particularly relevant in the context of teaching mathematics
   with technology given the ubiquitous calls to exploit the potential of
   digital mathematical tools (DMT). However, quantitative research
   investigating facilitators' beliefs and practices remains scarce,
   particularly research comparing countries. In this cross-national study
   conducted in China and Germany, we developed an online questionnaire and
   surveyed n = 340 facilitators to provide a comprehensive quantitative
   picture of facilitators' beliefs and practices concerning PD for
   teaching mathematics with DMT. The results highlight various
   commonalities and differences between facilitators in China and Germany.
   We reveal significant differences concerning cooperation among
   facilitators, adaptation of PD materials, how facilitators
   professionalise themselves, and beliefs about when and how to use DMT.
   Furthermore, Chinese facilitators emphasise technical competence more
   strongly, while German facilitators focus more on developing teachers'
   pedagogical content knowledge. A critical commonality was that
   facilitators' self-efficacy concerning teaching with DMT and their
   self-efficacy for conducting PD for teaching mathematics with DMT was
   low. We discuss how the results can be linked to differences in the
   educational and cultural context and outline possible complements and
   enrichments for both countries' educational systems.},

Title = {Understanding the cognitive processes of mathematical problem posing:
   evidence from eye movements},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 23},
Abstract = {This study concerns the cognitive process of mathematical problem
   posing, conceptualized in three stages: understanding the task,
   constructing the problem, and expressing the problem. We used the eye
   tracker and think-aloud methods to deeply explore students' behavior in
   these three stages of problem posing, especially focusing on
   investigating the influence of task situation format and mathematical
   maturity on students' thinking. The study was conducted using a 2 x 2
   mixed design: task situation format (with or without specific numerical
   information) x subject category (master's students or sixth graders).
   Regarding the task situation format, students' performance on tasks with
   numbers was found to be significantly better than that on tasks without
   numbers, which was reflected in the metrics of how well they understood
   the task and the complexity and clarity of the posed problems. In
   particular, students spent more fixation duration on understanding and
   processing the information in tasks without numbers; they had a longer
   fixation duration on parts involving presenting uncertain numerical
   information; in addition, the task situation format with or without
   numbers had an effect on students' selection and processing of
   information related to the numbers, elements, and relationships rather
   than information regarding the context presented in the task. Regarding
   the subject category, we found that mathematical maturity did not
   predict the quantity of problems posed on either type of task. There was
   no significant main group difference found in the eye-movement metrics.},

Abstract = {Good stories, literary or mathematical, have the ability to keep the
   reader engaged and wanting for more. However, poorly designed stories
   may also elicit a negative aesthetic reaction and thereby reduce
   engagement. By drawing on literary theory and Dietiker's (For the
   Learning of Mathematics 33(3):14-19, 2013; Educational Studies in
   Mathematics 90(3):285-302, 2015) theoretical framework of mathematical
   stories, this essay conceptualises two aspects of mathematical stories
   that are likely to be perceived by the readers as aesthetic
   deficiencies: mathematical cheap plot tricks and mathematical plot
   holes. Additionally, examples of them are proposed from various areas of
   mathematics curriculum and some ideas of how they can be avoided, so as
   not to hinder engagement, are offered.},

Abstract = {Professors in proof-based mathematics courses often intend that the
   feedback they provide on students' flawed proofs will promote proof
   comprehension. In this theoretical article, we investigate how such
   feedback can be formulated. Drawing on Lakatos's process of proof and
   refutation, we propose the notion of heuristic refutation feedback for
   feedback on a flawed proof that contains a mathematical argument,
   possibly incomplete, that logically implies that the student's proof is
   invalid. Such feedback is heuristic in the sense that interpreting and
   utilizing it invites mathematical reasoning that can contribute to
   development of proof comprehension. We build on Toulmin's model of
   argumentation to analyze possible variations in the formulation of
   feedback. Based on data from a Real-Analysis course, we highlight two
   key decisions entailed in formulating refutation feedback: deciding what
   flawed (possibly implicit) claim in the student's proof to refute, and
   deciding how explicitly to present the various elements of the
   refutation argument. We exemplify these decisions in two particular
   types of refutation feedback that we have identified: refutation by
   counter-example and refutation by false implication. We show how
   different formulations of refutation feedback may afford different
   opportunities for student-engagement with particular facets of proof
   comprehension. Our findings suggest how professors can purposefully
   tailor feedback in order to achieve particular didactic goals.},

Abstract = {Felix Klein's notion of ``double discontinuity{''} between university
   mathematics and secondary school mathematics has persisted in
   mathematics teacher education. Situating this study in Hong Kong, we
   investigated three prospective secondary teachers' experiences in higher
   education and secondary mathematics classrooms, including their figured
   worlds, identities, and mathematical knowledge constructed through those
   experiences. Our analysis revealed their contrasting experiences in
   these two contexts, adding to our understanding of the phenomenon of
   ``double discontinuity{''} in terms of not only how it is relevant to
   Hong Kong but also how it may manifest in the specific cultural context.
   Moreover, we found coherency and continuity during the prospective
   teachers' secondary-tertiary transition; their learning experiences in
   both environments served as critical resources upon which they reflected
   to envision their future mathematics teaching. We conclude with
   implications and suggestions for mathematics teacher education to
   support prospective teachers' (and their future students') transitions
   between high school and university mathematics.},

Abstract = {Visuospatial representations of numbers and their relationships are
   widely used in mathematics education. These include drawn images, models
   constructed with concrete manipulatives, enactive/embodied forms,
   computer graphics, and more. This paper addresses the analytical
   limitations and ethical implications of methodologies that use broad
   categorizations of representations and argues the benefits of dynamic
   qualitative analysis of arithmetical-representational strategy across
   multiple semi-independent aspects of display, calculation, and
   interaction. It proposes an alternative methodological approach
   combining the structured organization of classification with the
   detailed nuance of description and describes a systematic but flexible
   framework for analysing nonstandard visuospatial representations of
   early arithmetic. This approach is intended for use by researchers or
   practitioners, for interpretation of multimodal and nonstandard
   visuospatial representations, and for identification of small
   differences in learners' developing arithmetical-representational
   strategies, including changes over time. Application is illustrated
   using selected data from a microanalytic study of struggling students'
   multiplication and division in scenario tasks.},

Abstract = {Concerns about health and disease have long pervaded mathematics
   education research, yet their implications have been underappreciated.
   This article focuses on three contemporary relationships amplified by
   the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) school mathematics and national health, (2)
   mathematics educators' roles in distinguishing the health needs of
   students, and (3) mathematics instruction as either enhancing or
   threatening students' mental health and social adjustment. We argue that
   these concerns are foundational preoccupations of mathematics education
   research that have persistently shaped debates over who should learn
   mathematics, how, and to what ends. Our study examines histories of
   school mathematics and health discourses to explore how particular
   notions of health entered US mathematics education during the 19th and
   early twentieth centuries in ways that resonate with recent research
   trends and responses to COVID-19. We especially attend to how
   health/pathology distinctions reconfigured hierarchies of nationality,
   sex, race, and dis/ability within exclusionary, segregated, colonial,
   and tracked mathematics instruction. By mapping some of the shifting
   contours of health and pathology over time, we emphasize the potential
   dangers of the pandemic reanimating long-circulating dividing practices,
   such as in emerging trends comparing national metrics of well-being,
   responding to perceived trauma with differentiated instruction, and
   seeking to calibrate healthy mathematics identities in marginalized
   groups.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we network five frameworks (cognitive demand, lesson
   cohesion, cognitive engagement, collective argumentation, and student
   contribution) for an analytic approach that allows us to present a more
   holistic picture of classrooms which engage students in justifying. We
   network these frameworks around the edges of the instructional triangle
   as a means to coordinate them to illustrate the observable relationships
   among teacher, students(s), and content. We illustrate the potential of
   integrating these frameworks via analysis of two lessons that, while
   sharing surface level similarities, are profoundly different when
   considering the complexities of a classroom focused on justifying. We
   found that this integrated comparison across all dimensions (rather than
   focusing on just one or two) was a useful way to compare lessons with
   respect to a classroom culture that is characterized by students
   engaging in justifying.},

Title = {Rhythmic movement as a tacit enactment goal mobilizes the emergence of
   mathematical structures},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {99},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-309},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article concerns the purpose, function, and mechanisms of students'
   rhythmic behaviors as they solve embodied-interaction problems,
   specifically problems that require assimilating quantitative information
   structures embedded into the environment. Analyzing multimodal data of
   one student tackling a bimanual interaction design for proportion, we
   observed the (1) evolution of coordinated movements with stable
   temporal-spatial qualities; (2) breakdown of this proto-rhythmic form
   when it failed to generalize across the problem space; (3) utilization
   of available resources to obtain greater specificity by way of measuring
   spatial spans of movements; (4) determination of an arithmetic pattern
   governing the sequence of spatial spans; and (5) creation of a
   meta-rhythmic form that reconciles continuous movement with the
   arithmetic pattern. The latter reconciliation selectively retired,
   modified, and recombined features of her previous form. Rhythmic
   enactment, even where it is not functionally imperative, appears to
   constitute a tacit adaptation goal. Its breakdown reveals latent
   phenomenal properties of the environment, creating opportunities for
   quantitative reasoning, ultimately supporting the learning of curricular
   content.},

Abstract = {In this article, I consider the question: why did numeracy become a
   relevant and sensible thing to consider in mathematics education? I
   historicize the numeracy discourse by writing a genealogy of how the
   concept of numeracy emerged in scholarship, with a focus on the USA. I
   argue that numeracy descends from three mathematics education reform
   narratives and emerged, in part, as a compromise among these narratives.
   The numeracy discourse unites reform narratives about technological
   change, equity and justice, and social stability. I find these
   narratives in the numeracy discourse and describe them as promises-or
   assurances about the present and future-central in the numeracy
   discourse: (1) numeracy promises to reflect modern reality, (2) numeracy
   promises to empower, and (3) innumeracy promises to have social costs.
   These three promises seem to each emerge from different
   conceptualizations of the importance of numeracy and the purposes of
   reform in its name. Finally, I consider the purposes of genealogy by
   discussing my current thinking about numeracy.},

Abstract = {Research focusing on algebra from primary to early secondary school
   level has made several major advances over the past decades. Students'
   difficulties have been identified and supportive teaching and learning
   environments have been set up (Cai \& Knuth, 2011; Kieran, 2007;
   Radford, 2008, Mathematics Education Research Journal, 26, 257-277,
   2014). The effectiveness of these environments relies on the teachers'
   ability to pay careful attention to students' thinking, which then
   guides their instructional decisions. This inevitably raises the crucial
   question of the teachers' knowledge for managing these types of
   situations in the classroom. In this context, this paper focuses on the
   mathematical knowledge for teaching figural pattern activities of 100
   teachers at the primary and early secondary school levels. The results
   show that many primary teachers lack the essential knowledge for
   teaching these types of activities: they do not have a clear idea of
   their goal, they do not consider non-standard algebraic generalisations
   to be correct and they generally seem unable to help students to improve
   their arithmetical generalisation. Secondary school teachers also seem
   unable to give adequate feedback to improve students' arithmetical
   generalisation. Although they seem to recognise that these activities
   are intended to improve algebraic thinking, they do not have a clear
   perception of the role that primary school learning can play in the
   development of this algebraic thinking.},

Abstract = {This study examines the consequences of whole-body, multi-party activity
   for mathematics learning, both in and out of the classroom. We develop a
   theoretical framework that brings together contemporary theories related
   to social space, embodied cognition, and mathematical activity. Then,
   drawing on micro-ethnographic and case-comparative techniques, we
   examine and juxtapose two cases of implementing whole-body,
   collaborative movement to engage learners in the mathematics of number
   sense and ratio and proportion. Analytically foregrounding the
   interdependence among setting, embodied activity, and mathematical tools
   and practices, we illustrate how whole-body collaboration can transform
   how learners experience learning environments and make sense of
   important mathematical ideas. The analysis enriches our understanding of
   the changing spatial landscapes for learning and doing mathematics as
   well as how re-instating bodies in mathematics education can open up new
   forms of collective mathematical sense-making and activity.},

Abstract = {We examine the case of a lesson planning session within the context of
   professional development for dialogic instruction, and the lesson
   enacted following this session, which was intended to provide
   opportunities to 11th and 12th grade algebra students to explore
   polynomial functions in terms of their roots and linear factors. Our
   goal was, through the close analysis of the planning and enactment of
   the lesson, to gain deeper understanding of how the two participants
   were framing mathematical learning and how such different frames may
   explain the disparity between the planned lesson and its outcome. The
   analysis and discussion point to the complexities of supporting teachers
   in transitioning from a ``doing{''} frame to an ``exploring{''} frame.},

Abstract = {Existing studies have quantitatively evidenced the relatedness between
   problem posing and problem solving, as well as the magnitude of this
   relationship. However, the nature and features of this relationship need
   further qualitative exploration. This paper focuses on exploring the
   interactions, i.e., mutual effects and supports, between problem posing
   and problem solving. More specifically, this paper analyzes the forms of
   interactions that happened between these two activities, the ways that
   those interactions supported prospective primary teachers' conceptual
   understanding, and the difficulties that prospective teachers
   encountered while engaged in alternating problem-posing and
   problem-solving activities. The results indicate that problem posing
   contributes to problem-solving effectiveness while problem solving
   supports participants in posing more reasonable problems. Finally,
   multiple difficulties that demonstrate prospective primary teachers'
   misunderstanding with fractions and their operations provide insight for
   teacher educators to design problem-posing tasks involving fractions.},

Abstract = {Preparing students for their lives beyond schooling appears to be a
   universal goal of formal education. Much has been done to make
   mathematics education more ``realistic,{''} but such activities
   nevertheless generally remain within the institutional norms of
   education. In this article, we assume that pedagogic relations are also
   an integral part of working life and draw on Bernstein's work to address
   their significant features in this context. However, unlike
   participation in formal mathematics education, where the discipline is
   central, workers are likely to be confronted by, and need to reconcile,
   a range of other valued workplace discourses, both epistemic and
   social/cultural in nature. How might mathematics education work towards
   overcoming the hiatus between these two very different institutional
   settings? This article will argue that the skills of
   recontextualisation, central to teachers' work, should be integral to
   the mathematics education of all future workers. It will consider
   theoretical perspectives on pedagogic discourse and the consequences of
   diverse knowledge structures at work, with implications for general and
   vocational mathematics education.},

Abstract = {In many mathematics curricula, the notion of limit is introduced three
   times: the limit of a sequence, the limit of a function at a point and
   the limit of a function at infinity. Despite the use of very similar
   symbols, few connections between these notions are made explicitly and
   few papers in the large literature on student understanding of limit
   connect them. This paper examines the nature of connections made by
   students exposed to this fragmented curriculum. The study adopted a
   phenomenographic approach and used card sorting and comparison tasks to
   expose students to symbols representing these different types of limit.
   The findings suggest that, while some students treat limit cases as
   separate, some can draw connections, but often do so in ways which are
   at odds with the formal mathematics. In particular, while there are
   occasional, implicit uses of neighbourhood notions, no student in the
   study appeared to possess a unifying organisational framework for all
   three basic uses of limit.},

Title = {Students' distributive reasoning with fractions and unknowns},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To understand relationships between students' quantitative reasoning
   with fractions and their algebraic reasoning, a clinical interview study
   was conducted with 18 middle and high school students. The study
   included six students with each of three different multiplicative
   concepts, which are based on how students create and coordinate
   composite units (units of units). Students participated in two 45-min
   semi-structured interviews and completed a written fraction assessment.
   This paper reports on how 12 students operating with the second and
   third multiplicative concepts demonstrated distributive reasoning in
   equal sharing problems and in taking fractions of unknowns. Students
   operating with the second multiplicative concept who demonstrated
   distributive reasoning appeared to lack awareness of the results of
   their reasoning, while students operating with the third multiplicative
   concept demonstrated this awareness and the construction of more
   advanced distributive reasoning when they worked with unknowns.
   Implications for relationships between students' fractional knowledge
   and algebraic reasoning are explored.},

Abstract = {Proving an existence theorem is less intuitive than proving other
   theorems. This article presents a semiotic analysis of significant
   fragments of classroom meaning-making which took place during the
   class-session in which the existence of the midpoint of a line-segment
   was proven. The purpose of the analysis is twofold. First follow the
   evolution of students' conceptualization when constructing a geometric
   object that has to satisfy two conditions to guarantee its existence
   within the Euclidean geometric system. An object must be created
   satisfying one condition that should lead to the fulfillment of the
   other. Since the construction is not intuitive it generates a dilemma as
   to which condition can be validly assigned initially. Usually, the
   students' spontaneous procedure is to force the conditions on a randomly
   chosen object. Thus, the second goal is to highlight the need for the
   teacher's mediation so the students understand the strategy to prove
   existence theorems. In the analysis, we use a model of conceptualization
   and interpretation based on the Peircean triadic SIGN.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this longitudinal study is to investigate whether an
   early childhood intervention using an explicit and transparent number
   naming system will have a lasting benefit to English and Spanish
   speaking children in their mathematics achievement related to number
   sense by accelerating their acquisition of concepts of numeracy and
   place value recognition. Statistical analysis of the results of the
   Stanford Achievement Test administered to school children in grades 1
   through 5 at a school in Texas (USA) over a 6-year period of time showed
   consistent differences between those children who had participated in
   the intervention program by learning to count using explicit numbers
   names in Pre-Kindergarten and those who had not participated in the
   program. The advantages of this study were most apparent in children in
   the fourth grade, 6 years after their Pre-Kindergarten experience with
   explicit number names, particularly with those who had 2 years of
   experience with explicit number names.},

Abstract = {The initial assumption of this article is that there is an overemphasis
   on abstraction-from-actions theoretical approaches in research on
   knowing and learning mathematics. This article uses a critical
   reflection on research on students' ways of constructing mathematical
   concepts to distinguish between abstraction-from-actions theoretical
   approaches and abstraction-from-objects theoretical approaches.
   Acknowledging and building on research on knowing and learning processes
   in mathematics, this article presents a theoretical framework that
   provides a new perspective on the underlying abstraction processes and a
   new approach for interpreting individuals' ways of constructing concepts
   on the background of their strategies to make sense of a mathematical
   concept. The view taken here is that the abstraction-from-actions and
   abstraction-from-objects approaches (although different) are
   complementary (rather than opposing) frameworks. The article is
   concerned with the theoretical description of the framework rather than
   with its use in empirical investigations. This article addresses the
   need for more advanced theoretical work in research on mathematical
   learning and knowledge construction.},

Abstract = {Researchers have increasingly focused on how gestures in mathematics aid
   in thinking and communication. This paper builds on Arzarello's (2006)
   idea of a semiotic bundle and several frameworks for describing
   individual gestures and applies these ideas to a case study of an
   instructor's gestures in an undergraduate abstract algebra class. We
   describe the role that the semiotic bundle plays in shaping the
   potential meanings of gestures; the ways gestural sets create complex
   relationships between gestures; and the role played by polysemy and
   abstraction. These results highlight the complex ways in which
   mathematical meanings-both specific and general-are expressed in
   gesture, and to highlight the integrated nature of elements of the
   semiotic bundle.},

Title = {Effects of using history as a tool to teach mathematics on students'
   attitudes, anxiety, motivation and achievement in grade 11 classrooms},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {For decades, educators have advocated using history of mathematics in
   mathematics classrooms. Empirical research on the efficacy of this
   practice, however, is scarce. A quasi-experiment was used to investigate
   the effects of using history as a tool to teach mathematics on grade 11
   students' mathematics achievement. Effects in three affective domains
   (attitudes, anxiety, and motivation) were also measured. Four classes
   from a school in Singapore participated in this quasi-experiment. The
   experimental group (n = 51) and control group (n = 52) were each made up
   of two classes. Results indicated that using history as a tool to teach
   mathematics had a significant positive effect on students' mathematics
   achievement, in an initial posttest and in two retention tests taken 4
   months and 1 year, respectively, after the last intervention session.
   Significant positive effects were also found on two subscales within the
   affective domain variables (perceived value of mathematics and
   introjection, a type of extrinsic motivation), but only at a posttest
   administered midway through the study. These results suggest that using
   history in mathematics classrooms have both immediate short- and
   long-term effects on students' achievement, but only short-term positive
   effects in the affective domains. These results were discussed using
   qualitative feedback obtained from the participants of this study.},

Abstract = {Developing abilities to create, inquire into, qualify, and choose among
   mathematical problems is an important educational goal. In this paper,
   we elucidate how mathematicians work with mathematical problems in order
   to understand this mathematical process. More specifically, we
   investigate how mathematicians select and pose problems and discuss to
   what extent our results can be used to inform, criticize, and develop
   educational practice at various levels. Selecting and posing problems is
   far from simple. In fact, it is considered hard, complex, and of crucial
   importance. A number of criteria concerning personal interest,
   continuity with previous work, the danger of getting stuck, and how
   fellow mathematicians will respond to the findings are considered when
   mathematicians think about whether to approach a specific problem. These
   results add to previous investigations of mathematicians' practice and
   suggest that mathematics education research could further investigate
   how students select and develop problems, work with multiple problems
   over a longer period of time, and use the solutions to problems to
   support the development of new problems. Furthermore, the negative
   emotional aspects of being stuck in problem solving and students'
   conceptions of solvability and relevance of or interest in a
   mathematical problem are areas of research suggested by our study.},

Abstract = {There is an ongoing discussion within the research field of mathematics
   education regarding the utilization of the history of mathematics within
   mathematics education. In this paper we consider problems that may
   emerge when the historical epistemology of mathematics is paralleled to
   students' conceptual developments in mathematics. We problematize this
   attempt to link the two fields on the basis of Grattan-Guinness'
   distinction between ``history{''} and ``heritage{''}. We argue that when
   parallelism claims are made, history and heritage are often mixed up,
   which is problematic since historical mathematical definitions must be
   interpreted in its proper historical context and conceptual framework.
   Furthermore, we argue that cultural and local ideas vary at different
   time periods, influencing conceptual developments in different
   directions regardless of whether historical or individual developments
   are considered, and thus it may be problematic to uncritically assume a
   platonic perspective. Also, we have to take into consideration that an
   average student of today and great mathematicians of the past are at
   different cognitive levels.},

Abstract = {This research investigates what students' use of statistical language
   can tell us about their conceptions of distribution and sampling in
   relation to informal inference. Prior research documents students'
   challenges in understanding ideas of distribution and sampling as tools
   for making informal statistical inferences. We know that these ideas are
   complex and difficult for students, but little is known about the ways
   in which students' language mediates their statistical problem-solving
   activities within the realm of distribution, sampling, and informal
   inference. This study uses examples from semi-structured interviews with
   eleven undergraduate students from two universities. Interview tasks
   focused on (1) distinctions between distributions of populations,
   samples, and sample statistics; (2) properties of sampling
   distributions; and (3) how to use sampling distributions to make
   informal inferences. Analysis focused on students' use of metonymy
   (i.e., the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that
   of the thing or idea meant). We observed two particular metonymies. The
   first was a paradigmatic metonymy in which students applied the
   properties of the normal distribution to all distributions. Second, we
   observed a proper metonymy in which students talked about sampling
   distributions as compilations of many samples. The potential impact of
   these metonymies on students' ability to solve problems and the
   implications for teaching are discussed.},

Title = {Revisiting the place value concept in the workplace context: the issue

Abstract = {In this paper, we studied the transferring process of five apprentice
   engineering students concerning the place value concept in a
   telecommunication workplace setting. In this setting, a physical
   material, a telecommunication closet (TC), appearing as a concrete
   representation of the ten-numeration system, supported the process of
   generating composite units in a sequential way. The data were generated
   by conducting an interview with each student based on two tasks. In the
   first task, students were asked to locate the place of a particular wire
   pair on the telecommunication closet representation (TC representation).
   In the second task, students were asked to determine the range of values
   that generate this composite unit. Our theoretical and analytical
   framework is guided by the three levels of students' generalization
   activity by Radford (2003) and the work on developmental transfer by
   Engestrom (2001). By identifying shifts in the students' activity (from
   factual to contextual and from contextual to symbolic), we recognized
   three transferring cases: the immediate transfer case, the developmental
   transfer case, and the nondevelopmental transfer case. By comparing and
   contrasting the different cases, we identified four factors that seem to
   facilitate or constrain the transfer development. These are the use of
   metaphors, the development of problem solving strategies, the context
   dependency, and the students' motivation. In conclusion, we discuss the
   educational implications of our findings.},

Abstract = {Based on insights into the nature of vocational mathematical knowledge,
   we designed a computer tool with which students in laboratory schools at
   senior secondary vocational school level could develop a better
   proficiency in the proportional reasoning involved in dilution. We did
   so because we had identified computations of concentrations of chemical
   substances after dilution as a problematic area in the vocational
   education of laboratory technicians. Pre- and post-test results indeed
   show that 47 students aged 16-23 significantly improved their
   proportional reasoning in this domain with brief instruction time (50-90
   min). Effect sizes were mostly large. The approach of using a visual
   tool that foregrounds mathematical aspects of laboratory work thus
   illustrates how vocational mathematical knowledge can be developed
   effectively and efficiently.},

Abstract = {The problem-posing process represents one of the forms of authentic
   mathematical inquiry which, if suitably implemented in classroom
   activities, could move well beyond the limitations of word problems, at
   least as they are typically utilized. The two exploratory studies
   presented sought to investigate the impact of problem-posing activities
   when they are implemented in meaningful situations involving the use of
   cultural artifacts, with its associated mathematics, and particular
   teaching methods. These situations fall under those defined by Stoyanova
   and Ellerton (1996) as semi-structured situations. Furthermore, these
   studies investigated the potential that problem-posing activities have
   for identifying and stimulating critical and creative thinking in
   mathematics.},

Abstract = {The links between the mathematical and cognitive models that interact
   during problem solving are explored with the purpose of developing a
   reference framework for designing problem-posing tasks. When the process
   of solving is a successful one, a solver successively changes his/her
   cognitive stances related to the problem via transformations that allow
   different levels of description of the initial wording. Within these
   transformations, the passage between successive phases of the
   problem-solving process determines four operational categories: decoding
   (transposing the text into more explicit relations among the data and
   the operating schemes, induced by the constraints of the problem),
   representing (transposing the problem via a generated mental model),
   processing (identifying an associated mathematical model based on the
   mental configurations suggested by the problem and own mathematical
   competence), and implementing (applying identified mathematical
   techniques to the particular situation of the problem, with the purpose
   of drafting a conventional solution). The study of this framework in
   action offers insights for more effective teaching and can be used in
   problem posing and problem analysis in order to devise questions more
   relevant for deep learning.},

Abstract = {The importance of students' problem-posing abilities in mathematics has
   been emphasized in the K-12 curricula in the USA and China. There are
   claims that problem-posing activities are helpful in developing creative
   approaches to mathematics. At the same time, there are also claims that
   students' mathematical content knowledge could be highly related to
   creativity in mathematics, too. This paper reports on a study that
   investigated USA and Chinese high school students' mathematical content
   knowledge, their abilities in mathematical problem posing, and the
   relationships between students' mathematical content knowledge and their
   problem-posing abilities in mathematics.},

Title = {A case study of one instructor's lecture-based teaching of proof in
   abstract algebra: making sense of her pedagogical moves},

Abstract = {This paper is a case study of the teaching of an undergraduate abstract
   algebra course, in particular the way the instructor presented proofs.
   It describes a framework for proof writing based on Selden and Selden
   (2009) and the work of Alcock (2010) on modes of thought that support
   proof writing. The paper offers a case study of the teaching of a
   traditionally-taught abstract algebra course, including showing the
   range of practice as larger than previously described in research
   literature. This study describes the aspects of proof writing and modes
   of thought the instructor modeled for the students. The study finds that
   she frequently modeled the aspects of hierarchical structure and
   formal-rhetorical skills, and structural, critical, and instantiation
   modes of thought. This study also examines the instructor's attempts to
   involve the students in the proof writing process during class by asking
   questions and expecting responses. Finally, the study describes how
   those questions and responses were part of her proof presentation. The
   funneling pattern of Steinbring (1989) describes most of the question
   and answer discussions enacted in the class with most questions
   requiring a factual response. Yet, the instructional sequence can be
   also understood as modeling the way an expert in the discipline thinks
   and, as such, offering a different type of opportunity for student
   learning.},

Abstract = {It is our presupposition that there is still a need for more research
   about how classroom practices can exploit the use and power of
   visualization in mathematics education. The aim of this article is to
   contribute in this direction, investigating how visual representations
   can structure geometry activity in the classroom and discussing teaching
   practices that can facilitate students' visualization of mathematical
   objects. We present one illustrative episode that shows how drawings of
   geometrical figures have a powerful role in structuring and modifying
   the mathematical activity in the classroom. It was selected from a
   database that we have been building to investigate the learning of
   mathematics in public elementary schools in Brazil. The framework of
   Activity Theory helped in the characterization of the episode as a
   system of interconnected activities. We discuss the changes and
   transformations perceived in those activities; and we explore the idea
   of miniature cycles of learning actions to focus on the mathematical
   learning that is taking place. We describe the dynamics and the
   complexity of the ongoing activity in the calculation of areas; and, how
   drawings form a part, and show their influence, in it. We argue that
   part of this influence was associated with the contradiction between
   abstract mathematical ideas and their empirical representations,
   revealed by the tensions perceived in the activities analysed; and,
   simultaneously, that we could see as an impelling force for the learning
   of the rules and norms which regulate the use of visual representations
   in school mathematics.},

Abstract = {In this report, we offer a framework for analyzing the ways in which
   collaboration influences learners' building of mathematical arguments
   and thus promotes mathematical understanding. Building on a previous
   model used to analyze discursive practices of students engaged in

   and discuss their influence on the building of mathematical arguments
   and student agency. The framework is exemplified using data from a study
   of the development of mathematical reasoning in an urban sixth-grade

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the development of two grounded theories. One
   theory is mathematical and grounded in the work of university calculus
   students' collaborative development of mathematical methods for finding
   the volume of a solid of revolution, in response to mathematical
   necessity in problem solving, without prior instruction on solution
   methods. The second theory emerges from microlinguistic analysis of
   students' mathematical choices and use of warrants in substantial
   argumentation to communicate, clarify, and convince others of the
   validity of their conjectures and mathematical work. Our goal was to
   illuminate mathematical argumentation by collaborative groups of
   calculus students at a qualitative level of detail sufficient to reveal
   one view of how these students satisfied the creative drive for
   mathematical meaning, communication, and accuracy in problem solving as
   evidenced in one classroom over several days.},

Abstract = {Descriptions of methodologies that can be used to create items for
   assessing teachers' professionally situated knowledge are lacking in
   mathematics education research literature. In this study, researchers
   described and used the Delphi method to design an instrument to measure
   teachers' pedagogical content knowledge. The instrument focused on a
   specific area of middle school geometry and measurement, decomposing and
   recomposing figures in 1-D and 2-D. The Delphi methodology used included
   three rounds of surveys of a diverse panel of 20 experts. The data
   analysis and data collection were done reflectively. Initial items were
   developed based on the research literature in the field of geometry
   education and teacher knowledge. New categories for the analysis emerged
   from the data and were used to complete the analysis. Consensus among
   the experts was reached after the third round of surveys, producing the
   assessment instrument. The researchers described strengths and
   limitations of this methodology for designing assessment tools of
   teachers' knowledge. The researchers suggested that Delphi methodology
   could also be used to design and validate broader instruments related to
   other types of professional knowledge of teachers in different fields.},

Abstract = {The notion of equivalence relation is arguably one of the most
   fundamental ideas of mathematics. Accordingly, it plays an important
   role in teaching mathematics at all levels, whether explicitly or
   implicitly. Our success in introducing this notion for its own sake or
   as a means to teach other mathematical concepts, however, depends
   largely on our own conceptions of it. This paper considers various
   conceptions of equivalence, in history, in mathematics today, and in
   mathematics education. It reveals critical differences in the notion of
   equivalence at different points in history and a meaning for equivalence
   proposed by mathematicians and mathematics educators that is at variance
   with the ways that learners may think. These differences call into
   question the most popular view of the subject: that the mathematical
   notion of equivalence relation is the result of spelling out our
   experience of equivalence. Moreover, the findings of this study suggest
   that the standard definition of an equivalence relation is ill-chosen
   from a pedagogical point of view but well-crafted from a mathematical
   point of view.},

Abstract = {Technology is available and accessible in many mathematics classrooms.
   Adopting technology to support teaching and learning requires teachers
   to change their teaching practices. This paper reports the responses of
   a diverse cohort of 92 secondary mathematics teachers who chose to
   respond to an Australian state-wide survey (Mathematics with Technology
   Perceptions Survey) developed using a Theory of Planned Behaviour
   framework. The items discussed in this paper targeted mathematics
   teachers' perceptions of possible barriers and enablers to their
   intention to use technology in their teaching. The responses are varied
   but, overall, strength of agreement with enablers outweighed agreement
   with perceived barriers. However, it is clear that despite an overall
   positive attitude towards the use of technology for teaching
   mathematics, some perceived barriers to change are notable. It is,
   therefore, helpful if those responsible for professional development,
   promoting the use of technology, recognise and address these barriers as
   well as working to strengthening enablers.},

Abstract = {Scholars and teacher educators alike agree that teachers' beliefs and
   attitudes toward mathematics are key informants of teachers'
   instructional approaches. Therefore, it has become clear that, in
   addition to enriching preservice teachers' (PSTs) knowledge, teacher
   education programs should also create opportunities for prospective
   teachers to develop productive beliefs and attitudes toward teaching and
   learning mathematics. This study explored the effectiveness of a
   mathematics preparatory program based on the history of mathematics that
   aimed at enhancing PSTs' epistemological and efficacy beliefs and their
   attitudes toward mathematics. Using data from a questionnaire
   administered four times, the study traced the development of 94 PSTs'
   beliefs and attitudes over a period of 2 years. The analysis of these
   data showed changes in certain dimensions of the PSTs' beliefs and
   attitudes; however, other dimensions were found to change in the
   opposite direction to that expected. Differences were also found in the
   development of the PSTs' beliefs and attitudes according to their
   mathematical background. The data yielded from semi-structured follow-up
   interviews conducted with a convenience sample of PSTs largely
   corroborated the quantitative data and helped explain some of these
   changes. We discuss the effectiveness of the program considered herein
   and draw implications for the design of teacher education programs
   grounded in the history of mathematics.},

Abstract = {Prospective elementary teachers' (N=148) motivation to participate in
   whole-class discussions during mathematics content courses for teachers,
   as expressed in their own words on an open-ended questionnaire, were
   studied. Results indicated that prospective teachers were motivated by
   positive utility values for participating (to achieve a short-term goal
   of learning mathematics or a long-term goal of becoming a teacher), to
   demonstrate competence (to achieve performance-approach goals), or to
   help others (to achieve social goals). Negative utility values for
   participating were expressed by those who preferred to learn through
   actively listening. Five motivational profiles, as composed of
   interactions among motivational values, beliefs, goals and self-reported
   participation practices, were prevalent in this sample. Self-reported
   variations among participants' utility values and participation
   practices suggested that prospective teachers engaged differentially in
   opportunities to learn to communicate mathematically. Results provide
   pedagogical learner knowledge for mathematics teacher educators.},

Title = {Sociomathematical scaffolding as students engage in revising draft

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 29},
Abstract = {Instructors manage several tensions as they engage students in defining,
   conjecturing, and proving, including building on students' contributions
   while maintaining the integrity of certain mathematical norms. This
   paper presents a case study of a teacher-researcher who was particularly
   skilled in balancing these tensions in a laboratory setting. We
   introduce sociomathematical scaffolding, which refers to the scaffolding
   of normative aspects for mathematical discourse. We found that the
   teacher-researcher's sociomathematical scaffolding entailed inquiring
   into the students' intended meaning of their draft and then supporting
   students in revising their draft to adhere to mathematical norms. We
   illustrate this pattern in three episodes in which the
   teacher-researcher supported a pair of students to revise their drafted
   (1) definition of unbounded above sequences, (2) conjecture of the
   Archimedean Property, and (3) proof by contraction of the Archimedean
   Property.},

Abstract = {The training of non-specialists, particularly engineers, in mathematics
   requires designing specific didactic proposals that make the importance
   of mathematics evident. One approach to creating such proposals consists
   in analyzing the mathematics used in authentic contexts of engineering
   research and then effectuating a didactic transposition to mathematics
   teaching. To this end, in this research, we use elements of the
   anthropological theory of the didactic and the methodology of didactic
   engineering. Initially, we analyze the blind source separation method, a
   case of inverse modeling widely used in numerous engineering contexts
   (e.g., telecommunications, acoustics, geophysics, biosignal analysis).
   More specifically, we examine the algorithm based on the Ax = b matrix
   model and its use in a signal processing context. Based on this
   analysis, we designed a didactic device that focuses the study on a
   simulated signal mixture of pure tones and implemented it in two
   first-year university mathematics courses in the virtual modality. This
   article reports the results of the students' first approximation to
   mathematical modeling activity in a setting of authentic research in
   engineering using a blind source separation method.},

Abstract = {Teachers' questioning plays an essential role in shaping collective
   argumentative discourse. This paper demonstrated that rationality
   dimensions in teacher questions can be assessed by adapting Habermas'
   three components of rationality. By coordinating Habermas' construct
   with Toulmin's model for argumentation, this paper investigated how two
   secondary mathematics teachers used rational questioning to support
   student participation in collective argumentation. This paper identified
   various ways in which two participating teachers used rational
   questioning to support student participation in argumentation via
   contributions of argument components. The results establish a
   theoretical connection between the use of rational questions and
   students' contributions of components of arguments. The results
   indicated that not all rational questions were associated with a
   component of argument, and rational questions may additionally support
   argumentation in general for the development of a culture of
   rationality. The study has implications in terms of theory and
   professional development of teachers.},

Title = {Mathematics in the informal setting of an art studio: students'
   visuospatial thinking processes in a studio thinking-based environment},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate seventh-grade students' visuospatial
   thinking processes in an art studio environment, where students were
   engaged with geometrically rich artworks. The students were asked to
   observe minimalist artworks, then create and critique their own and
   others' artworks based on the Studio Thinking Framework. Data were
   collected through interviews conducted with students, video recordings
   in the studio, and students' documents (sketches, artworks, and notes).
   The data were analyzed based on previous studies on spatial thinking and
   emergent data. The study's findings indicate that the Studio
   Thinking-based environment has the potential to elicit students'
   visuospatial thinking processes, mainly in recognizing shapes,
   decomposing and composing shapes, patterning, and transforming shapes
   rigidly and non-rigidly (scaling). The present study, which includes
   accounts of three studio works, suggests an emergent framework for the
   characterization of visuospatial thinking within a particular
   art-math-related environment. The findings of the study shed light on
   other studies on visual arts and mathematics education and on
   mathematical thinking and learning in informal learning settings.},

Title = {Undergraduates' conceptions of mathematics teaching and learning: an
   empirical study},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {109},

Abstract = {Previous research in mathematics education has explored teachers'
   conceptions of mathematics and its teaching and learning, and how their
   instructional tendencies (e.g., ``traditional{''}, ``technological{''},
   ``spontaneous{''} and ``investigative{''}) relate to these conceptions.
   However, empirical evidence on this topic from large samples of
   pre-service teachers is limited. This study adapts and validates an
   instrument originally designed for in-service teachers to analyse the
   conceptions of mathematics and mathematics teaching and learning. This
   was done in a sample of undergraduate students in several different
   degree programmes (primary education, mathematics, and the education
   itinerary in psychology) in a Spanish university. Existing theory about
   instructional tendencies and conceptions of mathematics teaching and
   learning that was developed in the context of in-service teachers is
   then re-examined in the context of empirical evidence from this sample
   of individuals (all potential future teachers) without teaching
   experience. Results show that items from the instrument can be separated
   into four factors focussed on investigative stances, the role of
   textbooks, the role of teachers and lesson planning. Individual
   participants are not characterised by single tendencies; rather, they
   can be described in terms of several combinations of tendencies, grouped
   into four clusters. In line with the previous literature on in-service
   teachers, results suggest that conceptions of mathematics and its
   teaching and learning are not best captured by rigid, sharply delineated
   profiles. Rather, individuals configure their own conceptions in terms
   of combinations of different characteristics of prototypical tendencies.},

Abstract = {Narrative, first-person accounts of a collective, traumatic event
   preserve the authenticity of the experience and defend against
   inaccurate retrospective idealizations. Such artifacts allow us time to
   process the event, extract the lessons it has for us, and to bring these
   lessons to bear on our practices. I offer my own narrative here, as a
   practitioner and researcher, of daily experiences of teaching
   mathematics in the USA during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Sudden
   perturbations to our regular educational practices expose ways in which
   those practices are incomplete or outright unstable. This, in turn,
   troubles the theories underpinning our practices. I offer my narrative
   as a point of communal reflection on what we do and know, and how we
   might do and know it better.},

Abstract = {Mathematics self-schemas are students' cognitive generalisations of
   their selves in learning mathematics (Ng in Educational Psychology,
   34(6), 730-762, 2014). These salient subject-based self-conceptions are
   conceptualised as a cognitive frame guiding students' coping responses
   when dealing with challenging mathematics tasks. In study 1, 271 Year 9
   Australian students were classified into positive, average, and negative
   schematics based on their responses to a survey questionnaire. It was
   found that compared to the other two schematic groups, positive
   schematics were more motivated, used adaptive coping strategies to deal
   with difficult mathematical tasks, and were less likely to avoid
   challenging tasks. In study 2, positive and negative schematics'
   performance in a difficult mathematics test was compared. These two
   groups of schematic participants (n = 74) were drawn from study 1. Prior
   to taking the test, compared to negative schematics, positive schematics
   had higher performance targets and held stronger intention to complete
   the test with goals focusing on learning and performance. During the
   free-choice session, more positive schematics than their negative
   counterparts attempted an additional set of test questions. On receiving
   negative feedback about their test performance, significantly more
   positive schematics considered the test inaccurate and were willing to
   retake the test. Positive schematics, as expected, performed
   significantly better than did their negative counterparts in the test.
   Convergent findings derived from these two studies showed that positive
   and negative schematic students coped with challenging mathematics in a
   self-congruent manner.},

Abstract = {The use of original sources is a useful resource not only to be used
   with secondary school students but also with prospective mathematics
   teachers. In this work, we designed a series of tasks based on a
   fragment excerpted from Clairaut'selements de Geometrieto be carried out
   with 24 participants enrolled on a Masters' Degree in Secondary School
   Mathematics Teaching. This fragment was chosen both due to its content
   and to its narrative structure and our main goal was to determine which
   elements of professional knowledge were used by prospective secondary
   mathematics teachers when reading this fragment. In order to do so, we
   used the MKT model as an analytical tool and we also assessed some
   aspects related to literacy skills. The prospective teachers were able
   to recognize mathematical and pedagogical components within the source
   that relate to their future practice. In addition, the participant's
   literacy skills seem to play a role in the richness of their reading.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Comparing probabilities is a useful skill in life. Binary choice tasks
   are popular means in research on probabilistic reasoning. Falk,
   Yudilevich-Assouline, and Elstein (Educational Studies in Mathematics,
   81(2), 207-233 2012) noted that many of these tasks contain design
   flaws. We designed and evaluated an extended and improved binary choice
   item set. In each trial, children were shown two boxes containing
   desired and undesired elements and had to identify the best box to
   blindly draw from. We took into account four necessary item set
   characteristics: (un)desired elements in the correct box, total number
   of elements in the correct box, and difference between desired and
   undesired elements in the correct box. Furthermore, some extensions to
   Falk et al.'s design (2012) were implemented: items in which one box
   certainly provided a desired element, items with three competing colors
   of elements, and items with lower ``countability{''} of the elements.
   Results showed that extensions added to the design did not imperil
   internal consistency and validity. Younger children were more likely to
   give correct answers when the correct box contained more desired
   elements and older children are better at comparing probabilities than
   younger ones overall.},

Title = {Discourse competence as important part of academic language proficiency
   in mathematics classrooms: the case of explaining to learn and learning
   to explain},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {99},
Number = {2},
Pages = {161-179},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Language, which plays a special role for the learning of mathematics, is
   investigated in this article for the specific discourse practice of
   explaining during whole-class discussions: On the one hand, explaining
   is a medium for learning since school cannot be thought of without
   communication. On the other hand, students at the beginning of secondary
   school are still in the process of language acquisition and are also
   still learning how to communicate mathematically. Thus, students are
   learning to explain in mathema-tics classrooms. This empirical study
   focuses on the overall question of how discourse competence,
   participation in classroom discourse, and mathematical learning
   opportunities are related. For that purpose, the approach of
   Interactional Discourse Analysis is introduced to mathematics education
   research and coordinated with the Interactional-Epistemic Perspective
   from mathematics education. The relevance of explaining is shown
   theoretically and empirically and a description is given of how limited
   discourse competence and limited epistemic participation proceed across
   situations.},

Abstract = {The notion of flow of a proof encapsulates mathematical, didactical, and
   contextual aspects of proof presentation. A proof may have different
   flows, depending on the lecturer's choices regarding its presentation.
   Adopting Perelman's New Rhetoric (PNR) as a theoretical framework, we
   designed methods to assess aspects of the flow of a proof. We present a
   case study from a Number Theory class at the beginning undergraduate
   level, focusing on an intervention concerning one lesson given in two
   consecutive years. The intervention consisted of a discussion with the
   lecturer about findings from Year-1 and potential changes in the flow of
   the proof before the Year-2 lesson. We analyze two aspects of the flow
   of the proof: the scope and organization of the argumentation and the
   presence (in the PNR sense) of different elements. Our analysis revealed
   that the intervention caused global and local changes in the flow and
   that PNR enables us to capture these changes.},

Abstract = {Mathematicians commonly distinguish two modes of work in the discipline:
   Problem solving, and theory building. Mathematics education offers many
   opportunities to learn problem solving. This paper explores the
   possibility, and value, of designing instructional activities that
   provide supported opportunities for students to learn mathematics
   theory-building practices. It begins by providing a definition of these
   theory-building practices on the basis of which to formulate principles
   for the design of such instructional activities. The paper offers
   theoretical arguments that theory-building practices serve not only the
   synthesizing role that they play in disciplinary mathematics, but they
   also have the potential to enrich learners' reasoning powers and enhance
   their problem solving skills. Examples of problem sets designed for this
   purpose are provided and analyzed.},

Abstract = {The notion of ``praxeology{''} from the anthropological theory of the
   didactic (ATD) can be used as a framework to approach what has recently
   been called the networking of theories in mathematics education.
   Theories are interpreted as research praxeologies, and different
   modalities of ``dialogues{''} between research praxeologies are
   proposed, based on alternatively considering the main features and
   proposals of one theory from the perspective of the other. To illustrate
   this networking methodology, we initiate a dialogue between APOS
   (action-process-object-schema) and the ATD itself. It starts from the
   theoretical component of both research praxeologies followed by the
   technological and technical ones. Both dialogue modalities and the
   resulting insights are illustrated, and the elements of APOS and the ATD
   that the dialogue can promote and develop are underlined. The results
   found indicate that a complete dialogue taking into account all
   components of research praxeologies appears as an unavoidable step in
   the networking of research praxeologies.},

Abstract = {Part of the research community that has followed the Early Algebra
   paradigm is currently delimiting the differences between arithmetic
   thinking and algebraic thinking. This trend could prevent new research
   approaches to the problem of learning algebra, hiding the importance of
   considering an arithmetico-algebraic thinking, a new approach which
   underpins the construction of a cognitive structure that links both
   types of thinking. This paper proposes a theoretical and practical
   framework for a learning approach that supports the construction of a
   cognitive structure which fosters arithmetico-algebraic thinking at the
   beginning of secondary school by means of cultural and technological
   activities relating to polygonal numbers.},

Title = {Where form and substance meet: using the narrative approach of
   <i>re-storying</i> to generate research findings and community
   rapprochement in (university) mathematics education},

Abstract = {Storytelling is an engaging way through which lived experience can be
   shared and reflected upon, and a tool through which difference,
   diversity-and even conflict-can be acknowledged and elaborated upon.
   Narrative approaches to research bring the richness and vibrancy of
   storytelling into how data is collected and interpretations of it
   shared. In this paper, I demonstrate the potency of the narrative
   approach of re-storying for a certain type of university mathematics
   education research (non-deficit, non-prescriptive, context-specific,
   example-centred and mathematically focused) conducted at the interface
   of two communities: mathematics education and mathematics. I do so
   through reference to Amongst Mathematicians (Nardi, 2008), a study
   carried out in collaboration with 20 university mathematicians from six
   UK mathematics departments. The study deployed re-storying to present
   data and analyses in the form of a dialogue between two fictional, yet
   entirely data-grounded, characters-M, mathematician, and RME, researcher
   in mathematics education. In the dialogues, the typically conflicting
   epistemologies-and mutual perceptions of such epistemologies-of the two
   communities come to the fore as do the feasibility-of, benefits-from,
   obstacles-in and conditions-for collaboration between these communities.
   First, I outline the use of narrative approaches in mathematics
   education research. Then, I introduce the study and its use of
   re-storying, illustrating this with an example: the construction of a
   dialogue from interview data in which the participating mathematicians
   discuss the potentialities and pitfalls of visualisation in university
   mathematics teaching. I conclude by outlining re-storying as a vehicle
   for community rapprochement achieved through generating and sharing
   research findings-the substance of research-in forms that reflect the
   fundamental principles and aims that underpin this research. My
   conclusions resonate with sociocultural constructs that view mathematics
   teacher education as contemporary praxis and the aforementioned
   inter-community discussion as taking place within a third space.},

Abstract = {Little is known about students' emotions in the field of Mathematics
   Education that go beyond students' emotions in problem solving. To start
   filling this gap this qualitative research has the aim to identify
   emotional experiences of undergraduate mathematics students in Linear
   Algebra courses. In order to obtain data, retrospective focus group
   interviews were carried out with 27 students. Data analysis is based on
   the theory of cognitive structure of emotions, which specifies eliciting
   conditions for each emotion and the variables that affect intensity of
   emotions. Results show that the participants' emotional experiences in
   Linear Algebra courses are: satisfaction and disappointment emotions,
   fear emotions, distress emotions and self-reproach emotions. These
   emotions are triggered by the appraisal of different situations like the
   difficulty attributed to Linear Algebra courses, solving problems,
   asking questions in class, going to the blackboard to solve problems and
   failure in a course. The students' emotional experiences are based on
   their appraisal of the situations in terms of specific goals and
   standards. Some implications for future research on affect in
   Mathematics Education are discussed.},

Abstract = {A model solution to a proof question on an examination is explored and
   subjected to a detailed analysis in terms of Toulmin's scheme of
   argumentation. In doing so, the ways in which the scheme has been
   variously used in the mathematics education and philosophical literature
   are contrasted. The analysis raises a number of issues concerning the
   scheme as described by Toulmin and as modified by other authors and
   suggests ways in which one aspect of the scheme might be reinterpreted.
   The final analysis of the proof provides insight into what examiners may
   be expecting from their students in terms of the level of explicit
   argument they consider essential and the importance played by the focus
   of the subject matter.},

Abstract = {This study examined 361 Chinese and 345 Singaporean sixth-grade
   students' performance and problem-solving strategies for solving 14
   problems about speed. By focusing on students from two distinct
   high-performing countries in East Asia, we provide a useful perspective
   on the differences that exist in the preparation and problem-solving
   strategies of these groups of students. The strategy analysis indicates
   that the Chinese sample used algebraic strategies more frequently and
   more successfully than the Singaporean sample, although the Chinese
   sample used a limited variety of strategies. The Singaporean sample's
   use of model-drawing produced a performance advantage on one problem by
   converting multiplication/division of fractions into
   multiplication/division of whole numbers. Several suggestions regarding
   teaching and learning of mathematical problem solving, algebra, and
   problems about speed and its related concepts of ratio and proportion
   are made.},

Volume = {86},

Pages = {39-59},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This case study illustrates how a 2nd-grade child, Violet, used an
   ordinal view of number to reason about positive and negative integers
   and arithmetic involving integers. Violet's ordinal view of number
   facilitated her ability to reason about and correctly solve some
   integer-related problems and constrained her solutions to others. We
   demonstrate how Violet's thinking evolved over time while she extended
   the properties of whole numbers and addition and subtraction to the
   integers. Using this case study as a basis, we propose a series of
   developmental milestones that build toward one's understanding of
   integers and integer arithmetic in an order-based way. We believe that
   understanding Violet's order-based reasoning can help us listen to other
   children.},

Abstract = {In order to describe and analyze teachers' orchestrating of classroom
   discourse, detailed descriptions of teachers' comments and questions are
   critical. The purpose of this article is to suggest new concepts that
   enable us to describe in detail how teachers use or do not use students'
   comments to work with the mathematical content. Five teachers from upper
   primary school (grades five to seven, students aged 10 to 13) were
   studied. Beginning with the analysis of a pattern where the teacher
   gives a confirmation followed by a question that indicates a rejection,
   their practices form the basis for the development of 13 categories of
   teacher comments. These categories are then grouped into redirecting,
   progressing, and focusing actions. The categories and their groupings
   shed light on tools and techniques which these teachers use to make
   student strategies visible, to make students justify, apply and assess,
   to ensure progress towards a conclusion, or to redirect the students
   into alternative approaches. These findings can help us develop in the
   direction of a more profound understanding of how communication affects
   learning.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to contribute insights into how
   collaborative activity can help promote students' mathematical
   understanding. A group of six high school students (15- to 16-year olds)
   worked together on a challenging probability task as part of a larger,
   after-school, longitudinal study on students' development of
   mathematical ideas in problem-solving settings. The students solved the
   problem and produced a valid justification of their solution. This study
   shows that collaborative activity can help promote students'
   mathematical understanding by providing opportunities for students to
   critically reexamine how they make claims from facts and also enable
   them to build on one another's ideas to construct more sophisticated
   ways of reasoning. Implications for classroom teaching and ideas for
   future research are also discussed. The study helps address a documented
   need for a better understanding of how mathematical learning evolves in
   social settings.},

Abstract = {The Thinking with Data project (TWD) expands on current notions of data
   literacy by (1) focusing on proportional reasoning as key to data
   literacy and (2) leveraging the non-mathematics disciplines to engage
   students in deep thinking about the context of data and the application
   of proportionality. A set of four 2-week, sequential modules for
   cross-disciplinary implementation in seventh-grade classrooms was
   designed and evaluated. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we found
   that student data literacy was increased through the focused integration
   of social studies, mathematics, science, and English language arts. In
   this article, we describe our theoretical approach to designing and
   implementing the modules, report on student learning gains in
   mathematics, and describe teacher reactions to the materials. In sum,
   our study provides evidence that the TWD approach has the potential to
   build data literacy while also allowing students to learn core
   discipline-based content standards.},

Abstract = {In this study which was part of the DISUM-project, 224 ninth graders
   from 14 German classes from middle track schools (Realschule) were asked
   about their enjoyment, interest, value and self-efficacy expectations
   concerning three types of mathematical problems: intra-mathematical
   problems, word problems and modelling problems. Enjoyment, interest,
   value and self-efficacy were assessed before and after a ten-lesson
   teaching unit promoting modelling competency related to the topics
   ``Pythagoras' theorem{''} and ``linear functions{''}. The study aimed to
   answer the following research questions: (1) Do students' enjoyment,
   value, interest and self-efficacy expectations differ depending on the
   type of task? (2) Does the treatment of modelling problems in classroom
   instruction influence these variables? (3) Are there any differential
   effects for different ways of teaching modelling problems, including a
   ``directive{''}, teacher-centred instruction and an
   ``operative-strategic{''}, more student-centred instruction emphasising
   group work and strategic scaffolding by the teacher? The findings show
   that there were no differences in students' enjoyment, interest, value
   and self-efficacy between the three types of tasks. However, teaching
   oriented towards modelling problems had positive effects on some of the
   student variables, with the student-centred teaching method producing
   the most beneficial effects.},

Abstract = {Although proof comprehension is fundamental in advanced undergraduate
   mathematics courses, there has been limited research on what it means to
   understand a mathematical proof at this level and how such understanding
   can be assessed. In this paper, we address these issues by presenting a
   multidimensional model for assessing proof comprehension in
   undergraduate mathematics. Building on Yang and Lin's (Educational
   Studies in Mathematics 67:59-76, 2008) model of reading comprehension of
   proofs in high school geometry, we contend that in undergraduate
   mathematics a proof is not only understood in terms of the meaning,
   logical status, and logical chaining of its statements but also in terms
   of the proof's high-level ideas, its main components or modules, the
   methods it employs, and how it relates to specific examples. We
   illustrate how each of these types of understanding can be assessed in
   the context of a proof in number theory.},

Abstract = {Working with Navajo Indian informants in Arizona, USA we became aware of
   the capabilities of children and adults to find their way in vast and
   clearly ``chaotic{''} canyons. One thing we did was describe what people
   actually did and said about their ways to find the way back home in such
   contexts. A second one was to use these data in order to build a
   curriculum book for a bicultural school on the Navajo reservation. We
   start from this example to ask what the political choices are, which we
   confront when working with such material: how much mathematics (or is it
   Mathematics) is needed in daily life? And what mathematics should we
   promote or develop, without becoming colonialist again? In Section 2, we
   discuss the meaning and the status of ethnomathematics, proposing that
   it would be the generic category which allows for a more systematic and
   comparative study of the whole domain of mathematical practices. In
   Section 3, we introduce the concept of multimathemacy (after
   multiliteracy) to discuss the political agenda of ethnomathematics. We
   argue that multimathemacy should be the basis of the curriculum in order
   to guarantee optimal survival value for every learner.},

Abstract = {In the United States, undergraduates-regardless of their field of
   study-generally must complete a mathematics course to meet
   breadth-of-study requirements. This report is aimed at providing a
   research foundation for practical efforts to improve teaching and
   learning in such college mathematics service courses (e.g., college
   algebra, liberal arts mathematics, business calculus). The case
   participant, Professor Kale, was a PhD mathematician with 12 years of
   college teaching experience, 6 years as a graduate student and 6 years
   after the doctorate. He and students in both of his classes agreed to
   the daily video recording of their meetings for an entire semester.
   Through constant-comparative analysis of videos and extensive interviews
   with Professor Kale, as well as brief interviews with his students and
   other members of the department, we derived a description of discursive
   patterns in Kale's classes. We conclude with possible implications for
   future work in college mathematics service course research and teaching.},

Abstract = {The mixed method sequential nested study examines whether and how the
   cognitive type of teachers' content knowledge is associated with student
   achievement, and correlated with teaching practice. In the context of
   this study, the cognitive type refers to the kind of teacher content
   knowledge and thinking processes required to accomplish a task
   successfully, in terms of knowledge of facts and procedures (Type 1),
   knowledge of concepts and connections (Type 2), and/or knowledge of
   models and generalizations (Type 3). A sample of 102 middle school
   mathematics teachers (grades 6-8) was assigned to the study from a
   number of school districts in an urban area in the Southwestern US.
   Teachers were tested using the Teacher Content Knowledge Survey. Student
   level data of about 2,400 middle grades students' standardized test
   passing rates including percentage of students meeting the state
   standards by objectives were collected. The type of teachers' content
   knowledge was assessed and tested for association with student
   achievement on the state-mandated standardized test using multivariate
   methods including tests for variance and independence. The nested
   research consisted of three phases. Substudy-1 focused on quantitative
   analysis of the association between cognitive type of teacher content
   knowledge and student achievement. Substudy-2 aimed at the correlation
   between cognitive type of teacher content knowledge and teaching
   practice. Finally, substudy-3 was a case study on examining middle
   grades mathematics teachers' knowledge and understanding of fraction
   division.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how mathematicians build meaning through
   communicative activity involving talk, gesture and diagram. In the
   course of describing mathematical concepts, mathematicians use these
   semiotic resources in ways that blur the distinction between the
   mathematical and physical world. We shall argue that mathematical
   meaning of eigenvectors depends strongly on both time and motion-hence,
   on physical interpretations of mathematical abstractions-which are
   dimensions of thinking that are typically deliberately absent from
   formal, written definition of the concept. We shall also show how
   gesture and talk contribute differently and uniquely to mathematical
   conceptualisation and further elaborate the claim that diagrams provide
   an essential mediating role between the two.},

Abstract = {This paper presents results of a longitudinal study in the transition to
   independent graduate studies in mathematics. The analysis of the data
   collected from 24 students doing a PhD in mathematics revealed the
   existence of three transitional stages within the PhD degree, namely
   Adjustment, Expertise and Articulation. The focus is on the first two
   transitional stages, since the data collection focused mainly on these.
   Based on the first two transitional stages and the students' ways of
   dealing with them, which were called `survival strategies', three types
   of students were identified. The importance of motivation for each
   transitional stage and the successful transition overall are considered
   as well.},

Abstract = {This study explored students' understanding of a logical structure in
   defining the limit of a sequence, focusing on the relationship between
   epsilon and N. The subjects of this study were college students who had
   already encountered the concept of limit but did not have any experience
   with rigorous proofs using the epsilon-N definition. This study
   suggested two statements, each of which is written by using a
   relationship between epsilon and N, similar to the epsilon-N definition.
   By analyzing the students' responses to the validity of the statements
   as definitions of the limit of a sequence, students' understanding of
   such a relationship was classified into five major categories. This
   paper discusses some essential components that students must
   conceptualize in order properly to understand the relationship between e
   and N in defining the limit of a sequence.},

Abstract = {In this article, we focus on a group of 39 prospective elementary
   (grades K-6) teachers who had rich experiences with proof, and we
   examine their ability to construct proofs and evaluate their own
   constructions. We claim that the combined ``construction-evaluation{''}
   activity helps illuminate certain aspects of prospective teachers' and
   presumably other individuals' understanding of proof that tend to defy
   scrutiny when individuals are asked to evaluate given arguments. For
   example, some prospective teachers in our study provided empirical
   arguments to mathematical statements, while being aware that their
   constructions were invalid. Thus, although these constructions
   considered alone could have been taken as evidence of an empirical
   conception of proof, the additional consideration of prospective
   teachers' evaluations of their own constructions overruled this
   interpretation and suggested a good understanding of the distinction
   between proofs and empirical arguments. We offer a possible account of
   our findings, and we discuss implications for research and instruction.},

Title = {Approach to mathematical problem solving and students' belief systems:
   two case studies},

Abstract = {The goal of the study reported here is to gain a better understanding of
   the role of belief systems in the approach phase to mathematical problem
   solving. Two students of high academic performance were selected based
   on a previous exploratory study of 61 students 12-13 years old. In this
   study we identified different types of approaches to problems that
   determine the behavior of students in the problem-solving process. The
   research found two aspects that explain the students' approaches to
   problem solving: (1) the presence of a dualistic belief system
   originating in the student's school experience; and (2) motivation
   linked to beliefs regarding the difficulty of the task. Our results
   indicate that there is a complex relationship between students' belief
   systems and approaches to problem solving, if we consider a wide variety
   of beliefs about the nature of mathematics and problem solving and
   motivational beliefs, but that it is not possible to establish
   relationships of causality between specific beliefs and problem-solving
   activity (or vice versa).},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the construction of systems of competence in two
   middle school mathematics classrooms. Drawing on analyses of discourse
   from videotaped classroom sessions, this paper documents the ways that
   agency and accountability were distributed in the classrooms through
   interactions between the teachers and students as they worked on
   mathematical content. In doing so, we problematize the assumption that
   competencies are simply attributes of individuals that can be externally
   defined. Instead, we propose a concept of individual competence as an
   attribute of a person's participation in an activity system such as a
   classroom. In this perspective, what counts as ``competent{''} gets
   constructed in particular classrooms, and can therefore look very
   different from setting to setting. The implications of the ways that
   competence can be defined are discussed in terms of future research and
   equitable learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {This essay focuses on the role of mathematics and Israeli mathematicians
   in serving the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, including

   ministerial meetings that discussed how to control the newly conquered
   people and land as discussed by Shafer Raviv (Journal of Contemporary
   History, 55(1), 161-181, 2018 and Middle Eastern Studies, 57(2),
   342-356, 2021) as well as mathematical formulas created 40 years later
   as part of an Israeli policy to restrict food supplies to the Gaza
   Strip. It sheds light on the way in which mathematicians and mathematics
   can be employed to maintain and justify a racialized system of control.
   Drawing on Bonilla-Silva's (American Sociological Review, 62(3),
   465-480, 1997 and Journal of Political Ideologies, 8(1), 63-82, 2003)
   racialized social systems approach, the essay argues that mathematics
   and mathematicians professionalize and legitimize the dominant racial
   discourse in the Israeli military which, in turn, shapes the social and
   racial discourse in Israeli society that privileges Israeli Jews over
   Palestinians.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the aim is to make a theoretical contribution by focusing
   on the origin, characteristics, and potential values of the concepts of
   instrumental and relational understanding. Five characteristics are
   identified to make it easier to operationalise the concepts and use them
   as an analytical framework. There is also a focus on how the concepts
   are closely related to two rationales for learning, the instrumental and
   the social rationale. The potential values of the concepts and their
   rationales are shown by using them to suggest a revision of the van
   Hiele framework and to analyse three empirical examples concerning young
   students' understanding of triangles and a cylinder.},

Abstract = {This study foregrounds three students who are regarded by their teachers
   as being in special educational needs in mathematics (SEM) and these
   same students voicing what inclusion in mathematics education means to
   them. In this study, inclusion is defined as processes of participation.
   Discourse analysis was applied when analysing these students' voices of
   inclusion in mathematics education in two inclusive mathematics
   classrooms, with both classes aiming to include every student in the
   mathematics education. The three main Discourses which were identified
   were the Discourse of assessment, the Discourse of being in a
   mathematics classroom setting, and the Discourse of accessibility in
   mathematics education. The analysis of the Discourses indicates that
   they were affected by wider sociopolitical discourses. Furthermore, when
   inclusion is regarded as processes of participation in mathematics
   education, the results indicate that participation becomes more complex.
   Therefore, in this process, both ideological and societal issues, as
   well as individual and subject-specific issues, must be considered in
   the educational endeavour.},

Abstract = {Offering explanations is a central part of teaching mathematics, and
   understanding those explanations is a vital activity for learners. Given
   this, it is natural to ask what makes a good mathematical explanation.
   This question has received surprisingly little attention in the
   mathematics education literature, perhaps because the field has no
   agreed method by which explanation quality can be reliably assessed. In
   this paper, we explore this issue by asking whether mathematicians and
   undergraduates agree with each other about explanation quality. A corpus
   of 10 explanations produced by 10 mathematicians was used. Using a
   comparative judgement method, we analysed 320 paired comparisons from 16
   mathematicians and 320 from 32 undergraduate students. We found that
   both mathematicians and undergraduates were able to reliably assess the
   quality of a set of mathematical explanations. Furthermore, the
   assessments were largely consistent across the two groups. Implications
   for theories of mathematical explanation are discussed. We conclude by
   arguing that comparative judgement is a promising technique for
   exploring explanation quality.},

Abstract = {Drawing bar diagrams has been shown to improve performance on
   mathematical word problems wherein the relational keyword is consistent
   with the required arithmetic operation. This study extends this by
   testing the effectiveness of bar diagram drawing for word problems with
   an inconsistent keyword-arithmetic operation mapping. Seventy-five fifth
   graders solved consistent and inconsistent word problems while
   encouraged to draw bar diagrams. For each word problem, we assessed
   problem type (consistent/inconsistent), performance (correct/incorrect),
   and bar diagrams (accurate/inaccurate/no drawing). Overall, bar diagram
   drawing was associated with increased performance on both consistent and
   inconsistent word problems, but the strongest benefits of drawing were
   found for inconsistent word problems. For inconsistent word problems,
   bar diagram accuracy was more clearly related to performance (accurate
   bar diagrams related to correct answers, but inaccurate ones to
   incorrect answers) than for consistent word problems. We conclude that
   bar diagram drawing provides an effective graphical support for solving
   inconsistent word problems.},

Abstract = {When it comes to choosing tasks, values can have a significant impact.
   This study explores teachers' values as they choose one task from among
   three that they believe will have the most potential to occasion
   mathematical creativity in the classroom. Participants' analyses of each
   task, as well as their reasons for choosing one task as most preferred,
   were analyzed in terms of task features and cognitive demands, as well
   as their explicit reference to fluency, flexibility, and originality.
   Two values shared by most participants were having several solution
   paths and a task that would challenge students. Of particular interest
   are task features and cognitive demands that were associated with a task
   at the initial stage of analysis but were not mentioned as a reason for
   choosing that task as occasioning mathematical creativity. Dilemmas and
   challenges regarding the study of values are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on empirical results about the influence of two
   different teaching designs on the development of tertiary students'
   modelling competency and attitudes towards modelling. A total of 144
   first year engineering students were exposed to a diagnostic entrance
   test, a modelling unit consisting of five lessons with ten tasks,
   enframed by a pre- and a post-test, and at the end a questionnaire on
   attitudes towards mathematical modelling. Similar to the German DISUM
   study, in the modelling unit, one group of participants followed an
   independence-oriented teaching style, aiming at a balance between
   students' independent work and teacher's guidance, while two other
   groups were taught according to a more traditional teacher-guided style.
   Linear mixed regression models were used to compare pre- and post-test
   results. The results show that all groups had significant learning
   progress, although there is much room for further improvement, and that
   the group taught according to the independence-oriented design had the
   biggest competency growth. In addition, this group exhibited more
   positive attitudes than the other groups in five of six attitudinal
   aspects.},

Abstract = {Though there is an extensive research literature on understanding and
   assessing individual modeling competencies, less attention has been
   given to characterizing the social context of the classroom in which
   modeling occurs. Yet a classroom's culture of modeling-its negotiated
   system of beliefs and values about the nature of modeling and what
   constitutes a complete, satisfactory solution to a modeling problem-has
   a shaping influence on its members' participation in modeling
   activities. Devising a means of assessing classroom modeling cultures is
   thus a crucial task for both research and praxis. In this article, we
   present an approach to operationally defining and assessing classroom
   modeling cultures, which is (a) based in quantitative analyses of
   discourse during whole-class presentations of modeling solutions, and
   (b) grounded in research in individual modeling competencies. We show
   how our assessment distinguishes the classroom modeling cultures of
   different classrooms and how it captures shifts over time in the
   modeling culture of a given classroom. Finally, we accompany our
   quantitative results with interpretive analyses of presentation
   discourse, to triangulate and to attribute meaning to the patterns our
   assessment detects. Our primary data sources include video recorded
   presentation and Q\&A sessions for three modeling activities in each of
   two US middle school (Grades 5-8) classrooms. Our assessment approach is
   a significant contribution because it operationalizes the construct of a
   classroom's modeling culture, in terms that highlight potential
   connections with the research literature of individual modeling
   competencies. It therefore invites modeling research that coordinates
   learning and development across individual and social levels.},

Title = {Using large-scale data to determine pupils' strategies and errors in
   missing value number equations},

Abstract = {The goal of this study is to show a novel way of using large-scale data
   (N = 6203) to identify pupils' strategies when solving missing value
   number equations. It is based on the assumption that wrong numerical
   results appearing more frequently than would be the case if they were
   consequences of random guessing can be expected to be underlain by a
   pupil's rational, theoretically justifiable, solving procedure. We
   determined all of the numerical results suggested by the pupils in the
   study for three problems with the same format and classified them based
   on their occurrence. Possible solving procedures leading to them were
   inferred using a priori analysis. Next, we identified pupils' strategies
   based on the anticipated solving procedures in two problems of the same
   format and validated them by comparing them to the pupils' results in
   the third problem and to the pupils' whole test result. We identified
   six strategies, some of them underlain by clearly identified procedures.
   Our analysis showed a high predictive power of the identified pupils'
   strategies for their achievement in the mathematics test written 3 years
   later and in a more difficult problem of the same format. Our study has
   implications for test makers and teacher practice.},

   beliefs is confronted with methodological issues as for traditionally
   used self-report instruments with closed items, problems with social
   desirability, validity, and capturing domain-specific aspects of beliefs
   have been reported. Therefore, a new instrument with open items has been
   developed to capture mathematics-related epistemological beliefs,
   focusing on the justification of knowledge. Extending a previous study,
   the study at hand uses a larger and more diverse sample as well as a
   refined methodology. In total, 581 mathematics students (Bachelor of
   Science as well as pre-service teachers) completed the belief
   questionnaire and a test for mathematical critical thinking. The results
   confirm that beliefs can empirically be distinguished into belief
   position and belief argumentation, with only the latter being correlated
   to critical thinking.},

Title = {To add or to multiply in open problems? Unraveling children's relational
   preference using a mixed-method approach},

Abstract = {Previous research demonstrated that some children inappropriately solve
   multiplicative missing-value word problems additively, while others
   inappropriately solve additive missing-value word problems
   multiplicatively. Besides lacking skills, children's preference for
   additive or multiplicative relations has been shown to contribute to
   those errors. The present research, using a mixed-method approach,
   investigated the nature of upper primary school children's relational
   preference by empirically examining characteristics of intuitions that
   had been postulated previously. After administering a pre-test, selected
   children who preferred additive or multiplicative relations further
   participated in one of two studies using open problems for which both
   types of relations were appropriate: either a reaction time study (n =
   110) in which children's acceptance behavior and reaction times were
   measured or a semi-structured individual interview study (n = 18) in
   which their answers, verbalizations, and conviction scores were
   collected. Results of both studies revealed that relational preference
   was perseverant and exerted a coercive effect on children's reasoning:
   Children mostly considered only the preferential type of relation as an
   appropriate answer in open problems and rejected alternative answers.
   Furthermore, relational preference appeared as immediate, self-evident,
   and certain: Children rejected the non-preferential answer more quickly
   than an irrelevant distractor of comparable size, experienced
   difficulties in justifying why they gave their preferential answer, and
   were very convinced of this preferential answer. While this
   characterization held for both relational preferences, it was especially
   prominent for the multiplicative one. These results not only have
   implications for research on and educational practice in multiplicative
   and additive reasoning but also for the measurement of relational
   preference.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report how 5-year-olds' arithmetic skills developed
   through participation in an 8-month-long intervention. The intervention
   program aimed to enhance the children's ways of experiencing numbers'
   part-part-whole relations as a basis for arithmetic skills and was built
   on principles from the variation theory of learning. The report is based
   on an analysis of assessments with 103 children (intervention group n =
   65 and control group n = 38) before and after the intervention and a
   follow-up assessment 1 year after the intervention. Our findings show
   that the learning outcomes of the intervention group were significantly
   higher compared to those of the control group after the intervention and
   that differences between the groups remained even 1 year after the
   intervention. In particular, the results show that children
   participating in the intervention group learned to recognize and use
   part-part-whole relations in novel arithmetic tasks.},

Abstract = {We share here results from a quasi-experimental study that examines
   growth in students' algebraic thinking practices of generalizing and
   representing generalizations, particularly with variable notation, as a
   result of an early algebra instructional sequence implemented across
   grades 3-5. Analyses showed that, while there were no significant
   differences between experimental and control students on a grade 3
   pre-assessment measuring students' capacity for generalizing and
   representing generalizations, experimental students significantly
   outperformed control students on post-assessments at each of grades 3-5.
   Moreover, experimental students were able to more flexibly interpret
   variable in different roles and were better able to use variable
   notation in meaningful ways to represent arithmetic properties,
   expressions and equations, and functional relationships. This study
   provides important evidence that young children can learn to think
   algebraically in powerful ways and suggests that the earlier
   introduction of algebraic concepts and practices is beneficial to
   students.},

Abstract = {In 1968, Hans Freudenthal launched the journal Educational Studies in
   Mathematics. This paper describes the events leading to the foundation
   of this journal. It turns out that his wife, Suus Freudenthal, deserves
   more credit for her husband's interest and achievements in mathematics
   education. The couple was interested in education from a social
   democratic perspective. The events leading to the foundation of the
   journal show that lack of success for Dutch national educational
   reforms, combined with problems noted by his colleagues abroad on their
   respective reforms, triggered Hans Freudenthal to embark on this
   enterprise, and contributed to its success.},

Abstract = {Researchers have argued teachers and students are not developing
   connected meanings for function inverse, thus calling for a closer
   examination of teachers' and students' inverse function meanings.
   Responding to this call, we characterize 25 pre-service teachers'
   inverse function meanings as inferred from our analysis of clinical
   interviews. After summarizing relevant research, we describe the
   methodology and theoretical framework we used to interpret the
   pre-service teachers' activities. We then present data highlighting the
   techniques the pre-service teachers used when responding to tasks that
   involved analytical and graphical representations of functions and
   inverse functions in both decontextualized and contextualized situations
   and discuss our inferences of their meanings based on their activities.
   We conclude with implications for the teaching and learning of inverse
   function and areas for future research.},

Abstract = {This study examined immigrant parents' involvement in early years
   mathematics learning, focusing on learning of multiplication in in- and
   out-of-school settings. Ethnographic interviews and workshops were
   conducted in an urban city in Japan, to examine out-of-school practices
   of immigrant families. Drawing from sociocultural theory of learning and
   the concept of appropriation (Wertsch, 1998), the role of power and
   identity was examined in relation to children's appropriation of an
   informal multiplication method that was taught by their parents. An
   intergenerational analysis, between immigrant parents and their
   children, revealed heterogeneous perspectives towards appropriation.
   Immigrant parents in this study framed their involvement in their
   children's early years mathematics learning in relation to their
   positional identities and the pressures to conform to the mainstream
   practices of their host country. During their early years of schooling,
   students in this study were already aware of academic tracking in the
   school and were aware of what was believed to be legitimate in school
   mathematics learning. The significance of diversifying mathematics
   curriculum and pedagogy was discussed to affirm the knowledge and
   identities of immigrant students and families.},

Abstract = {This paper presents two studies of an intervention designed to help
   undergraduates comprehend mathematical proofs. The intervention used
   multimedia resources that presented proofs with audio commentary and
   visual animations designed to focus attention on logical relationships.
   In study 1, students studied an e-Proof or a standard written proof and
   their comprehension was assessed in both immediate and delayed tests;
   the groups performed similarly at immediate test, but the e-Proof group
   exhibited poorer retention. Study 2 accounted for this unexpected result
   by using eye-movement analyses to demonstrate that participants who
   studied an e-Proof exhibited less processing effort when not listening
   to the audio commentary. We suggest that the extra support offered by
   e-Proofs disrupts the processes by which students organise information,
   and thus restricts the extent to which their new understanding is
   integrated with existing knowledge. We discuss the implications of these
   results for evaluating teaching innovations and for supporting proof
   comprehension.},

Abstract = {Recent research on the professional competencies of mathematics
   teachers, which has been carried out during the last decade, is
   characterized by different theoretical approaches on the
   conceptualization and evaluation of teachers' professional competencies,
   namely cognitive versus situated approaches. Building on the
   international IEATeacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics
   (TEDS-M) and its follow-up study, TEDS-FU, the paper compares cognitive
   and situated approaches on professional competencies of teachers. In
   TEDS-FU, the cognitive oriented framework of TEDS-Mhas been enriched by
   a situated orientation including the novice-expert framework and the
   noticing concept as theoretical approaches on the analyses of classroom
   situations. Correspondingly, the evaluation instruments were extended by
   using video vignettes for assessing teachers' perception,
   interpretation, and decision-making competencies in addition to
   cognitive oriented knowledge tests. The paper discusses the different
   kinds of theoretical frameworks and the consequences for the evaluation
   methods, the strengths, and weaknesses of both approaches. Furthermore,
   connecting the results of TEDS-FU with TEDS-M allows comprehensive
   insight into the structure and development of the professional
   competencies of mathematics teachers, the complex interplay between the
   different facets of teachers' competencies, and the high relevance of
   teaching practice for the development of these competencies. The
   analyses show on the one hand that both approaches-cognitive and
   situated-are needed for a comprehensive description of teachers'
   professional competencies. On the other hand, it is shown that both
   approaches can be integrated in a productive way. The paper closes with
   prospects on further studies coming even closer to the real classroom
   situation.},

Title = {Oral counting sequences: a theoretical discussion and analysis through
   the lens of representational redescription},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {Empirical research has documented how children's early counting develops
   into an increasingly abstract process, and initial counting procedures
   are reified as children develop and use more sophisticated counting. In
   this development, the learning of different oral counting sequences that
   allow children to count in steps bigger than one is seen as an essential
   skill that supports children's mental calculation strategies. This paper
   proposes that the reification or refinement of the counting process that
   results to increased-in-sophistication use of counting is underlaid by
   the process of knowledge explicitation that the model of
   representational redescription postulates. The paper uses a case study
   to provide insight into the pathway that a 6-year-old child followed
   from learning how to verbally count in twos and tens to being able to
   use this knowledge for calculation purposes. The proposal is that
   knowledge of oral sequences is redescribed in more explicit and
   accessible formats before children are able to connect their knowledge
   of the verbal counting with the goal of using the sequence for
   calculation. The discussion presented here queries the notion of
   spontaneity as an inherent element of the theory and discusses the role
   that social interaction may play in supporting knowledge redescription.
   If it is the case that children's knowledge of oral counting sequences
   is redescribed into increasingly explicit formats before it can be
   applied for calculation, then children need to be provided early in
   their education with structured activities that trigger knowledge
   redescription and support the necessary connections between counting,
   number structure and calculation.},

Abstract = {Despite the existence of extensive literature on functions, fewer
   studies used sociocultural views to explore the development of student
   learning about the concept. This study uses a discursive lens to examine
   whether an instructional approach that specifically attends to
   particular metalevel rules in the mathematical discourse on functions
   supports students' learning of the concept in a postsecondary
   mathematics classroom. The findings suggest that such instruction has
   the potential to foster learning as indicated by the changes in the ways
   students talked about functions, and their awareness and modifications
   of the assumptions shaping their thinking about functions.},

Abstract = {Challenges for researchers wishing to gain insights into student beliefs
   about mathematics and learning include the identification of prompts to
   which young children can respond easily and which have the potential to
   provide meaningful insights into their beliefs. This article reports on
   a selection of such prompts used within an exploratory study that
   investigated beliefs about mathematics, learning and helping factors for
   learning mathematics of eight children of 8 to 9 years of age. These
   prompts, described as creative interviewing procedures, are classified
   under the key categories of visual, verbal and text-based. The article
   provides brief details of the study as background but focuses on
   discussing the nature of the tasks, and, through the inclusion of a
   selection of responses, illustrates their potential value as research
   tools for gaining insights into young children's beliefs about
   mathematics and learning. It seems that teachers could use the prompts
   to gain alternate perspectives into children's beliefs which in turn
   might inform their instruction.},

Abstract = {This article summarises what we can learn from research into workplace
   practice and vocational preparation to inform the design of mathematics
   education curricula for learners in general education undertaking
   compulsory schooling. Key findings about workplace practices are
   identified and explicated through the report of a case study from
   research in which researchers, students, teachers and workers explored
   workplace and mathematical practices together. Further to this, issues
   of learning and personal development are considered and explored from a
   point of view that sees learning as practice (doing) and identity
   development (becoming). This leads to a proposal for principles that
   provide a strategic vision for curriculum design. A potential approach
   to tactical design that facilitates curriculum structuring is
   illustrated in the particular instance of understanding developing
   measures as a modelling activity. Overall, the exercise, whilst
   providing some insight into possible ways forward in curriculum
   development, also suggests areas that require further research and
   development.},

Abstract = {In a recent paper (Weber \& Mejia-Ramos, Educational Studies in
   Mathematics, 76, 329-344, 2011), we reported findings from two
   small-scale interview studies on the reasons why and the ways in which
   mathematicians read proofs. Based on these findings, we designed an
   Internet-based survey that we distributed to practicing mathematicians
   working in top mathematics departments in the USA. Surveyed
   mathematicians (N = 118) agreed to a great extent with the interviewed
   mathematicians in the exploratory studies. First, the mathematicians
   reported that they commonly read published proofs to gain different
   types of insight, not to check the correctness of the proofs. Second,
   they stated that when reading these proofs, they commonly: (a) appeal to
   the reputation of the author and the journal, (b) study how certain
   steps in the proof apply to specific examples, and (c) focus on the
   overarching ideas and methods in the proofs. In this paper, we also
   report findings from another section of the survey that focused on how
   participants reviewed proofs submitted for publication. The comparison
   of participant responses to questions in these two sections of the
   survey suggests that reading a published proof of a colleague and
   refereeing a proof for publication are substantially different
   activities for mathematicians.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The idea that mathematics is needed for our mundane everyday activities
   has raised the question of how people deal with mathematics outside the
   school walls. Much has been written in mathematics education research
   about the possibility of transferring knowledge from and into school.
   Whereas the majority of this literature commends the possibility of
   transfer, thus assuming both the desirability of transfer and the
   importance of school mathematics for the professional and mundane lives
   of individuals, I am interested in developing an ideology critique on
   the beliefs underpinning the research on this issue. It will be argued
   that the use-value attributed to school mathematics disavows its value
   as part of a political and economic structure, which requires school
   mathematics to perform other roles than the one related with utility.
   This critique will be illustrated through the exploration of a typical
   transfer situation between school and workplace.},

Abstract = {Problem posing (not only in lesson planning but also directly in
   teaching whenever needed) is one of the attributes of a teacher's
   subject didactic competence. In this paper, problem posing in teacher
   education is understood as an educational and a diagnostic tool. The
   results of the study were gained in pre-service primary school teacher
   education. Students were asked to pose problems containing some given
   data (namely fractions). The subsequent analysis of the problems posed
   by the students revealed shortcomings in their conceptual understanding
   of fractions. Classroom-based joint reflection became the means of
   reeducation.},

Abstract = {A deep understanding of students' learning processes is one of the core
   challenges of research in mathematics education. To achieve this,
   different theoretical lenses are available. The question is how these
   different lenses compare and contrast, and how they can be coordinated
   and combined to provide a more comprehensive view on the topic of study.
   To investigate this, one single episode is analyzed with two theoretical
   lenses, the instrumental genesis perspective and the onto-semiotic
   approach. The results from this joint analysis provide a rich view on
   the observed phenomena and help to identify the affordances and
   constraints of each of the two theoretical approaches and to articulate
   them. This way, the networking of theories proves to affect theoretical
   advancements.},

Abstract = {Advisory committees of mathematics consider abstract algebra as an
   essential component of the mathematical preparation of secondary
   teachers, yet preservice teachers find it challenging to connect the
   topics addressed in this advanced course with the high school algebra
   they must someday teach. This study analyzed the mathematical content
   knowledge that developed in preservice teachers during a semester course
   in abstract algebra utilizing Lerman's
   ``person-in-practice-in-person{''} lens. This unit of analysis provided
   insights into the situated nature of the algebra learned by illuminating
   how the goals of the instructor and preservice teachers impacted the
   community of practice created in the university classroom and how
   participating in that community impacted the preservice teachers'

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The article reports aspects of the evolution of a teaching approach over
   repeated trials for beginning symbolic algebra. The teaching approach
   emphasized the structural similarity between arithmetic and algebraic
   expressions and aimed at supporting students in making a transition from
   arithmetic to beginning algebra. The study was conducted with grade 6
   students over 2 years. Thirty-one students were followed for a year, and
   data were analysed as they participated in the three trials conducted
   that year. Analysis of students' written and interview responses as the
   approach evolved revealed the potential of the approach in creating
   meaning for symbolic transformations in the context of both arithmetic
   and algebra as well as making connections between arithmetic and
   symbolic algebra. Students by the end of the trials learnt to use their
   understanding of both procedures and a sense of structure of expressions
   to evaluate/simplify expressions and reason about equality/equivalence
   of expressions both in the arithmetic and the algebraic contexts.},

Title = {Natural language as a tool for analyzing the proving process: the case

Abstract = {In the field of human cognition, language plays a special role that is
   connected directly to thinking and mental development (e.g., Vygotsky,
   1938). Thanks to ``verbal thought{''}, language allows humans to go
   beyond the limits of immediately perceived information, to form concepts
   and solve complex problems (Luria, 1975). So, it appears language can be
   studied as a cognitive process (Chomsky, 1975). In this investigation, I
   study language as a means for making the cognitive process explicit. In
   particular, I analyze the role of the verbalization produced by pairs of
   students solving a plane geometry problem. The basic idea of my research
   is that, during the resolution process of a plane geometry problem,
   natural language can play roles beyond that of communication: Natural
   language can be seen as a tool for supporting students' cognitive
   processes (Robotti, 2008), and, at the same time, it can also be seen as
   a researchers' tool which allows us to shed light on the evolution of
   students' cognitive processes. With regard to language as researchers'
   tool, I show how natural language (in our case, students' verbalization
   during resolution of a plane geometry problem) can be used by the
   researcher to make explicit, to study, and to describe the development
   of the students' cognitive processes during the resolution process. To
   this end, I present a model I have developed that allows us to identify,
   in students' verbalization, different phases of their cognitive
   processes.},

Abstract = {This paper is centered on creating equitable opportunities for learners
   in mathematics education. Through observations of teacher practice, the
   paper seeks to theorize how teachers enact their dispositions toward
   mathematics instruction. These observed propensities, in relation to
   teachers' aims for students to ``take up their space{''} in and beyond
   the mathematics classroom, then inform a model of equitable mathematics
   instruction. Teachers' dispositions are considered in relation to
   Mason's discipline of noticing and Bourdieu's notion of the symbolic
   violence of dominant discourses.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses a new philosophical perspective for
   ethnomathematics which articulates Ludwig Wittgenstein's and Michel
   Foucault's theoretical notions. It is conceived as a theoretical toolbox
   which allows the analysis of, on the one hand, the mathematical language
   games of different forms of life and their family resemblances and, on
   the other hand, the Eurocentric discourses of academic and school
   mathematics and their effects of truth. Based on fieldwork done in rural
   forms of life in the south of Brazil, examples of the use of this
   perspective are presented. The paper analyzes language games of those
   different forms of life and the school mathematics discipline,
   highlighting the complex network of learning and powers that makes other
   mathematics than that known as the mathematics be positioned ``in a
   void{''} in school curricula.},

Abstract = {We discuss contemporary theories in mathematics education in order to do
   research on research. Our strategy consists of analysing discursively
   and ideologically recent key publications addressing the role of theory
   in mathematics education research. We examine how the field fabricates
   its object of research by deploying Foucault's notion of
   bio-politics-mainly to address the object ``learning{''}aEuro{''}and
   A1/2iA3/4ek's ideology critique-to address the object ``mathematics{''}.
   These theories, which have already been used in the field to research
   teaching and learning, have a great potential to contribute to a
   reflexivity of research on its discourses and effects. Furthermore, they
   enable us to present a clear distinction between what has been called
   the sociopolitical turn in mathematics education research and what we
   call a positioning of mathematics education (research) practices in the
   Political.},

Abstract = {One of the most salient arguments in favor of a semiotic approach, put
   forward on various occasions among others by Luis Radford, claims that
   semiotics is most appropriate to treat the interaction between
   socio-cultural and objective aspects of knowledge problems. But if we
   want to take such claims seriously, we have to undertake revisions of
   our basic conceptions about reality, existence, cognition, and cultural
   development. The semiotic evolutionary realism of Charles S. Peirce
   provides, or so it appears, an appropriate basis to such intentions. Man
   is a sign, Peirce had famously said, and ``thought is more without us
   than within. It is we that are in it, rather than it in any of us{''}
   (Peirce CP 8.256). And as there is no thought without a sign, we have to
   accept thoughts, concepts, theories, or works of art as realities sui
   generis. Concepts or theories have to be recognized as real before we
   can ask for their meaning or relevance. This was the problem that
   concerned critics and protagonists of the New Math Reform of the 1960s
   and 1970s of the twentieth century, like Thom or Bruner.},

Abstract = {The idea that mathematical knowledge is embodied is increasingly taking
   hold in the mathematics education literature. Yet there are challenges
   to the existing conceptualizations: There tend to be breaks between (a)
   the living and experienced body (flesh) and linguistic forms of thought,
   (b) individual and collective forms of knowing, and (c) the material
   body and the source of intentionality. Grounded in material
   phenomenology, we theorize the living body as semiotic expression that
   not only grounds thought but also leads to its development. We provide a
   detailed case study that elucidates the three ways in which the living
   body serves as sign for the growth of a second-grade student's geometric
   understanding and the other bodies he interacts with.},

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {This article is a systematic reflection on a sequence of episodes
   related to teaching probability. Our central claim is that reducing
   problems to a consideration of the sample space, which consists of
   equiprobable outcomes, may not be in accord with learners' initial ways
   of reasoning. We suggest a ``desirable pedagogical approach{''} in which
   the solution builds on the set of outcomes as identified by learners and
   serves as a bridge towards mathematical convention. To explore
   prospective high school mathematics teachers' ideas related to
   addressing a potential learner's mistake and their reactions towards the
   suggested approach, we presented them with two tasks. In Task I,
   participants (n=30) were asked to suggest a pedagogical remedy to a
   frequent mistake found in dealing with a standard probability problem,
   whereas in Task II, they were asked to solve a probabilistic problem,
   which they had not encountered previously. We discuss participants'
   mathematical solutions to Task II in reference to their pedagogical
   approaches to Task I. The presented disparity serves in extending the
   convincing power of the suggested pedagogical approach.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Analogical reasoning is believed to be an efficient means of problem
   solving and construction of knowledge during the search for and the
   analysis of new mathematical objects. However, there is growing concern
   that despite everyday usage, learners are unable to transfer analogical
   reasoning to learning situations. This study aims at facilitating
   analogy use for conjecturing in discourse-rich mathematics classrooms.
   We reconceptualized one of the traditional perspectives on analogical
   reasoning, called classical analogy, as a more dynamic one by providing
   learners with the opportunity to choose a target object and its
   property. While shifting attention to particular aspects of mathematical
   activity, we observed and analyzed how students became aware of hidden
   relational similarities and utilized them while weakening others to make
   conjectures. The detailed analysis of the constructs and processes of
   several similarity-making and conjecturing activities supports the
   significance of reconceived classical analogy use in mathematics
   classrooms.},

Abstract = {Textbooks have the potential to be powerful tools to help students
   develop an understanding of mathematics. However, many students are
   unable to use their textbooks effectively as learning tools. This paper
   presents a framework that can be used to analyze factors that impact the
   ways students read textbooks. It adapts ideas from reader-oriented
   theory and applies them to the domain of mathematics textbooks. In
   reader-oriented theory, the reader is viewed as actively constructing
   meaning from a text through the reading process; this endeavor is shaped
   and constrained by the intentions of the author, the beliefs of the
   reader, and the qualities the text requires the reader to possess. This
   paper also discusses how reading mathematics textbooks is further
   constrained by the authority and closed structure of these textbooks.
   After describing the framework, the paper discusses recommendations for
   future avenues of research and pedagogy, highlighting the importance of
   teachers' roles in mediating their students' use of textbooks.},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {This study brings together two lines of research on teachers' affective
   responses toward mathematics curriculum reforms: their concerns and
   their efficacy beliefs. Using structural equation modeling to analyze
   data on 151 elementary mathematics teachers' concerns and efficacy
   beliefs 5 years into a mandated curriculum reform on problem solving,
   the study provides empirical support to a model integrating teachers'
   concerns and efficacy beliefs. This model suggests that teachers'
   concerns of preceding stages inform their concerns of succeeding stages;
   that teachers' efficacy beliefs about using the reform affect their task
   and impact concerns and are, in turn, informed by their self concerns;
   and that efficacy beliefs about employing pre-reform instructional
   approaches influence all types of teacher concerns. A qualitative
   analysis of data from 53 teacher logs provided additional insights into
   teachers' concerns about the reform. We discuss the policy and
   methodological implications of these findings and offer directions for
   future studies.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the efficiency of cooperative
   learning on preschoolers' verbal mathematics problem-solving abilities
   and to present the observational findings of the related processes and
   the teachers' perspectives about the application of the program. Two
   experimental groups and one control group participated in the study.
   Results found that preschoolers in the experimental groups experienced
   larger improvements in their problem-solving abilities than those in the
   control group. Findings also revealed that the cooperative learning
   method can be successfully applied in teaching verbal mathematics
   problem-solving skills during the preschool period. The preschoolers'
   skills regarding cooperation, sharing, listening to the speaker and
   fulfilling individual responsibilities in group work improved. The
   teachers' points of view also supported these findings.},

Abstract = {Mathematics teaching in Burkina Faso is faced with major challenges
   (high illiteracy rates, students' difficulties, and high failure rates
   in mathematics, which is a central topic in the curriculum). As
   evidenced in many of these studies, mathematics is reputed to be tough,
   inaccessible, and far from what students live daily. Students here look
   as though they are living in two seemingly distant worlds, school and
   everyday life. In order to better understand these difficulties and to
   contribute in the long run to a more adapted teaching of mathematics, we
   tried to document and elicit the ``mathematical resources{''} mobilized
   in various daily life social practices. In this paper, we focus on one
   of them, the counting and selling of mangoes by unschooled peasants. An
   ethnographic approach draws on the observation of the situated activity
   of counting and selling mangoes (during harvesting) and on ``eliciting
   interviews{''} of the involved actors. The analysis of results
   highlights a richness of structuring resources mobilized and distributed
   through this practice, related to what Lave (1988) call ``the
   experienced lived-in-world{''} and ``constitutive order.{''} The
   mathematical resources take the form of ``knowledge in action{''} and
   ``theorems in action{''} (Vergnaud, Rech Didact Math 10(23): 133- 170,
   1990), embedded in the social, economic, and even cultural structures of
   actors.},
